We need solutions —not militarization. We need reform —not fear.,"Like many Americans, I’ve watched with heartbreak the recent scenes from Los Angeles, where immigrant families and their allies are protesting the latest wave of federal immigration raids. 
These images are painful to witness —parents in fear, children in distress, communities on edge. Behind these protests lies a deep and growing anxiety that families will be torn apart —not because they pose a threat to public safety, but because Congress continues to fail in its duty to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

Werner Oyanadel
To be clear: I do not condone violence, looting, or civil unrest. But I cannot look away from the anguish that drives these protests. These are families, neighbors, and workers —human beings— who are watching their lives unravel while political leaders in Washington continue to stall.
Reports from across the country are alarming. Word is spreading that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are detaining Latino workers with little regard for citizenship status. Some unverified accounts have alleged that children were restrained during enforcement actions, further fueling community outrage. 
Here in Connecticut, for example, a high school senior was detained just days before graduation. These are not isolated incidents —they’re signs of a national immigration system that’s broken, blind to justice, and devastating to families. These are not members of violent gangs like the Tren de Aragua; these are individuals trying to survive, provide, and contribute.
What’s perhaps even more troubling is the erosion of due process. Consider the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia —wrongfully deported to El Salvador and only recently returned after a U.S. Supreme Court decision found the government had made a grave error. Regardless of the charges he faced, he was denied the most basic protection: his day in court. Our Constitution guarantees the presumption of innocence, and it applies to everyone under our laws, regardless of immigration status.
We are watching in real time as constitutional protections are weakened —not for theoretical reasons, but in ways that destroy real lives. Alarmingly, the federal administration has now deployed U.S. Marines to patrol Los Angeles neighborhoods, despite no request from California’s governor.  This feels like an overreach of federal power, signaling a disturbing disregard for state authority and civilian life.
Even voices within the president’s own political party are raising concerns. Florida State Sen. Ileana Garcia, co-founder of Latinas for Trump, recently called these immigration enforcement actions “inhumane.” That tells us something important: this is not about partisanship—it’s about humanity.
The Latino community is watching all of this closely. We are frustrated. We are afraid. And we are tired of being the ones who bear the brunt of a chaotic and unjust immigration system. We need solutions —not militarization. We need reform —not fear. And above all, we need our voices heard.
Nonviolent, peaceful protest remains a powerful and necessary tool in our democracy. It’s time we use it to say, clearly and without apology: enough is enough. We cannot continue to allow families to be collateral damage in a policy failure that Congress has refused to fix for decades. 
Let us raise our voices not only in protest, but in purpose —calling for real immigration reform that respects human dignity, protects due process, and restores faith in our system of laws.
History will judge how we responded to this moment. Let’s make sure we responded with integrity and humanity.

Ned Lamont has set ambitious goals for expanding rail service, yet activity on the Berkshire Line remains dormant.","Imagine yourself on a sunny cruise through the Berkshire Mountains.
Autumn colors explode outside your window as you sip your pumpkin spice latte. Now, imagine your hands off the wheel, no red lights, and no careless drivers weaving across the lanes. Just you, Mr. or Ms. Leaf-Peeper, riding a noiseless zephyr through ecstatic natural beauty.
Every autumn, thousands of daytrippers flock to the Berkshire Mountains in Massachusetts and their foothills in northwestern Connecticut. These visitors bring a welcome cash infusion into local economies, but also irritating traffic and expensive road wear. Additionally, high housing costs and clogged commuter thruways regardless of the season are issues on both sides of the border. 
It is in the best interest of these two states to consider expanding alternative modes of transportation into and through this valuable region to turbocharge economic growth while improving quality of life for residents.
The tools to do this lie at our feet. A railroad, known as the Berkshire Line, connects Danbury and Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The Berkshire Line served passengers until the 1970’s when, after car-centered development became the norm, rail services disintegrated. Today the route is owned by the Housatonic Railroad Company and only serves the occasional freight locomotive. In the towns of New Milford, Kent, Cornwall, and Canaan, passenger stations along the route have been repurposed into shops, chambers of commerce, or lie abandoned.
Connecticut now needs to commit to restoring passenger rail service on the Berkshire Line. Massachusetts has already conducted the studies, bought the tracks, and made the requisite improvements. Millions have been spent, but the line remains inactive. Why? Because without coinciding action on Connecticut’s share of the tracks, the line cannot operate at a capacity necessary to justify service. Gov. Ned Lamont has set ambitious goals for expanding rail service across the Nutmeg State, yet activity on the Berkshire Line remains dormant.


This inaction leaves Massachusetts stuck with the bill for an incomplete project, tourist dollars choked off from business owners, and no forthcoming solutions to northwestern Connecticut’s existing transportation and housing challenges. In some cases, state legislators are proposing anti-solutions, programs that drain coffers while improving nothing, like adding more lanes to our highways. The state would be better served by just setting a giant pile of money on fire. This is a simpler way to waste taxpayer dollars and increase carbon emissions while doing nothing to ease traffic or home costs.
A multifaceted solution to the issues facing Connecticut is to coordinate with local zoning boards to facilitate transit-oriented development (TOD) in areas adjacent to reactivated Berkshire Line passenger stations. This would help address statewide issues of housing costs while at the same time reducing taxpayers’ burden for the line’s operation. Presently, Connecticut is facing an artificial housing shortage due to outdated zoning codes that emphasize low-density sprawl. This nanny-state interference elevates home costs and entrenches automobile reliance. 
By reactivating passenger service along the Berkshire Line and rezoning around stations to allow for mixed-use development of moderate density (think Bedford Falls, not the Bronx) we can create a transportation artery that links hubs of pedestrian-friendly centers of cultural enrichment.
The reactivation of the Berkshire Line isn’t just about creating adorable, Rockwellian hamlets for tourists to admire, it’s also about economic stimulation and meeting the needs of our regional community. Hundreds of commuters drive from towns like Kent or Canaan into Danbury every day. These essential workers end up stuck in traffic on insufficient roads that are easily clogged. Restoring passenger service to the Berkshire Line will ease access to the region for visitors but also make transportation for existing residents more pleasant.
Litchfield County residents may hear “transit oriented development” and want to run for the (rolling, verdant) hills, but reactivating passenger service on the Berkshire Line and rezoning for common-sense density around stations will benefit everyone. By expanding rail access into the region, we can increase revenues for local communities.
 By reasonably upzoning areas adjacent to stations, we can defray tax burdens for local residents, increase the state’s desperately needed housing stock, and create a self-sustaining ridership base for the line. All of this reduces traffic on local roads and costs of maintenance for the same. When we restore passenger service to the Berkshire Line and rezone for transit-oriented development, commuters win, taxpayers win, tourists win, and residents win.

In only a few years, the Nazis rose by enflaming people with lies and hatred.  They intimidated their opposition to trample the fledgling democratic norms of the Weimar Republic on their goose-stepping march to rule, with Hitler as the legally appointed Chancellor on January 30, 1933. 
Der Führer promptly eviscerated the legislature, cowed or ignored the judges, and replaced the government apparatus with his own henchmen.  On March 22, only 51 days later, the first transports loaded with his political rivals, now prisoners of the Reich, rolled through the gates of Dachau.
Over the years, I asked myself what would I have done to stop this decline from democracy into history’s most catastrophic dictatorship and all the horrors that followed?  No matter the peril, I hoped I and enough others would have had the courage to stand in front of the gates of that first concentration camp to say, “This shall not pass.  I resist.”
Given the events of the past few years and especially since this January 20, can there be any doubt we face the same moral and political challenge?  
What are we, what am I, willing to do to prevent this current assault on our democracy, this descent into fascism mirroring those critical days of the early 1930s?  We don’t have to be passive.  Maybe speak out, text, write about, what is so plainly happening. Maybe join an organization like ACLU or Build the Resistance/50501, standing up to the would-be dictator.  Maybe march in protest or just stand silent vigil saying “…not on my watch.”
But, let it be something.  We must ensure when future generations look back on these trying times, they see how we, people committed to democracy and the rule of law, stood before the gates of looming autocratic fascism and said, “This shall not pass.  I RESIST.”
And that in this moment in history, different from 1930 German, we, the people, won.

I grew up in Tanana, Alaska, spending summers fishing the Yukon River at Rampart Rapids with my family and our 20 to 30 sled dogs. Salmon wasn’t just food: It was our life. It fed our families and our dogs, who were not only companions but essential workers and transportation in a vast, roadless region.
In the 1990s, when I was a kid, king and chum salmon were abundant. Families used fish wheels and set nets — sustainable methods passed down for generations.
Today, that way of life is vanishing.
King salmon runs have collapsed. A once-iconic symbol of Alaska is disappearing. Just last month, Alaska Airlines suspended its ceremonial red carpet fly-out of the first Copper River king salmon of the season — a clear sign of a deeper crisis already felt in coastal and river communities.
Chum salmon, the lifeblood of rural dog teams, are also disappearing. When I was young, Tanana had more than twice as many sled dogs as people, with upwards of 500 dogs in the village. Today, there are exactly 19. Not because people stopped caring, but because there simply aren’t enough fish to feed them.
Flying in commercial dog food is cost-prohibitive. A 32-pound bag of mid-grade food costs about $85, including freight, and feeds a 20-dog team for just three days in the off-season.
Despite efforts to rehome sled dogs to less remote areas, the heartbreaking reality is that when the chum runs fail, many dogs must be put down. And with them goes a deep part of Alaska’s heritage — our independence, culture and a subsistence way of life.
As a teenager, I worked with Stan Zuray, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to collect data that confirmed what fishermen already knew: King salmon were getting smaller and the runs weaker. Despite clear warnings, meaningful protections came too late.
Now, an even greater threat looms offshore.
Industrial trawlers in the Bering Sea are devastating salmon stocks. Every year, tens of thousands of king and chum salmon are unintentionally caught and discarded as bycatch — hauled up and tossed overboard, dead.
Even worse, these factory trawlers are stripping the ocean of forage fish essential to the food chain, species like herring, capelin, and especially pollock. Around 3 billion pounds of pollock are removed from the Bering Sea annually. Pollock aren’t just a product for fast food; they’re a cornerstone of the marine ecosystem, feeding salmon, seabirds, marine mammals, and more. Without them, the entire food web begins to unravel.
While small communities bear the burden of conservation — sacrificing their fisheries, their food security, and their culture — massive industrial fleets continue to harvest low-value fish for fast-food sandwiches and imitation crab.
If this story sounds familiar, it should. Look at the Columbia River: once home to legendary salmon runs, now a cautionary tale of habitat destruction, overfishing and mismanagement. Billions of dollars have been spent trying to restore Columbia River salmon and they are still failing. The truth is once wild salmon runs collapse, they rarely, if ever, come back.
The Yukon could be next.
The upper Yukon has now been closed to Chinook harvest for five years, with a seven-year moratorium set to extend that to 12. That’s 12 consecutive years on one of the most iconic and remote rivers on earth without a single legally harvested Chinook salmon. Entire generations are growing up without the traditions that once defined life on the river.
The science isn’t in dispute. Warming ocean temperatures and rising disease rates like ichthyophonus are making things worse. But industrial trawling is an immediate, human-caused crisis—and one we can do something about.
Once wild salmon runs are gone, they’re gone.
Once cultural knowledge is lost, it doesn’t return.
Once a way of life tied to the river disappears, it’s gone forever.
This isn’t just an environmental crisis. It’s cultural erasure, unfolding in real time.
Alaska’s wild salmon are iconic but they are not invincible. Without immediate, bold action to rein in the destruction caused by industrial trawlers, the future of wild salmon and the people who rely on them will be lost.
We can’t afford another decade of excuses. The time to act is now.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)A budget plan is taking shape and the clock is ticking.
Maine Morning Star will have regular updates as the committee tasked with setting that plan, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee, takes straw votes on what to include ahead of a final vote on the budget proposal to be sent to the Maine Senate and House of Representatives for consideration.
Legislative leaders have said the intention is to complete all work by June 18, what had been the statutory adjournment date for the first regular session. Though, the Legislature is now in a special session, without a formal deadline.
In March, the Democratic majority pushed through a roughly $11.3 billion, two-year budget plan without Republican support and formally adjourned in order to start the clock for those funds to become available in 90 days. 
Senate Republicans refused to back an alternative short-term plan that would have immediately filled the current deficit for MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, because it did not include structural reform to the program.
The budget that did pass continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing one-time funding for MaineCare and other urgent needs. But it didn’t include any of the policy changes Gov. Janet Mills proposed, such as tax increases and program cuts, to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
These proposals and others from lawmakers are now being weighed by the appropriations committee as it crafts the next iteration of the budget.

Adding streaming tax, upping cannabis tax and continuing free community college


By: Emma Davis - Thursday June 12, 2025 10:23 pm


















Returning on microphone after 9 p.m. Thursday night, the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee voted to include several additional taxes proposed by Gov. Janet Mills in the budget, including a tax on streaming services and increasing the sales tax on cannabis. However, the committee included a smaller amount than the governor suggested to continue funding free community college. 
The committee voted 7-4 to include Mills’ proposed new 5.5% tax on streaming services like Netflix and Spotify. 
The committee also voted 8-4 to increase the sales tax on adult use cannabis from 10% to 14%, while reducing the cannabis excise tax rates by one-third. This was not a party-line vote. Rep. Kristen Cloutier (D-Lewiston), who co-chairs the Taxation Committee, said she was not in favor of this initiative.
“I’ve been in contact with some folks who are in the cannabis industry in my district and they have really advocated loudly against this,” Cloutier said. 
With these decisions made, the committee has now decided on what to include, and not include, out of Mills’ major tax proposals. 
In addition to the streaming and cannabis taxes, earlier Thursday the committee rolled back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes and increased the cigarette excise tax at an even higher amount than Mills requested. However, the committee rejected her suggested taxes on ambulances and pharmacies.
Most debate surrounded including funding to continue Maine’s Free College Scholarship, which the committee decided to fund but at a reduced amount. 
Rather than include the $12.5 million per year sought by the governor, the committee voted 9-3 to fund the program at $10 million per year through the next biennium. 
“We’ve had to make hard decisions about what we think we can afford, not afford, and we’re supportive but we believe that they’ll be able to address a need with $10 million a year,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee.
However, to help guide decisions about continuing the program beyond that, the committee will be writing a letter to the community colleges requesting recommendations on eligibility requirements, out-of-state student funding, economy of scale and estimated future funding. 
“We had promised nights that would not be long,” committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said at 10:10 p.m. “We have just a little bit to finish up, but we will do that in the morning.” The committee is scheduled to reconvene at 9 a.m.

Budget gets bump from a “large and unusual” payment


By: Emma Davis -  5:33 pm


















The Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee announced Thursday afternoon the state has come into more cash that can be added to the budget. The additional funds are from some state agencies seeing unexpected surpluses this fiscal year. It also comes from two significant estate payments.
The majority of the committee moved all of this funding into the budget plan with 8-4 votes. 
Since the most recent revenue forecast in May, Maine received two “large and unusual” estate payments, Kirsten Figueroa, commissioner of the Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services, told the appropriations committee Thursday afternoon. This now puts the estate tax line well above what was initially expected.
“Does that mean two people passed and this is where this money came from?” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) asked.
“I do,” Figueroa responded.  
The way this funding, $24 million, will be added to the budget is also unusual, because technically the money isn’t real until the fiscal year ends on June 30. But ultimately it will be used to pay for part of the $122 million in MaineCare funding for fiscal year 2027 that the committee voted into the budget on Wednesday. 
The majority of the committee also voted into the budget millions of dollars that various departments are not planning to use up by the end of the fiscal year. Among those funds are $4.5 million from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Behavioral Health and $5 million from the Office of Disability Services.
“I would rather keep the money in the account and have it be used for what it should be used for, rather than going to the general fund, which by going into the general fund, is essentially funding MaineCare,” Fredette said.

Committee saves money by rolling back funding for mental health programs, pensions


By: Emma Davis -  12:27 pm


















While not sticking to its stated start time, the appropriations committee returned Thursday morning to take more straw votes to work toward a complete budget plan. The committee plans to return throughout the day for more votes.
Mental health
Following the deadliest mass shooting in Maine history in 2023, the state put significant resources into bolstering mental health support. However, faced with the current deficit, the appropriations committee opted to reduce some of those programs.
On Tuesday, the committee approved funding for crisis receiving centers in Penobscot and Androscoggin counties but on Thursday voted out money for these centers in Kennebec and Aroostook counties.
In the supplemental budget last year, the governor signed into law funding to develop these crisis receiving centers following the Lewiston shooting. When presenting her two-year budget plan back in January, Mills argued it was not financially feasible to build all of the centers she had hoped. 
Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison raised concern about walking back on these commitments and said the centers were a point of rare bipartisan agreement last year, though the overall budget was passed mostly along party lines with Democrats in favor. 
“As someone who actually voted for the funding for this in the previous budget, this is a difficult cut for me to accept,” said committee co-chair Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook). 
Regarding Aroostook County in particular, Gattine said he spoke with the Department of Health and Human Services, whose representatives think that this specific model might not be the best for that rural area, so they may suggest an alternative crisis model in the future. 
The committee also removed funding for 24 mental health law enforcement liaisons to support mental health crisis intervention, and mobile response services.
The majority of the appropriations committee also voted to make cuts to various mental health services.
The committee voted 7-5 to provide county jails $4 million for medication assisted treatment to address drug dependency in fiscal year 2026, but did not include funding for the following year, which Gattine explained could be revisited in a supplemental budget next year. The committee also reduced funding for employee recruitment and retention of staff that provide medication management services within the Office of Behavioral Health.
Mills proposed a number of reductions to the overall state budget, focusing on new programs  that had not yet been fully started. While Gattine again reiterated the cuts are not something he takes lightly, he said, “I really came back to the fact that the baseline of MaineCare, everything that we have funded, provides millions and billions of dollars of support for behavioral health needs. I don’t think we support those needs enough. I’m hoping we can continue to do things to support the needs of people with behavioral health needs.”
Pensions 
Another area where the majority of the committee proposed to save money is rolling back the state’s pension deductions for those with higher incomes.
The committee voted 8-5 to incorporate Mills’ proposal to phase-out a current deduction offered for nonmilitary pensions, though changed the thresholds. 
Mills proposed a phase-out beginning with income over $100,000 for individuals, $150,000 for heads of households and $200,000 for married individuals filing jointly. But the committee backed phase outs starting at $125,000 for individuals, $187,500 for heads of household, and $250,000 for joint filers. 
“The money that we’re taking belongs to them,” Rep. Mark Blier (R-Buxton) said in protest. “It doesn’t belong to us.”
Paid Family and Medical Leave 
The committee voted 7-5 to include funding the governor proposed to help cover the costs of the community college system, Maine Maritime Academy and the University of Maine System for the state-supported positions related to the new Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, which took effect on Jan. 1. 
However, the committee reduced the allocations Mills suggested for the university system, which Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee, said it was because the system negotiated with a company that is allowing them to get premiums to cover some of the cost. 
Amid the voting, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) wanted to specify that this is one-time funding to cover the initial cost of the paid family leave program, after Republicans raised concerns about the state being on the hook. The committee ultimately incorporated that note.
“So you are going to take the lollipop away from the baby,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “I’m anxious to see that. Thank you.”
Additional decisions
The majority of the committee also approved an increase from $5 to $7 for fishing license fees. 
Also, following the request of the Legislative Council, which is made up of the ten elected members of leadership, the committee agreed to incorporate several temporary legislative positions, though did not go so far as to make them permanent.

Increased cigarette tax, rejected child care cuts, funded MaineCare


By: Emma Davis - Wednesday June 11, 2025 10:50 pm


















The budget took more of a shape Wednesday night, though, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said, “we are determined to get this budget done in the daylight,” so the committee is reconvening at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday. 
Substantial decisions were made Wednesday night when the committee reconvened, including increasing Maine’s cigarette tax more than Gov. Janet Mills’ had proposed, rejecting Mills’ proposed cuts to child care worker stipends and Head Start, and adding funding for MaineCare. 
When Mills first proposed her budget in January, a key component she highlighted to address the deficit was her plan to raise revenue through a $1 increase in the cigarette excise tax — from $2 per pack to $3 — and corresponding increases to the excise tax on other tobacco-related products.
The majority of the appropriations committee voted 8-4 to increase it by $1.50.
Since Mills released her proposal, Republicans have been steadfast about their opposition to raising this tax, and to tax increases of any kind. On Wednesday those in the minority party on the committee again made that stance clear.
“I was shocked when the governor came out with the original proposed tax increase on the cigarettes of a buck,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said, “and now to throw it up to a buck and a half. I see in my opinion, with all due respect to everyone around this horseshoe, a lack of ability to make tough decisions on where we’re going to spend money in this state.”
When Mills presented her proposal back in January, she touted it as a way to help generate revenue while simultaneously reducing public health costs in the long-term by disincentivizing people to smoke. Sen. Cameron Reny (D-Lincoln) highlighted that goal in voicing her support for upping the tax, stating that her stepfather recently died of cancer caused by cigarettes.
But Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata (R-New Gloucester) countered, “I don’t feel like it’s responsible to base our budget on revenue that we hope will go down.”
The majority of the committee, voting 7-5, subsequently approved about $122 million for MaineCare, filling a gap left in the initial two-year budget passed in March that did not include MaineCare funding for the second year of the biennium. 
“I do believe we should pay our bills, but we also had reforms to hopefully reduce that amount that we’re paying,” Arata said, referring to proposals to implement work requirements and other reforms to the program that failed to be included in the supplemental budget for the current fiscal year. “Therefore, I can’t support this motion.”  
The majority almost entirely rejected the governor’s proposed cuts related to child care programs, with one exception. 
Voting 7-5 again, the committee removed from the budget plan Mills’ proposal to reverse the state’s recent investments in child care by reducing worker stipends by $30 million to bring them back to 2022 levels. With the same vote breakdown, the committee also rejected Mills’ proposal to cut funding for Head Start by $7 million. 
That same majority also rejected a proposed $2.5 million cut in fiscal year 2026 to the child care employment award program, which includes child care staff in the Maine Child Care affordability program, however the committee chose to remove funding for the award program in 2027. 
“This was styled as a two-year pilot program, so our intent is to continue the pilot program in 2026, not provide funding for it in fiscal year 2027 at this time,” said Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “We’ll have a chance to evaluate that next year when we reconvene.”  
Although a budget-neutral move, one decision Wednesday night received praise from Republicans. 
Mills proposed elevating the current Governor’s Energy Office to a cabinet-level department in her budget plan but the committee removed that change Wednesday, in light of a separate bill moving through the Legislature that seeks to do that. 
“I appreciate the fact that we are letting this kind of an initiative be debated as it should be in the policy committees and brought to the floor for a vote,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison.

Preserving Maine State Grant Program


By: Emma Davis -  3:58 pm


















Wednesday morning the appropriations committee made a number of reductions to the governor’s proposed funding for various departments. Returning briefly just after 3 p.m., the majority of its members chose to again reject a proposal from Mills, following requests from private higher education institutions. 
Currently, all Maine public and private universities, colleges and technical schools that administer federal financial aid, such as the Pell Grant and Direct Loans, are eligible for something called the Maine State Grant Program, which provides need-based assistance.
The governor proposed cutting Maine’s private colleges from the program, which educators and students pushed back on during the public hearing. The Education and Cultural Affairs Committee also requested the change be rejected. The appropriations committee followed suit Wednesday voting the change out of the plan 8-2. 
“Stay tuned,” appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) said after the afternoon votes. “We will be back later. I’m not quite sure when but we will be back.”

Mobile home program funded while judiciary requests pared down


By: Emma Davis - Tuesday June 10, 2025 6:50 pm


















Indicative of the lack of sleep and long hours legislators are working, appropriations committee co-chair Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin) accidentally called a vote as unanimous as the committee met while the Senate was still in session Tuesday afternoon. 
The mishap was met with laughs as it was bookended by votes on a number of items — none of which were unanimous. 
The majority of the committee backed one-time funding — a transfer of $3 million from the unappropriated surplus of the general fund to the Maine State Housing Authority — for the manufactured and mobile home park preservation and assistance program. This was a request in a bill that passed the chambers but was placed on the appropriations table. 
There are currently more than 100 bills on this table, which is managed by the appropriations committee. Bills that cost money that hasn’t already been allocated are placed here to vie for remaining unappropriated funding — or, as evidenced by this case, could instead be included in the budget plan. 
After the committee sets the budget, one of its final acts will be to “run the table” and decide which of the remaining bills will receive funds.
Other items added into the plan include one-time funding to upgrade courtrooms with video conferencing technology. However, the committee also moved out numerous other proposals related to the judiciary, such as funding for new positions, resources and ​​increasing the number of jurors called to jury duty.
“I think we’re shortchanging the judiciary,” said Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport). 
Rep. Drew Gattine (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee, said he believed many of the items the committee ultimately voted out were important. 
“I think by the time we’re done here, there will be over $20 million in new funding approved for them, and I hope the process is that they’re able to come back and we’re able to do more for them over time,” Gattine said.

A move to maximize federal match for free school meals


By: Emma Davis -  11:34 am


















Amid chamber work Tuesday morning, the majority of the Appropriations Committee voted in favor of a change aimed to maximize federal dollars for free school lunches in order to save the state an expected $2 million. 
After the COVID-19 pandemic, Maine became one of a handful of states to pass legislation making school meals free.
“[That] took away that stigma and took away that paperwork that was associated with individual families and individual students, so now everybody in the school district does qualify,” said Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education and Cultural Affairs Committee. “But we do have some school districts that have not enrolled in the program, so we’re not able to maximize the federal funding that’s available.”
After the committee voted to pay the difference between the federal reimbursement and full price of meals for schools that participate in the National School Lunch Program, Brennan introduced an amendment to require that in order for schools to get this state funding they must first enroll in the free meal program in a way that makes them eligible for the maximum money available at the federal level. The committee approved the change with a 9-2 straw vote. 
Much of the committee’s work has been approving, or rejecting, a number of state government positions. Republicans have continued to raise objections to expanding state government personnel. 
“I think one thing we can agree on is that it’s all a balance,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), co-chair of the committee. “And, maybe we balance things in different places, but finding the right balance is part of what this is all about.”

Another of Gov. Mills’ proposed taxes removed from plan


By: Emma Davis - Monday June 9, 2025 4:53 pm


















Monday morning at the State House began with more talk about taxes as the Appropriations Committee continued its line-by-lines votes on what to include in the budget. 
The majority of the committee voted to remove Mills’ proposed tax on ambulance services, which is one of several tax increases the governor proposed as a means to address the deficit and flattening revenues. 
The tax on non-municipal ambulance service providers would have been equal to 6% of their net operating revenue, which the Mills administration said it would have used to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements.
While Republicans on the committee said they supported removing the tax — as the minority party has made clear it will not support tax increases of any kind — they questioned how the state will deal with those shortfalls and pay for additional spending the committee has approved. 
One example from Monday was reallocating the cost of an emergency coordinator position that is partially funded through federal expenditures to being completely supported by the general fund. 
“We’re moving positions and costs into the general fund, and my only question is, where is that money coming from?” Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) asked. “Is it coming from more tax increases? Is it coming from cutting other programs that we haven’t gotten to yet, or what?”
Sen. Peggy Rotundo (D-Androscoggin), who co-chairs the committee, responded, “As we build this budget, we will take care of that in one way or another so that the budget will balance at the end.” 
It is not yet clear whether the committee will support some of Mills’ other proposed taxes or the cuts she proposed to health and child care programs. So far, the committee also voted out a proposed pharmacy tax. 
Implications from federal funding cuts were also top of mind. 
The coordinator position was one of several that the committee readjusted to be more reliant on state funding, though Mills made those recommendations before President Donald Trump’s administration began rescinding congressionally appropriated funds. 
“We have talked about the fact that if federal funds disappear, positions disappear,” Rotundo said. 
But some concerns about federal funding predated Trump’s second term. During the public hearing for the budget bill, the Maine Emergency Management Agency said budget deficits related to federal funding had already resulted in the agency leaving two positions vacant. 
The committee voted to fund two positions fully with the general fund, after they’d previously been supported solely by federal dollars. 
“It was important to make sure that these positions were preserved and that it was worth the investment in additional general fund dollars,” said Rep. Drew Gattie (D-Westbrook), the other co-chair of the committee.

With less than two weeks left, lawmakers still debating budget plan


By: Emma Davis -  4:51 pm


















During the committee’s last meeting on Thursday, the majority of its members rejected a tax on Maine pharmacies the governor had proposed, while voting in favor of additional funding and rate reform for nursing homes. 
The pharmacy tax would have imposed a 70-cent tax on every outpatient prescription filled by Maine pharmacies, the revenue from which the Mills administration said it would use to leverage additional federal dollars and eventually increase MaineCare reimbursements. 
“I haven’t voted for any items,” said Republican budget lead Jack Ducharme of Madison on Thursday. “Yet, this will be my first, because I believe that we already collect too much taxes.” 
With a 10-2 vote, other Republicans backed removing the tax too, though the holdouts noted that their opposition was because of a lack of clarity about the overall budget plan. 
“I applaud the work of the majority in terms of removing this,” Rep. Ken Fredette (R-Newport) said. “However, I will be consistent in reviewing the overall global budget in determining whether or not I will support it.” 
That sentiment was also shared ahead of the committee voting 9-3 in favor of $20 million in additional funding for nursing homes over the biennium. This includes a $6.5 million investment for rate reform to support the direct care workforce and incentivize permanent staff, which would in turn unlock $12.2 million in funding from the federal government. 
“Nursing home rate reform is very important to us, however at this particular time we have not had a discussion about where additional general funds come from that we’re going to need,” Ducharme said. “In order for me to support this, even though I would historically support something like this, I want to know where the money’s coming from.”
Other Republicans had a different take. While Rep. Amy Bradstreet Arata of New Gloucester would also like to know where the funds are coming from, “I feel right about supporting this,” she said. “I might not support the entire package, but I feel better knowing that this is in there, ultimately.”

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)Despite pressure from the Trump administration to repeal protections for transgender student athletes, lawmakers in the Maine Senate late Thursday rejected legislation that would restrict transgender students’ access to school sports and bathrooms.
The majority of the chamber also shot down an effort to roll back state law that establishes a process for someone at least 16 years old to access gender-affirming health care.
The bills —  LD 1134 and LD 380 — mark the first of several targeting transgender rights that will go before lawmakers in the Maine Senate and House of Representatives in the coming days.
LD 1134 would specifically ban transgender girls from playing girls sports or using girls bathrooms or locker rooms. It is one of three similar proposals this session that require trans students to adhere to sports and facilities that align with the sex assigned at birth.
The Senate voted 21-14 in support of a motion to reject the measure, with Sen. Rick Bennett of (R-Oxford) joining Democrats against the bill.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Bennett commended the students who spoke up on “every side of the issue.” 
Transgender teens and allies crowd State House to fight anti-trans bills

“These are Maine kids and they deserve to grow up in a state where they are safe, respected and seen,” he said.
Referring to those who say the bill seeks to put the state in compliance with federal anti-discrimination protections, he said those questions are “already being addressed in courts where they belong. What we are being asked today is something different: deciding if our laws will affirm the dignity of every child in Maine, or diminish it.”
Many of the bill’s critics focused on what they said were inherent biological differences between males and females and the superior athleticism of males.
Bill sponsor Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) told her colleagues she meant no disrespect to the trans community with the bill. 
“I’m merely recognizing biological strengths and differences that exist,” she said. “It’s also what’s inherently fair and unfair about requiring girls to compete against trans athletes. There’s nothing new about leveling the playing field in sports.”
Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot), however, pointed out that trans women and girls have been competing alongside cisgender girls in sports in Maine for decades without much fanfare. “This is nothing new,” he said. “What is new is the outsized and disproportionate focus on their lives, especially on what trans kids get to do at school.”
He continued, “Banning a group of kids from playing sports alongside their classmates simply because of who they are is not about ensuring fairness. It’s about drawing a line of exclusion. And for trans youth, who already face significantly higher rates of bullying, depression and suicide, being told they don’t belong will have serious consequences for their health and their well being.”
The Senate also voted 21-14 against LD 380, which would no longer allow minors that are at least 16 years old to consent to gender-affirming care, which can include a wide range of services, including hormone therapy and counseling.
Debate centers on fairness and safety during hearing on transgender sports bills

Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot), who sponsored the legislation, said parents should know what children are doing, “in all facets of life,” until they are 18 years old. 
Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said the current law was passed after “exhaustive study and debate in the 131st Legislature. There’s no reason to change.”
Hundreds of people attended the May public hearing on the slate of anti-trans bills, the vast majority of whom were there in support of trans students. Citing national attacks on trans rights, students, parents of trans youth, faith leaders, educators and other community members testified against the proposals.
In 2021, the Maine Human Rights Act was amended to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. But that policy has been the subject of debate and scrutiny since President Donald Trump threatened to withhold federal funding unless Maine complies with his executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently suing the state over what it says are violations of Title IX, which protects against discrimination in schools. 
Other legislation expected to appear before the House and Senate include proposals to restrict the rights of students to use affirming pronouns and broader bills attempting to remove gender identity as part of the Maine Human Rights Act.

Mike Dunleavy vetoed more than $122 million from Alaska’s annual budget plan before signing it into law Thursday.
The governor’s vetoes fell heaviest on education, as Dunleavy eliminated more than $50 million from the state’s per-student education funding formula and tens of millions intended for school maintenance. 
It’s the first time in state history that a governor has failed to fully fund the education formula, a precedent-breaking act akin to former Gov. Bill Walker’s decision in 2016 to veto part of the Permanent Fund dividend, which until then had been decided by a previously sacrosanct formula.
Dunleavy also vetoed budget language designed to prevent excess spending from the state’s Higher Education Investment Fund, which is ordinarily intended to pay for high school students’ scholarships. The governor chose to take money from the fund rather than the reserves of the state’s investment bank, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority.
The governor announced his vetoes without a news conference or lengthy statement, instead releasing a prerecorded video earlier on Thursday stating that the vetoes, which cover both the state’s annual operating budget bill and the capital budget bill, were required by the state’s fiscal situation.
Oil prices have fallen significantly over the past year, leading to dwindling state revenue. The governor’s vetoes relied on a new state revenue forecast unavailable to lawmakers when they drafted the budget.

(George Frey/Getty Images)A low heat that’s simmered for weeks over an attempt to lower prescription drug prices in Louisiana increased to a boil Thursday in the waning hours of the state legislative session, with Gov. Jeff Landry saying he will bring lawmakers back to Baton Rouge to address prescription drug policy. 
The eight-week regular session ended with lawmakers backing the less stringent of two measures aimed at regulating pharmacy benefit managers, often referred to as PBMs or “middlemen” that oversee prescription drug programs for insurance companies and large employers.  
PBMs have faced increasing criticism from patient advocate groups who blame them for high medication prices, while independent drugstore owners say they unfairly favor large corporate pharmacies. Some of the country’s largest pharmacy chains, including CVS, also operate a PBM, which critics have said leads fewer pharmacy and medication options for consumers. 
Landry wanted lawmakers to pass a  more aggressive bill that would have prohibited companies from owning drug stores and pharmacy benefit managers, which would have threatened companies such as CVS who own both. The Senate declined to bring House Bill 358, by Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, up for a final vote, however, allowing it to die before the legislative session ended. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Instead, the legislature passed what had been seen as a compromise between the corporate chains and independent pharmacists in House Bill 264, by Rep. Mike Echols, R-Monroe. The bill requires PBMs to be more transparent about their practices with state regulators and to pass more prescription savings on to consumers.  

The Senate also hastily drafted and approved a resolution instructing the Louisiana Department of Health to study the impact of banning PBMs from also owning pharmacies and to produce a report on the subject ahead of the legislature’s 2026 regulation session next March. 
,Landry was upset the lawmakers didn’t go farther, however, and threatened to haul the lawmakers back into session later this summer to pass the same proposal. 
“Yes we will have a special session to lower prescription drugs for our citizens. It’s that important!” Landry said in an email from his spokeswoman Kate Kelly shortly before the bill failed. 
It’s not clear when the governor would call a special session focused on PBMs. Several lawmakers said he was already on his way to France for the International Paris Air Show which starts Monday. He cannot sign off on the paperwork needed for a special session while outside of the state of Louisiana.  

I am committed to lowering drug prices, and I am hopeful our senators are too!
Lowering drug prices for our seniors and all of Louisiana!
If we fail to pass the meaningful first steps that the House passed yesterday, we can come back over the summer to finish it!
— Governor Jeff Landry (@LAGovJeffLandry) June 12, 2025

Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, told reporters after adjournment the complexity of Miller’s bill, along with feedback from stakeholders, led to the decision to back alternative measures. . 
“The more that members had the opportunity to really digest what that bill would do – and the conversations they were having back home with both their local pharmacy, the chain pharmacist, who it was going to affect – we really had a difficult time getting a true grasp of what the bill was going to do,” Henry said. 
The Senate president said opposition from senators to the Miller bill grew over the day Thursday as more constituents and lobbyists reached out to members. He also said a special session on PBM legislation seems unnecessary because the Landry-backed bill wasn’t even supposed to get implemented for another two years. 

“I don’t know why you would call a special session for a bill that doesn’t take effect until 2027,” Henry said. 
Arkansas approved a law similar to the Miller bill earlier this year and currently faces federal lawsuits from two of the country’s largest pharmacy benefit managers. Henry expressed reluctance to follow their lead.  
The Miller proposal drew strong opposition from a plaintiff in one of the Arkansas cases – CVS, which owns the pharmacy benefit manager CVS Caremark. Its campaign to defeat the bill included sending text messages to thousands of members of the public, including state employees and their families Thursday, which led the governor to direct Attorney General Liz Murrill to investigate the company’s actions.
CVS Caremark contracts with the state Office of Group Benefits for billions of dollars to manage insurance coverage for state employees and retirees.   
“This is not an appropriate use of personal information obtained through a state contract.” Murrill said Thursday morning in a news release. 
CVS had said the Miller bill would force it to close more than 125 stores in Louisiana, leading 2,700 employees to lose their jobs. 
“Closing drug stores doesn’t lower drug prices. Forcing out 20% of the state’s pharmacies only makes pharmacy deserts worse,” Amy Thibault, CVS executive director of corporate communications, said in an email. 
When Echols made the final pitch for his compromise legislation Thursday in the House, he singled out CVS for criticism, noting he had talked with Murrill about her pursuing charges against the company for violating terms of its state contract when it sent its mass text message to state workers.
“This House is not for sale. This legislature cannot be bullied,” Echols said. 
Randal Johnson, with the Louisiana Independent Pharmacies Association, said the Echols bill will be a vast improvement over the current PBM regulations in Louisiana. 

“We believe the consumer will have an opportunity to find out what their drugs costs, and the consumer will have the opportunity to have a less expensive cost of medication” under the Echols legislation, Johnson said. 
A special session can last no longer than 30 days, and its subject matter will be limited to what Landry wants to discuss if he decides to call it.

Spencer Cox makes a high bet on nuclear energy, advancing processes to make Utah a nuclear hub, the state announced it is studying to lease military land for an uranium enrichment facility.
Newcomer company Utah Energy is planning to sublease a piece of Camp Williams, located at the south end of Bluffdale, to refine uranium into concentrations to make it a suitable fuel for nuclear reactors. 
That uranium will then be transported by semitrucks to nuclear facilities as needed, Drew DeWalt, a representative from Utah Energy— and also behind other similar projects in other states, including Washington, said at the Thursday announcement hosted by the company, the Utah Department of Natural Resources, the Utah Office of Energy Development, and the Military Installation Development Authority.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With a push from the White House to accelerate nuclear energy developments, DeWalt said that this processing is going to happen somewhere in the U.S., and odds are it will happen in Utah for its location and its government’s willingness to embrace the resource. But, mostly, what he wanted to convey during the announcement was that the facility should be “safe, necessary and important” for neighboring communities. 
As Cox advances nuclear agreements, he says the cost to develop technology is nothing so far

“This is really a closed-loop system. The major risks are not to the public, but to our employees,” DeWalt said, adding that staff would face standard industrial risks in the project, especially since it would be a process the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would carefully oversee.
This isn’t a done deal. It’s the start of an engagement process that could take years, DeWalt said. The lease proposal will be subject to the review of the Military Installation Development Authority Board and other legislative panels within the next two weeks. 
Ariana Farber, deputy director for the Military Installation Development Authority, said this project is designed similarly to the Falcon Hill Project Area at Hill Air Force Base, which leased federal property for an aerospace research park. 
“The National Guard project area was created to facilitate infrastructure that supports military operations. The project directly contributes to that mission,” Farber said about the uranium processing facility, “and it’s in alignment with our state of Utah energy initiatives from the governor’s office, and also in alignment with our national security posture.”
In combination with other developments, this project will help fund large-scale capital projects for the Utah National Guard, Farber said, including a new aviation facility contemplated in rural southern Utah, an enhanced wildfire response and emergency deployment capabilities.



Let us know what you think...


 


Utah officials who have championed nuclear energy developments, including Cox in a recent op-ed published in the Deseret News, criticized the fact that about 25% of the enriched uranium used in U.S. nuclear reactors comes from Russia. About 70% of all enriched uranium used in the country in 2023 came from other countries, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. 
According to DeWalt, the Camp Williams project may solve inefficiencies in the current fuel supply chain, which often requires the transportation of uranium to Europe for processing, since there aren’t enough facilities in the country. 
Now, with a “nuclear renaissance” in sight propelled by President Donald Trump, Utah has been moving fast to implement the technology on its soil — the Legislature already approved a big bill to set up the foundation for nuclear energy and state officials signed a couple of memorandums of understanding with nuclear technology developers. 
That momentum is something DeWalt is hoping to tap into.
“​​How much faster could you do this and still be safe? I think there’s got to be a happy medium where there’s a lot of unnecessary bureaucratic delay,” he said. “Can we strip that out, and can we still be safe?”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Ahead of a day of national protest against the Trump administration’s deportation tactics and deployment of troops to Los Angeles to quell resistance, Pennsylvania leaders and scholars cautioned against allowing anger to set the tone.
“We can’t allow ourselves to be moved by our emotions, because the anger that is being provoked, there’s a reason for it,” Kenneth Nuriddin, resident imam of The Philadelphia Masjid said Thursday. He warned protestors that yielding to violence would distract from their message and justify a violent government response.
America’s immigrant communities have reasons to be angry, Nuriddin, who is the mosque’s spiritual leader, said. He spoke at a news conference Thursday with Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner before a planned protest Saturday in the city.
“There’s a promise — give me your tired, your poor — that is in the harbor in New York City, inviting people to come. And many people have come because of that invitation,” Nuriddin said, adding the promise has been broken and the invitation rescinded.
Philadelphia is one of hundreds of cities where a partnership of labor, Democratic and anti-Trump organizations have planned non-violent demonstrations to counter the unprecedented military parade Saturday in Washington, D.C., set to coincide with President Donald Trump’s birthday. 
Krasner vowed to protect the rights of those who protest lawfully in Philadelphia.
“That is our oath,” Krasner said. “But, we will also hold accountable anyone and everyone, whether they are uniformed ICE agents or opportunistic criminals.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gov. Josh Shapiro emphasized his support of protesters’ First Amendment rights, while issuing his own warning against criminal activity. Shapiro said he’s working with Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker’s office and law enforcement. State and local police  will also be coordinating.
“The right to peacefully protest and exercise our First Amendment is a sacred American right — and here in Pennsylvania, we will always protect it,” Shapiro said.
But he added, “I want to be very clear: all protests and demonstrations must remain peaceful, lawful, and orderly. Violence is not an answer to any political differences. Destruction and chaos are unacceptable — and neither will be permitted here in Pennsylvania.”
Dickinson College President John E. Jones III , who is a retired federal judge, told the Capital-Star he fears Trump’s willingness to use military force to tamp down opposition could lead to a tragedy like the massacre at Kent State in 1970 by Ohio National Guard troops who shot and killed four and wounded nine unarmed student protesters. 
“We’re a military gunshot away from a sort of national crisis,” Jones said, noting that troops are forbidden from carrying out civilian law enforcement in the United States because they’re not trained for it.

“You’re relying on hundreds of troops to hold their fire in the face of hostile activity and maybe even demonstrations that bait them,” Jones said. “It only takes one to fire in a fit of anger or apprehension and we’ve crossed a line that will be very difficult to return from.
Since President Trump took the oath of office for the second time in January, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has conducted raids across the nation.
Such tactics have been standard in other administrations for decades. But those conducted in the last six months have been more aggressive, with agents in unmarked vehicles wearing face coverings targeting workers, foreign students and those with pending immigration cases.
Public outrage over the raids reached a boil in the last week as protesters in Los Angeles clashed with law enforcement and Trump responded by deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines into the city. 
And it reached a new crescendo among elected leaders Thursday as California Democratic U.S. Senator Alex Padilla was shoved to the floor and handcuffed by FBI agents after he attempted to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions, while she was holding a news conference in LA.
The FBI said in a statement that Padilla, who interrupted Noem’s formal remarks, was not wearing his Senate security pin, which law enforcement uses to quickly identify lawmakers. But  he was released after being identified.

Padilla’s fellow lawmakers condemned the administration’s treatment of the senator.
“It’s horrible. It is shocking at every level. And it’s not the America I know,” U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told reporters.
Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman said in a tweet he was sad to see what happened to Padilla, who “deserved much better.”
“We collectively must turn the temperature down and find a better way forward for our nation,” Fetterman’s tweet said.
Pennsylvania U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District) called videos of the incident “terrible and frightening,” in a tweet.
“If the Trump regime can do this to a sitting United States Senator, then truly no American is safe,” Boyle’s tweet said.
Retired Duquesne University constitutional law professor Bruce Ledewitz told the Capital-Star while the Trump administration’s reaction to Padilla confronting Noem is unfortunate, he described it as “performative fascism.” 
“This is Trump clearly indicating to the executive branch that, ‘We want to look tough. We want to look mean,’” Ledewitz said “He means this to be a performance. He doesn’t mean anyone to get hurt.”
Ledewitz said the incident doesn’t rise to the level of a constitutional crisis, noting that while members of Congress are cloaked with the immunity to liability for their speech and actions in the performance of their duties, the Speech and Debate clause “doesn’t include interrupting press conferences.”

Jones offered the same assessment of Padilla’s Speech and Debate protections.
“In my experience that hasn’t extended to the kind of statements that triggered, literally triggered, FBI agents to push him to the floor and put him in handcuffs,” Jones said.
While Padilla might have a claim under the Fourth Amendment against excessive force he could raise in a civil lawsuit, Jones said he’s doubtful that would be worth the lawmaker’s  effort.
Nonetheless, there was no justification for the reaction to Padilla’s attempt to question Noem, Jones said. He noted that he recently has spoken out against the rhetoric Trump adviser Stephen Miller and others have used to attack judges. 
“Although I would wish for someone high in the administration to make a statement to try to ratchet down the overheated climate, I was fairly certain that would not happen,” Jones said, adding that entreaties like those from Krasner and the clergy who joined him Thursday are unlikely to stop it.
“I think it’s going to be a long, hot summer,” he said.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Nebraska House Republicans joined a GOP majority Thursday in advancing a White House request to claw back $9.4 billion the federal government had already approved for international aid and funding for public media.
The legislation revokes more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development.
It also would rescind all funding Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, totaling $1.1 billion. 
Every vote mattered
It passed the House on a largely party-line vote of 214-212. The proposal now goes to the U.S. Senate, where it needs a simple majority to pass. The Senate would need to act before mid-July to approve the cuts, States Newsroom reported.
The Trump Administration is on track to do what two previous GOP administrations sought to do — strip federal funding for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service. 
“For decades, Republicans have promised to cut NPR, but have never done it, until now,” Trump said during the vote on Truth Social. “The Rescissions Bill is a NO BRAINER, and every single Republican in Congress should vote, ‘YES.’ MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
The push is just another step in the White House’s political battle with the media.  Trump and some House GOP members said they are fulfilling their pledge to cut the organizations’ funding. 
U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s rural 3rd Congressional District and Mike Flood, who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, had telegraphed support for the proposal for days. But Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the Omaha-based 2nd District, had told the New York Times earlier this week he was a no on the rescissions package, saying he wouldn’t follow His “party off the cliff.”
Behind Bacon’s flip
Bacon flipped his vote to yes after a brief floor conversation with House Speaker Mike Johnson as the vote was held open. States Newsroom also reported that New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota also changed his vote after a similar talk.

Bacon told the Nebraska Examiner on Thursday that he got reassurances from House GOP leadership to find funding for international AIDS prevention and at least some funding for public media. 
“I was reassured by House Republican leadership that PBS would receive funding for next year, and it would go to annual funding after that,” Bacon said. “They also told me that PEPFAR funding for life-saving treatments will not be affected. Because of these reassurances, I voted yes on H.R. 4.”
PEPFAR, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched by former President George W. Bush in 2003. 
Bacon had previously said that if Nebraska Public Media loses funding, its “absence” would “leave a void.”
Bacon’s critics, including the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said it continued a trend of Bacon saying one thing publicly to sound moderate and ultimately voting with the party — though he recently voted against party lines for a bill that would rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
“How many times have we seen this same tired act from him?” DCCC Spokesperson Madison Andrus said. 
Budget impact
While federal funding accounts for only a fraction of the budget for national independent public news organizations, it does help smaller, often rural, local affiliate stations afford to operate in places the free market might not serve. 
The impact of the cuts on Nebraska Public Media could be significant, up to 16% of its annual budget, which could put essential services, including emergency alert systems, at risk, the organization has said. NPM is responsible for most public TV and radio stations in the state. It receives approximately $4 million in federal funding, representing roughly 16% of its annual budget. 
Nebraska Public Media is tasked with live-streaming the legislative session and public hearings on bills. NPM also covers state government daily during legislative sessions. NPM also broadcasts and streams local high school and college sports. It also issues essential vital alerts for severe storms and other emergencies. 
The state funds roughly 44% of the NPM budget, according to information published on the NPM website. 
Nebraska Public Media officials said they were “disappointed in the outcome of this vote” as “clawing back funding already approved by Congress threatens the core mission of public media, especially in rural areas.” 
“These aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet,” NPM General Manager and CEO Stacey Decker said. “Federal investment underpins the journalism we produce, the educational resources we share with children and families, the remarkable stories we tell about our state.” 
Not just NPM
KIOS, a smaller Omaha public radio station that Omaha Public Schools operates, received approximately $154,000 this year in federal funding. Omaha Public Schools officials decline to comment on the vote but are monitoring the potential impact on the station.
Flood, in a joint statement with the House Main Street caucus, said the rescission package “codifies important spending cuts identified by the Trump administration.” 
“This package ends funding for foreign programs that are antithetical to American values, stops woke gender and climate programs and reins in wasteful spending,” the statement reads. 
Flood in May echoed criticisms of NPR’s national bias but defended the value Nebraska Public Media provides locally in previous Examiner reporting. 
Smith called the package another “step toward fiscal responsibility.” 
“I will continue working with the administration and my colleagues to follow through on spending priorities overwhelmingly supported by the American people at the ballot box last November,” Smith said.

These rallies have happened weekly since the mass layoffs first started at the CDC in February. Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderFired workers of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their supporters are pushing for more public health jobs to be restored after a portion of the center’s terminated workforce was reinstated this week. 
Many of the more than 460 workers reinstated are assigned to the National Center for Environmental Health or the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD and Tuberculosis Prevention, according to the Associated Press.
U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to slash 10,000 jobs in late March, including 2,400 jobs at the CDC. 
The reinstated workers received a two-paragraph memorandum Wednesday from Tom Nagy, chief human capital officer with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, that said they were no longer part of the previously announced reduction in force, according to a copy of the memo obtained by the Georgia Recorder. 
“You will not be affected by the upcoming RIF,” the memo says. 
Sarah Boim, a former communication specialist at the CDC who is a leader of the group Fired But Fighting, which describes itself as a coalition of fired CDC employees and allies, said some of the reinstated staffers were already back at work Thursday.
Boim said the restored jobs are not enough, but she said she is skeptical that more people will be brought back since the newly reinstated group represents about 20% of the job losses at the CDC – which would mirror what Kennedy said earlier would need to be reversed because of “mistakes” made by the Department of Government Efficiency. 
Lawsuits challenging the terminations at the CDC and other federal agencies are also working their way through the courts.
Boim said the saga has left laboratory scientists and others sidelined from their work while collecting administrative pay.
“It’s mind boggling — the level of inefficiency and chaos that this whole process has sown,” she said. “I would like people to know that their money was going to pay for people with critical jobs to not do their jobs.”
Georgia Democrats who have pressed for the Trump administration to reverse course on the CDC cuts cheered the news Thursday but pressed for more fired CDC workers to be brought back. 
“The rehiring of hundreds of dedicated health workers, many of whom call Georgia home, is welcome news for those of us who believe that public health is vital to our wellbeing and safety — not a political game,” U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock said in a statement.
Warnock participated in a rally outside the CDC in April. Those rallies have been held every week since the mass layoffs started in February, with one held Tuesday despite the rain after Kennedy fired members of a key vaccine panel. 
“Under Secretary Kennedy’s leadership, the nation’s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,” Emily G. Hilliard, press secretary for the federal agency, said in a statement Thursday. “The Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services—whether it’s supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases.”

(Screenshot from livestream on Sen. Shaheen’s youtube channel)Federal cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development assistance programs will hurt American farmers and the safety of their crops, said several agricultural research leaders at a forum hosted by U.S. Senate Democrats.
“These cuts are clearly problematic for our standing in the world, our leadership in the world, our security, our trade relationships,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. “But it also socks us here at home.”
Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member, hosted a forum to discuss the relationship between foreign assistance programs and the U.S. agriculture market.
Through the Food for Peace program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture facilitates purchases of American crops and partners with non-governmental organizations to distribute these surplus crops to crisis areas around the world. Under the 2026 fiscal year budget request, this program will see major cuts, which may impact American farmers, forum speakers said. Additionally, the reduction of funding to agriculture innovation labs at public universities may leave U.S. crops vulnerable to future diseases.
Cuts to innovation labs may leave U.S. crops unprepared
Dr. David Hughes, director of the USAID Innovation Lab on Current and Emerging Threats to Crops at Penn State University, said funding cuts impact his team’s ability to study potential threats to U.S. agriculture in “safe spaces” around the globe.
His innovation lab, along with the Food Safety Program at Purdue University, the Livestock Systems Program at University of Florida and Peanut Production, a program addressing malnutrition at the University of Georgia, are among the universities that will see cuts under the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.
Hughes said his team members study threats to agriculture overseas, to “quickly deploy” mechanisms against those threats when the time comes. One threat the team is studying is thrips, a small insect that poses a risk to the U.S. floral industry. His team uses a space in Nepal to reduce risk to local crops.
Additionally, Hughes and his team at Penn State have been developing an artificial intelligence system called PlantVillage which provides advice to help farmers cope with climate change to increase the yield and profitability of their crops.
He says many American and European scientists are “decamping” to China because they fill a space of “research excellence” left by cuts to research in the United States.
“You want to make sure if you do have an AI system giving knowledge to American farmers, you better be sure it’s not a made-in-China system.” Hughes said.
Farmers benefit from USDA purchase of surplus
“To be able to count on that institutional market that comes from food assistance is a significant benefit to the U.S. farmer,” said Thoric Cederstrom, International Food Aid representative on the U.S. Dry Bean Council.
Cederstrom said he doesn’t think there is any organization that “stands ready to fill that void,” left by USAID. He argues there is “enlightened self-interest” in the purchase of American crops from farmers to be used as aid abroad. This purchase helps in “stabilizing demand and prices for farmers across the heartland” and “offset the risk of unpredictable market, trade disruptions and climate variability.” The USAID programs create a market that farms can respond to to turn a profit and “generate income that keeps their businesses active.”
Cuts to USDA Inspection Service leave Americans vulnerable to disease
“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” said Kevin Shea, former administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA. “African swine fever in the Dominican Republic, very close to our shores, very easily just one trip away from getting here. That’s just one example. Foot and mouth disease, eradicated a century ago in America, is now appearing all around the world for the first time in many, many years. Another big concern for us. And screwworm has breached the barrier in Panama for many years and has made it into Mexico.”
Shea says that the inspection service has lost nearly 1,300 or around 15% of the workforce has left “in the past few months”  and with the additional cuts under the FY26 budget request “APHIS can not do its job.”
Both Hughes and Shea talked about citrus greening disease, which has impacted the citrus industry in Florida as an example of the need for research and inspection programs.
USAID career staff unable to move current stock to areas in need
Sarah Charles, former assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said despite the cuts, the career staff left at USAID are working “furiously” to move food kept in warehouses around that globe, “even knowing they have been fired,” to areas in need.
She also said the U.S. government response to crises, such as the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, has been “limited” because the capacity has been “taken offline by the Trump administration.”
China showed up in a major capacity, but many of its outreach programs are through the government, so the networks built by the U.S. with non-governmental partners and civil society organizations have been “abandoned,” Charles said.
“Food rations that could supply three and a half million people for a month are rotting in warehouses around the world because of USAID cuts,”  Shaheen said. “Sadly, people are going hungry while farmers are losing a critical buyer for their crops.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Changes outlined in President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill impacting Medicaid expansion, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and taxes could be a $160 million hit to Montana’s state budget, according to an estimate this week from the Legislative Fiscal Division.
Legislative Finance Committee members met this week and, among numerous topics, heard a report from the Legislative Fiscal Division on impacts of federal legislation. A couple of Democrats described the potential reductions as “staggering” and “frightening.”
Trump’s tax cuts would reduce revenue from the taxable income of Montana by $122 million, said Josh Poulette, with the state’s fiscal division.
The changes could mean “either less general fund coming in or more general fund that needs to go out,” Poulette said during the finance committee meeting.
Additionally, if the federal bill was signed into law in its current form, the state would be on the hook for more than $26 million in SNAP benefits if it was to keep the program running as it is now.
Legislators heard the report Tuesday, and at the meeting, the committee discussed potential dates for a special session of the Legislature to address the reductions should one be needed.
Trump’s bill could be signed into law soon. While speaking with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday, U.S. Senator Steve Daines said lawmakers in the Senate are trying to get it on the president’s desk by July 4.
Daines also said the Congressional Budget Office is wrong in its forecast of revenue projections and that the bill will “make some of the largest cuts, true spending cuts, to this runaway spending from the federal government in American history.”
The biggest direct hit to the state’s budget would be the reduction in taxable income. It means the state would have more than $120 million less in its general fund because the law changes deductions.
SNAP would become more expensive because the state would be required to provide a match. The federal government currently pays for the cost of all SNAP benefits.
“This would be tied to the payment error rate of the state. So essentially, the feds do a backward looking error rate calculation for SNAP, and they’ve got historical data on that,” Poulette said during the meeting. “Montana’s error rate has hovered in that 78% range over the years. That would equate to Montana having a 15% match requirement that would come out to a cost of about $26 million additional state funds per year.”
Medicaid expansion, meanwhile, could see 27,000 people dropped. Medicaid covers about 13% of all workers in the state. The Montana Legislature this session approved an extension removing the Medicaid expansion sunset date.
One of the big changes the federal bill makes is increased work requirements to be eligible for benefits. Montana already has this law on the books, but it’s never been enforced, and the Biden Administration did not approve the state’s request to add the stipulation.
Most people on Medicaid expansion already work, and in Montana, the number of people who are enrolled in the program and work is 72%. Another 7% are caretaking, 2% are retired and 10% are acutely ill or disabled and have serious barriers to employment.
Poulette also said there is “essentially a ban” on new taxes on medical providers. Those taxes are often pumped into the Medicaid program, he added. 
Rep. Connie Keogh, a Missoula Democrat and a member of the committee, called the impact to the budget “frightening” during Tuesday’s meeting, while Rep. Paul Tuss, D-Havre, said during the meeting the numbers were “staggering.”
Gov. Greg Gianforte’s office did not respond to a request for comment. However in a recent “Leave Us Alone” podcast episode, the Republican governor did speak on the topic.
“If you believe in limited government, the best way to produce that is to limit the amount of money government collects,” Gianforte said. “Let’s leave it in the people’s pockets.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMG_8965-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

A month ago, state revenues lagged the Idaho Legislature’s projection by $97.7 million, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Now, revenues are running $141.5 million below the Idaho Legislature’s forecast with less than one month remaining in the fiscal year, according to the May Budget and Revenue Monitor report.
Idaho is still projected to finish the 2025 fiscal year on June 30 with a positive ending balance of $278.2 million, according to the May report.
However, that projected ending balance has shrunk from the approximately $420 million ending balance that the Idaho Legislature planned on when the 2025 legislative session adjourned April 4.
 Declining sales tax distribution a driving factor in state’s revenue shortfall

The revenue forecasts and collections are important because the Idaho Legislature built them into the state budget. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30 every year. That means fiscal year 2025 is about to end, and fiscal year 2026 is about to begin.

Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, said the new revenue report shows positive strength in Idaho’s economy despite the missed forecast.
The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, is a powerful legislative committee that sets the budget for every state agency and department. 
Compared to last year, revenue collections are up by $145.3 million, or 2.9%, according to the May report.
“I think this gives us good news about Idaho’s economy,” Horman said in a phone interview Thursday afternoon. “Sometimes when you look at numbers against a forecast, it tells us more about the forecast than the revenue.”
The revenue report shows the sales tax distributions were less than last year and a driving factor in the revenue shortfall. Other revenue sources, including individual income tax collections, corporate income tax and miscellaneous revenues, were all up.
Lori Wolff, administrator of the Idaho Division of Financial Management, also expressed confidence in Idaho’s economy after the revenue report was released Thursday.

“Gov. Little and the Legislature have consistently prioritized responsible budgeting, which has led to Idaho’s tremendous economic success,” Wolff said in a written statement. “We are still seeing year over year growth in revenue, signaling a strong Idaho economy. We have made investments in critical priorities while leaving a $400 million cushion on the bottom line to hedge against revenue softening. Idaho also has 22% of General Fund revenues in rainy day funds, greater than almost every other state. While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”
Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said her heart sank when she read the new revenue report. She said the state will still have enough money to pay for programs in the current year’s budget, but she worries cuts are forthcoming next year.
“I am deeply concerned that all of the tax cuts and the underestimating of revenue will create an on-ramp for my legislative colleagues to easily and unfortunately cut valuable programs and services that Idahoans need,” Wintrow said in a phone interview Thursday. “That is really what I have been dreading this whole time.”
 Tax cuts passed by Idaho Legislature reduce revenue available to the state

During the 2025 legislative session, the Idaho Legislature cut taxes by $400 million and provided an additional $50 million to create a new refundable tax credit for education expenses, including tuition at private, religious schools.
Those actions reduced the amount of state revenue that the state has to spend in its budget by $453 million.  
The role of revenue in the budget is extremely important. The Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget each year where expenses don’t exceed revenues. 
Horman said the newest revenue numbers still demonstrate the Idaho Legislature took a responsible approach to budgeting this year. 
“It makes me especially glad we more than doubled the amount we typically leave on the bottom line when we adjourned sine die because it’s giving us a cushion to adjust to the decline in sales tax revenue,” Horman said, using the Latin term sine die that legislators use when they adjourn the legislative session for the year.
Horman said it will be important to monitor all revenue sources between now and when the Idaho Legislature convenes the 2026 session in January. 
She also said it would be a concern if revenues continued to to fall below the forecast in the coming months and into the forthcoming 2026 fiscal year.
“Looking at the trends with sales tax tells us we made the right decision to have conservative budgeting this year, and we will need to monitor all revenue sources between now and January,” Horman said. “I do anticipate another year of probably even more conservative budgeting (next year) than we saw this year.”
Horman said the Idaho Legislature has invested $7 billion in infrastructure projects like roads, school facilities, water projects, the permanent building fund and more over the past five years. She said the $1.05 to $1.55 per hour pay increases for state employees approved this year represent the largest salary increase in terms of dollars in state history.

But Horman said next year’s budget may be more lean in terms of spending.
“We will need to be cautious about investments we make in the maintenance budgets as well as the budget enhancements moving forward,” Horman said, referencing the new budget procedures where JFAC splits agency budgets into two parts.
Wintrow said she’s worried. 
“I don’t see my colleagues going back on their tax cuts to increase revenue, and my heart sinks wondering about the effects, which are dramatic and potentially harmful,” Wintrow said.

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A “historic” deal made two years ago between the U.S. government, four tribes, Northwest states and environmentalists to put legal battles aside and invest in restoring endangered Columbia River fish runs is now off.
President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum withdrawing the U.S. government from a Dec. 14, 2023, agreement to help restore salmon, steelhead and other native fish being decimated by federal hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin.
The 2023 agreement was reached after decades of legal battles that pitted the federal government against four Lower Columbia River tribes and environmental groups backed by the states of Oregon and Washington.

 Nez Perce Tribe chairman: Salmon extinction is a truth happening now

Groups behind the suits said they would forge on, and legal battles will likely reopen.
“This move by the Trump administration to throw away five years’ worth of progress is shortsighted and reckless,” said Mitch Cutter, a salmon and energy strategist at the Idaho Conservation League, in a statement. “The Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement was a landmark achievement between the federal government, states, Tribes and salmon advocates to find solutions for salmon and stay out of the courtroom. Now, it’s gone thanks to the uninformed impulses of a disconnected administration that doesn’t understand the Pacific Northwest and the rivers and fish that make our region special.”
Electricity demand in Northwest could double in next 20 years, forecast finds

The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the Nez Perce Tribe were part of the deal. In negotiations, the tribes, along with the states of Oregon and Washington, are referred to as the “six sovereigns.”
Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, said in a statement that Trump’s decision is a denial of the truth.
“This action tries to hide from the truth. The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now,” he said. “People across the Northwest know this, and people across the nation have supported us in a vision for preventing salmon extinction that would at the same time create a stronger and better future for the Northwest. This remains the shared vision of the states of Washington and Oregon, and the Yakama, Umatilla, Warm Springs and Nez Perce tribes, as set out in our Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative.”
Groups representing utilities, farmers, ports and others who rely on Columbia River dams for power, moving goods and irrigation, celebrated the executive order.
“As demand for electricity surges across the nation, preserving access to always-available energy resources like hydropower is absolutely crucial,” said Jim Matheson, CEO of the trade group National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, in a news release.
U.S. Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, also applauded Trump’s decision, saying in a Thursday press release that he has long opposed tearing down the dams and that Congress alone has the power to decide their fate. In January, Risch introduced the Northwest Energy Security Act to protect the lower Snake River dams.
“The Biden administration’s one-sided, backroom agreement blatantly disregarded the essential role the lower Snake River dams play and the Idaho communities that rely on them,” Risch said. “Today’s announcement by President Trump represents a return to sound science and common-sense.”
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek’s office could not be reached for comment Thursday afternoon.
 Snake River dams provide irrigation, hydropower, but also contribute to salmon declines

At the heart of the issue are four Snake River dams that provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orcas off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
Fears over Columbia Basin dams, hydroelectricity grow as agencies lose hundreds of employees

Environmental advocates, tribes and others have pushed to remove the four dams – Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite on the Snake River between Kennewick, Washington, and Lewiston, Idaho – to help the fish, including filing lawsuits. Earthjustice, an environmental law group, has led litigation against five federal agencies, seeking changes to dam operations in the Columbia River Basin to help protect salmon.
The 2023 agreement, coupled with Biden-era climate and clean energy funding, was meant to pour more than $1 billion in new federal investments for wild fish restoration into the Columbia River Basin over the next decade, along with clean energy projects on tribal lands. It also included potentially breaching the four Snake River Dams to restore natural flows that could revive native salmon populations.
Earthjustice Attorney Amanda Goodin said in a statement that they would not give up fighting in court to prevent salmon extinction in the Columbia River Basin.
“The Trump administration is turning its back on an unprecedented opportunity to support a thriving Columbia Basin — and ignoring the extinction crisis facing our salmon,” she said. “Unfortunately, this short-sighted decision to renege on this important agreement is just the latest in a series of anti-government and anti-science actions coming from the Trump administration.”

Between 2018 and 2023, the number of applications for H-2A workers increased by 72%, according to a new analysis by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Screenshot taken Nov. 15, 2024, GAO official YouTube channel (Credit: Ben Felder / Investigate Midwest)Every year, hundreds of thousands of foreign workers come to the U.S. to fill temporary agricultural labor shortages through the H-2A program — a system first introduced in 1986 to address shortages in farmwork.
From 2011 to 2024, the use of the program grew more than 400%, with nearly 90% of visas going to workers from Mexico.
But the fastest-growing group is from South Africa – and predominantly white, according to private and federal lawsuits.

While South Africans consist of only 3% of the program, their numbers have climbed by 1,300% according to data from the State Department between 2011 and 2024, and the rate of increase far outpaces any other nationality.
The rapid rise has collided with legal scrutiny.
Since 2022, the Mississippi Center for Justice, a law firm focused on advancing racial and economic justice, has filed seven lawsuits on behalf of Black farmworkers in Mississippi, alleging they were paid less than temporary workers from abroad who were mostly white men from South Africa.

Each of those lawsuits were settled out of court with significant compensation and back pay, according to attorney Rob McDuff, who represented the plaintiffs. The latest case, filed in May, is still pending.
“This is the latest version of an age-old problem in America, in terms of the treatment of Black farmworkers,” McDuff said.
The Department of Labor, under the Biden administration, conducted its own investigation following those initial lawsuits and found 44 additional agricultural employers in Mississippi to be in violation of the H-2A program’s law. By 2023, the department’s Wage and Hour Division had recovered $505,000 in back wages for 161 workers whose rights were violated. Employers were also required to pay an additional $341,838 in civil money penalties.
The South African Chamber of Commerce in the USA, a non-partisan, independent organization and business association, promotes the work program to its citizens. After the lawsuits, the organization worked with the U.S. Ambassador to South Africa to make the H-2A program more inclusive and diverse.
The federal government tracks the country of origin for visa holders, but does not collect data on which businesses hire those workers. Agricultural companies in the southeast host the largest number of H-2A workers in the nation.
Because South Africans speak English and their growing and harvest seasons are the opposite of North America’s, they make attractive candidates.
“You can get any nationality you want in H-2A, and we chose South Africans because their English is better,” Joel Brown, a farmer in Missouri, told Farm Progress. “There are a lot of large farms in South Africa, and some of these guys are coming off those farms.”

Free.,"Judge says Trump takeover of California National Guard 'illegal,' orders return to governor",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-says-trump-takeover-california-national-guard-illegal-orders-return-governor,,"A federal judge in California late Thursday ordered President Donald Trump to relinquish command of 4,000 National Guard troops the president called to help contain Los Angeles protests over immigration raids.U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said Trump’s mobilization of the National Guard was illegal, and ordered the return of control to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had opposed the deployment. He said his order would go into effect noon Pacific time Friday, likely setting up an emergency appeal by the administration.Trump’s “actions were illegal—both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,” Breyer wrote.He issued the 36-page order mere hours after an afternoon hearing at which he appeared skeptical that Trump's order was lawful.Breyer at the hearing appeared not to accept the Trump administration’s argument that obtaining consent from Newsom, a Democrat, was not a prerequisite to federalize the California National Guard.Newsom has been backed up by Democratic attorneys general across the nation in the closely watched case.Breyer noted the law Trump cited when mobilizing the troops requires the order to go through a state’s governor, but Trump’s order bypassed Newsom and went directly to the adjutant general of the California National Guard.“I'm trying to figure out how something is through somebody if, in fact, you didn't give it to him, you actually sent it to the adjutant general,” Breyer said. “It would be the first time I've ever seen something going through somebody if it never went to them directly.”‘A constitutional government and King George’U.S. Justice Department attorney Brett Shumate, who argued for the administration, said Newsom’s approval was not necessary for the commander-in-chief to call National Guard troops into service.“There's no consultation requirement, pre-approval requirement,” he said. “The governor is merely a conduit. He's not a roadblock. The president doesn't have to call up the governor, invite them to Camp David, ‘Let's have a summit, negotiate for a week about what are the terms that we're going to call up the National Guard in your state, what are the terms of the deployment?’”The president alone can determine whether the conditions allowing for the federalization of the National Guard are met, Shumate said.But Breyer, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said the president faced more limits on his authority than Shumate had argued.“That's the difference between a constitutional government and King George,” Breyer said.Nicholas Green, who argued on behalf of the state, called the federal government’s argument “breathtaking in scope,” in part because the troops appear to be assisting in domestic law enforcement.“They are saying, Your Honor, that the president, by fiat, can federalize the National Guard and deploy it in the streets of a civilian city whenever he perceives that there is disobedience to an order,” Green told Breyer. “That is an expansive, dangerous conception of federal executive power.”Breyer seemed less opposed to Trump’s order to deploy 700 U.S. Marines to the area, noting those troops are not yet on the ground in Los Angeles and, as federal troops, were already under Trump’s command without needing to satisfy any other criteria.Breyer’s order Thursday night did not direct any action regarding the Marines.Pause requestedThe judge, who is the brother of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, said he would rule quickly, possibly late Thursday, on California’s request for a restraining order to stop the deployment in Los Angeles.Shuman requested that, if Breyer found in favor of the state, he should pause any restraining order while the federal government appeals.Green said the state would “strongly oppose” such a pause because of the urgency of the situation in Los Angeles.The city has seen days of protests starting on Friday over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on workplaces. Trump ordered the National Guard to the area on Sunday, saying it was necessary to restore order.Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass objected to the decision and have said it has caused more chaos and inflamed tensions.Democrats’ amicus briefThe hearing on California’s request for an injunction came a day after 21 Democratic attorneys general and the Democratic governor of Kansas filed an amicus brief in the case backing up California.Trump wresting control of a state National Guard sets a dangerous precedent that undermines National Guard missions, they said.“National Guard troops fight fires, respond to hurricanes, protect their residents from flooding, and provide much-needed security,” they wrote. “By undermining states’ authority, unlawfully deploying the National Guard troops, and leaving the door wide open to deploy the Guards of every state, the President has made us all less safe. This Court should enjoin the federal government from continuing down this unlawful and perilous path.”In addition to Kansas Gov. Laura Kelley, the attorneys general of Washington, Delaware, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin and Rhode Island signed the brief.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

House Budget Chair Lawrence McClure gave reporters a “yes” when asked if their timeline to finish the work by Monday would work, whereas Senate Budget Chair Ed Hooper answered “maybe.” 
“I think the last two days may be the most productive we’ve had,” Hooper told reporters Thursday evening. Lawmakers voted last week to extend their time to finish the budget until June 18, ahead of the June 30 when the current year’s budget expires.
The budget chairs didn’t meet in public on Wednesday and had only one conference on Tuesday. Hooper said there weren’t enough substantial offers to warrant a meeting on Wednesday. The chambers presented offers on several silos on Thursday evening, such as education, criminal justice, and health care. 
“The president committed to the speaker this afternoon that we are going to do everything in our power to have this thing on the desk sometime tomorrow for a Monday vote,” Hooper said. 
Lawmakers have to wait 72 hours after work on the budget is done to vote on it. 
The Legislature agreed they would spend $50 billion in general revenue before returning to Tallahassee last week. The Legislative leaders have also touted a plan to eliminate taxes on business rent and $350 million in permanent sales tax exemptions. However, the sales tax exemption deal hasn’t been finalized either.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)A five-member majority of the Arkansas Supreme Court granted the state judicial discipline commission’s request for changes to the rules for judges’ and justices’ conduct in a Thursday per curiam order.
The changes concern accusations of judicial misconduct and disciplinary action against judges and justices who face such allegations. The divide among the Supreme Court justices who supported or dissented from the order mirrored conflicts within the court earlier this year. Chief Justice Karen Baker and Associate Justice Courtney Hudson dissented from the order.
Thursday’s order approved two alterations to the Judicial Code of Conduct: a new provision allowing the court to issue interim suspensions of judges accused of crimes or misconduct and an amendment that broadens an existing rule requiring cooperation with disciplinary authorities and prohibiting retaliation.
According to the rule regarding suspensions, the Supreme Court may suspend a judge with pay “upon notice of the filing of an indictment, information, or complaint charging the judge with a ‘serious crime’ under state or federal law.”

In_re_Rule_of_Jud._Disc._Enforcement 
A “serious crime” includes “any felony or lesser crime that reflects adversely on the judge’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a judge in other respects” or any crime involving “interference with the administration of justice, false swearing, misrepresentation, fraud, deceit, bribery, extortion, misappropriation, theft or an attempt, conspiracy or solicitation of another to commit a ‘serious crime,’” the rule states.
The rule is based on a model policy from the American Bar Association, and the Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission specifically asked the high court for the rule, according to the order. The commission investigates complaints about the conduct of judges and justices and has the authority to recommend disciplinary actions.
The rule also allows suspensions for “other misconduct,” which includes but is not limited to “witness intimidation, retaliation, or a threat thereof.”
Another portion of the code of conduct states that a judge “shall cooperate and be candid and honest with judicial and lawyer disciplinary agencies” and must not retaliate “against a person known or suspected to have assisted or cooperated with an investigation” of judicial misconduct.
The amended provision approved by the Supreme Court majority specifies that intimidation is also prohibited and that the rule applies to “a judge, justice, special judge/justice, judicial candidate, or judge-elect.”
Earlier this year, the high court ordered the release of a report alleging that Baker harassed judiciary employees on Dec. 4-5, 2024, after she was elected but before she was sworn in as the state’s first elected female chief justice.
“Justice Baker intimidated staff, appears to have targeted female employees of color, indicated an intention to retaliate based on her perception of how employees voted, and indicated an intention to retaliate based on her perception of whether employees were cooperating with Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission’s investigation into her colleague’s conduct,” the report from the Administrative Office of the Courts human resources department states.

UPDATED: Arkansas Supreme Court chief justice harassed court staff, per human resources report


 Dissent and concurrence

Baker co-signed Hudson’s dissenting opinion on Thursday’s per curiam order. Hudson wrote that the rule regarding suspensions “presents legitimate due-process concerns.”
“It contains absolutely no requirement that notice be provided to the impacted judge either before or after the interim suspension or that the judge be allowed an opportunity to respond to an allegation of misconduct,” Hudson wrote.
She also raised the possibility that the rule violates the state and federal constitutions’ ban on adopting rules or laws that govern conduct prior to their adoption.
Associate Justice Rhonda Wood responded to Hudson’s dissent with a concurring opinion. Wood argued that the new rule creates more due process for judges, not less, because it “provides guidelines previously nonexistent.”
The rule also “sets out parameters for the current authority” that the Supreme Court has always had to suspend judges accused of misconduct and is not a completely new policy applied retroactively, Wood wrote.
Judicial conduct has been at the forefront of the Arkansas Supreme Court since September 2024. Five of Hudson’s colleagues referred her to the JDDC for “flagrant breaches of confidentiality” after she filed then-Chief Justice John Dan Kemp’s emails into evidence in her attempt to block the release of emails between her, Baker and others in response to a FOIA request from Arkansas Business.
Arkansas Supreme Court refers one of its own for disciplinary investigation

Baker dissented to Hudson’s referral to JDDC, and she made transparency a focus of her successful runoff campaign against Wood to succeed Kemp, who did not run for reelection last year.
Within days of taking the oath of office Jan. 1, Baker butted heads with the rest of the court over the scope of her authority as chief justice. Hudson was the only one of Baker’s colleagues who did not block the chief justice’s attempts to fire 10 judiciary employees and appoint three new judges to the judicial discipline body. The other five justices claimed Baker did not have the authority to make such unilateral decisions without consulting the rest of the court.
Issues of judicial misconduct have not been limited to the Supreme Court this year. Former Monroe County district judge and deputy prosecutor T. David Carruth was sentenced in May to two years in federal prison for making false statements to the FBI. He had been admonished by the JDDC in 2018 for improper conduct in violation of the Judicial Code of Ethics.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota lawmakers will not convene to make the call on a new prison site on July 22, according to Gov. Larry Rhoden’s office.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen wrote a letter to Rhoden this week asking that the special session the governor had hoped to call on that date be pushed back. Lawmakers would be asked to back plans for a new prison at that session.
Venhuizen leads the Project Prison Reset group, called into being in February via a Rhoden executive order and charged with deciding if the state needs new prison facilities, how large and where those facilities should be.
Members voted during a Springfield meeting in late April to build a replacement for the South Dakota State Penitentiary, which is located in Sioux Falls.
Pierre played host to the group’s most recent meeting last week, where the group narrowed down locations to Mitchell or Worthing and existing prison campuses in Springfield and Sioux Falls, and voted to cap the cost of such a prison at $600 million. Elected officials in Mitchell including the mayor and sheriff have since come out against locating the prison near their community.
Prison task force rejects original Lincoln County site, tightens budget for new facility

This week, Venhuizen wrote that the group had made “excellent progress,” but that the two weeks between the next Project Prison Reset meeting and the intended special session aren’t enough.
“Even if the task force is able to adopt a specific proposal on July 8, we do not feel that two weeks provides adequate time for a final proposal to be completed with adequate detail, and for state legislators to learn about that proposal prior to the special session,” Venhuizen wrote.
Rhoden, through spokeswoman Josie Harms, said the governor will “accept the task force’s request” and “consult with leadership on a rescheduled date.”
“I’m eager to see what the task force can accomplish in their next meeting,” Rhoden wrote.
The cost of the Rhoden administration’s preferred solution to correctional overcrowding – a 1,500-bed, $825 million facility south of Harrisburg in Lincoln County – was among the primary concerns for the lawmakers who rejected the idea in February.
A consultant hired on behalf of the task force to reevaluate the state’s needs concluded that the state needs more beds than that, 1,700, immediately, to ease current crowding.
A 1,700-bed prison wouldn’t solve the state’s problems long-term, however, according to the consultants. By the mid-2030s, the state would need yet another 1,500-bed prison.
The task force ultimately rejected those conclusions, betting that $600 million would be enough to bulk up the system and replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary complex.
Lawmakers had put back more than $600 million for prison construction before the 2025 legislative session, and the fund had swelled larger than that with interest by winter.
Ongoing construction bills at the site of a new women’s prison in Rapid City – an $87 million project that earned legislative approval – have since come out of that fund, DOC spokesman Michael Winder told Searchlight on Thursday.
The state’s also paid some of the bills associated with site prep at the now-rejected Lincoln County site out of that fund. Lawmakers had approved the spending of up to $60 million in prison design and site prep for a men’s prison in 2024, and the state spent or obligated $52 million of that money for the Lincoln County plan before it came to a halt.

A four-day trial over the district concluded on Thursday afternoon and judges must decide whether the constitutional rights of voters in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties were violated when the Legislature created the Senate district in 2022 that crossed from St. Petersburg over the water to Hillsborough County.
Florida was sued by three voters who are represented by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University School of Law. The plaintiffs allege that the Legislature’s plan to connect Black populations from parts of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties violated their equal-protection rights by unjustifiably packing Black voters into District 16 and removing them from nearby District 18, reducing their influence there.
The defendants, Senate President Ben Albritton and Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, have denied that claim, saying that the maps were lawfully drawn up and previously approved as legally sound by the Florida Supreme Court.
But the defense’s arguments go beyond refuting the plaintiffs’ claims. Indeed the defense went on the offense both before and during the trial to allege that the ACLU of Florida’s lead attorney in the case, Nicholas Warren, worked behind the scenes with Democratic House and Senate staffers to try to get a partisan map approved.

To bolster that argument, attorneys representing the state called Matthew Isbell to the stand (remotely) on Thursday, their last witness.
Isbell is a Tallahassee-based data analyst and consultant who has worked with Democrats and Democratic-affiliated groups over the past decade. Text and direct Twitter messages between Isbell and Warren were displayed to the court showing how both men hoped that the Senate would adopt a map that kept Pinellas County intact and separate from Hillsborough County.
Warren drew his own map that kept the two counties separate and introduced it before the redistricting committee in late 2021, without identifying himself as being a staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida. Sen. Ray Rodrigues, who was chair of the Senate Committee on Reapportionment at the time, subsequently sent a memo to all 40 state senators accusing him of violating Senate rules by not disclosing that he was with the ACLU of Florida.
Warren testified earlier this week that he drew the map on his own personal time and resources, and that the Senate forms that needed to be completed to appear before the committee did not require an individual to list his employer.
Isbell testified on Thursday that he believed that the GOP-majority Legislature’s motivation to split the city of St. Petersburg up was motivated by partisan politics, an allegation that attorneys for the Florida Senate president’s office have strongly refuted.
After Isbell’s video appearance concluded, the closing statements began, starting with the plaintiffs.
 “Race predominated”

Warren declared that “race predominated in the drawing of the district.”
In terms of direct evidence to back up that statement, Warren played a video clip from a November 2021 committee hearing. The excerpt shows Orange County Democratic Sen. Randolph Bracy asked Senate Committee on Reapportionment staff director Jay Ferrin why the newly proposed Senate District 16 district had to cross from St. Petersburg over into Tampa Bay and Hillsborough County.

Ferrin replied that it was to comply with the Fair Districts amendment in the Florida Constitution, specifically the “Tier 1” standards which provide protections for racial and language minorities. Bracy then asked Ferrin if there was a way to configure the district to comply with the Fair Districts amendment and still keep the two countries separate. 
Another video exchange showed Pasco County Republican Danny Burgess,telling Bracy that Senate “staff” had said keeping the counties separate wasn’t possible, because it would lead to a “significant number of voters who would be disenfranchised.” At the time  Burgess was the chair of another Senate committee that also dealt with reapportionment.
Ferrin agreed with Burgess, saying it would result in a“wide diminishment” that would ultimately disenfranchise Black voters in Pinellas County.
Bracy followed up asking how much the Black vote would be diminished by if the counties were to remain separate. Ferrin replied “close to 30%,”and added that such a reduction “would constitute diminishment.”
That comment, Warren said in his closing, revealed that race placed a major role in why Senate District 16 was created.
 Failing to make the case?

The defense came back with closing statements from the two attorneys representing their side: Daniel Nordby, who was representing Ben Albritton in his official capacity as president of the Florida Senate, and Mohammad Jazil, who was representing Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd.
Nordby said the plaintiffs had to prove that race was a predominant factor in the creation of Senate District 16, but that they fell short.
“Plaintiffs have not come close to doing so,” Nordby said.
He emphasized how Ferrin had recognized the constitutional requirements for drawing up districts – which is that districts should be compact, and when possible, utilize existing political and geographic boundaries. 
Ferrin did, Nordby said, noting that Ferrin used important boundaries such as I-275, the Hillsborough River, and 22nd Avenue North in St. Petersburg, a major artery, when configuring the Senate district.
Nordby acknowledged that race was a consideration, because “it had to be,” noting that to ignore that would be ignoring part of the state constitution.
Nordby also dismissed the three alternative maps drawn up for the plaintiffs by Pennsylvania State University professor of statistics Cory McCartan that keep Hillsborough and Pinellas counties separate. 
And he then addressed the peculiar situation regarding Warren, saying, “This case is an odd one.”
Nordby asserted Warren had essentially “laundered” his map through the alternative presented during the trial by McCartan. He also questioned why none of the lawmakers that plaintiff attorneys had indicated could be witnesses in the case – Sen. Darryl Rouson, House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell and most notably former Bracy, the “alleged lynchpin” for the plaintiff’s case, never showed up.
Bracy was a scheduled witness but failed to appear earlier in the week, much to the disappointment of the ACLU attorneys. When contacted by phone on Tuesday by a representative from the three-judge panel, Bracy said he hadn’t seen the subpoena until that very day and said that he had already told plaintiff attorneys that he did not intend to show up. Burgess and Rodrigues cited legislative privilege in declining to appear, according to the court.
Representing Byrd,Jazil said all of the proposed Senate maps that the ACLU had presented during the trial were examples of partisan and racial gerrymandering, and cited his text messages to House and Senate staffers involved with the reapportionment process.
  A ‘contrived kerfuffle’

In response to their closing arguments  meanwhile, Daniel Tilley, another attorney with the ACLU of Florida, noted how no lawmaker had testified. Tilley said all of the attention focused on Warren was a “contrived kerfuffle” that found no evidence to support the idea that members of the Senate were influenced by his map. It was, he surmised, a “spectacular failure.”
During the four-day trial there were hours of detailed descriptions by experts that dealt with how to draw legislative districts that were logically configured and not oddly shaped.
The Florida Senate District 16 seat is held by Rouson, who resides in St. Petersburg. Several Tampa-based constituents in the district complained earlier in the trial that he was not as accessible to meet in Hillsborough County, though defense attorneys said he has district offices in the county in Tampa and Brandon.
The three-judge panel that will decide the case includes two of them who are Trump appointees.  The panel was led by Andrew L. Brasher, who serves in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Accompanying him was U.S. Senior District Judge Charlene Edwards Honeywell and U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Barber, both of whom serve on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. Brasher and Barber were appointed by Trump during his first term as president in 2019.
If they rule in favor of the plaintiffs, their hope would be that the Florida Senate could create and approve a new map of the district in time for the 2026 election.

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” wrote Trump, who owns a number of hotels in the U.S., including one in Las Vegas. 
“It’s a very simple thing to say, ‘we’re going to secure the border and we’re going to deport violent criminals and terrorists.’ Everybody agrees with that,” Culinary Local 226 Secretary-Treasurer Ted Pappageorge said during a phone interview Thursday. “When you bring in the Marines to arrest dishwashers, that backlash is exploding in industry, among citizens and voters. If there’s one thing this president knows how to do it’s to backtrack quickly when he gets a backlash.” 
The U.S. employed more than 782,000 farm workers in 2023, according to the government. About two-thirds are immigrants, according to the government. 
The leisure and hospitality industries in the U.S. employ some 14 million people, and almost one-third are immigrants, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.
Nevada’s hospitality and leisure industries employed 368,400 people as of April, according to the Federal Reserve. 
“These industries are run by very smart people, and they understand that the immigrant workforce powers this economy,” said Pappageorge.  
Pappageorge said he’s not bothered by a carve-out from the deportation policy for two industries, suggesting agriculture and hospitality are just the first two to the table. 
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who endorsed Trump and was endorsed by Trump, did not respond to inquiries about whether he’s reached out to the White House regarding the president’s deportation plan and disruption to the labor force. 
The Nevada Resort Association, which represents casino hotels in Nevada, referred the Current to the American Hotel and Lodging Association. 
“Along with our members, we continue to communicate with Congress and the administration about the importance of building a strong hospitality and tourism workforce,” the AHLA, which represents 32,000 properties, said in a statement. “As an industry, we are committed to strict compliance with labor laws and immigration regulations, including those focused on recruitment, background checks and employment verification.”
The hospitality industry is already reeling from a precipitous drop in travel resulting from Trump’s trade wars, Bloomberg reported last week. 
“The AHLA urges Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and strengthen the H-2B visa program, which allows temporary non-agricultural work in the U.S., and the J-1 visa program, which allows participation in exchange programs,” says the AHLA website. “We believe that the United States can have both an effective and welcoming legal immigration process that enables hotels and other businesses to meet our workforce needs, while also protecting our national security.”
How Trump plans to exclude workers from the two industries from deportation is unknown. 
“They could do this by prosecutorial discretion possibly,” said Michael Kagan, director of UNLV’s Immigration Clinic. Immigrations and Customer Enforcement (ICE) has the option to close cases and allow individuals to avoid deportation.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/trump-las-vegas-hotel-jen-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Free.,‘Sanctuary city’ governors object to Trump deployment of troops into Los Angeles,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/sanctuary-city-governors-object-trump-deployment-troops-los-angeles,,"WASHINGTON — Three Democratic governors from states that leave immigration enforcement to the federal government said Thursday they oppose President Donald Trump’s decision to send more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines into Los Angeles without the consent of California Gov. Gavin Newsom.The lengthy and tense U.S. House hearing where the trio appeared — highlighted by a shouting match among members and accusations of Nazi tactics — came as the nation’s capital prepared for a major military parade and Trump’s birthday Saturday, along with thousands of “No Kings” protests across the country.In Los Angeles, a U.S. senator was tackled and removed from an immigration press conference by federal law enforcement agents accompanying Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.The governors, whose states have submitted an amicus brief to a lawsuit by Newsom challenging Trump, said the decisions to bring in the military should be made by local officials.“It's wrong to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines into an American city over the objection of local law enforcement, just to inflame a situation and create a crisis, just as it's wrong to tear children away from their homes and their mothers and fathers, who have spent decades living and working in our communities, raising their families,” Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois told members of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee.The hearing with Govs. Pritzker, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Kathy Hochul of New York marked the second time House Republicans have called in leaders in blue states that have policies of non-cooperation with federal immigration officials in enforcement efforts. Those policies do not bar immigration enforcement from occurring.Republicans brought in the mayors of Boston, Chicago and Denver in March.The eight-hour hearing came after multi-day protests in Los Angeles sparked when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began widespread immigration raids at Home Depots in their communities in an effort to carry out the president’s mass deportation efforts.The governors stressed that the president’s decision to send in the National Guard set a dangerous precedent and posed a threat to democracy.Republicans on the committee defended the president’s actions and instead accused the governors of violating federal law because of their state policies, dubbed as “sanctuary cities.” Immigration policy is handled by the federal government and states and localities are not required to coordinate with officials.Shouting match over NoemMore than four hours into the hearing, video circulated of California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla being forcibly removed and handcuffed by Secret Service agents while trying to ask a question of Noem during a press conference in LA.Democrats on the panel, such as Arizona Democratic Rep. Yassamin Ansari, slammed the video and raised concerns that a “sitting senator was shoved to the ground.”It led to a shouting match, with Florida Democratic Rep. Maxwell Alejandro Frost asking the chair of the panel, James Comer of Kentucky, if the committee would subpoena Noem.Comer said Frost was out of order and tried to move on.Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was next in line for questioning, heckled Frost and said that Democrats “can’t follow the rules.” Comer eventually told Frost to “shut up.”Pritzker said that he could not “believe the disrespect that was shown to a United States senator” who was trying to ask Noem a question.“That seems completely irrational,” Pritzker said.Democrats on the panel such as Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez and Dan Goldman of New York called for Noem to appear before the committee.“Anyone with two eyes that can see, can see that was authoritarian, lawless behavior that no person in America, much less a senator conducting congressional oversight, should receive,” Goldman said.‘People are living in fear’The Democratic governors defended their immigration policies and criticized the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown, pointing to ICE officers wearing face coverings to arrest immigrants.“People are living in fear in the shadows,” Hochul said. “People can't go to school, they can't worship, they can't go get health care. They can't go to their senior center. What is happening has been traumatic.”Several Republicans including Reps. Comer, Tom Emmer of Minnesota and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, took issue with comments by Walz at a commencement speech in May, in which he accused the president of turning ICE agents into a modern-day Gestapo, the official secret police of Nazi Germany.Republican Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri said that Walz should apologize.Walz said that as a former history teacher, he was making an observation about ICE tactics — such as wearing a face covering to arrest people — that were similar to those used by secret police.The top Democrat on the panel, Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, defended Walz’s statement, and said that ICE is operating like a modern-day Gestapo.Lynch pointed to the video of the international Tufts University student who was approached by masked men on the street and taken into a van for writing an op-ed in defense of Palestinian human rights.  “ICE agents wearing masks and hoodies detained Rümeysa Öztürk and those of you who watched that, that abduction, when you compare the old films of the Gestapo grabbing people off the streets of Poland, and you compare them to those nondescript thugs who grabbed that student, that graduate student, it does look like a Gestapo operation,” Lynch said.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a $1 billion dollar geothermal energy generation site anticipated within the next three years. (Screengrab from live stream ) Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday announced what she described as a “big damn deal” for green energy production in New Mexico, one that she said will provide Meta’s New Mexico data centers with huge amounts of green energy they need without using much water or costing taxpayers a dime. 
At a news conference at the Roundhouse, surrounded by cabinet agency heads and leaders from the Silicon Valley giant and also XGS Energy, the governor said the deal means XGS Energy would produce 150 megawatts of energy for Meta through its “advanced geothermal technology.” 
Geothermal energy taps into heat under the Earth’s surface to generate electricity using steam turbines or further uses for heating and cooling. Leaders touted the “advanced” version of that technology as a way to minimize water usage through a “closed-loop” system and also by using a tiny surface footprint, claiming only 15 acres is needed on the surface for a project that produces enough energy to power 50,000 homes. 

Read the report here. 

In addition to the energy production, the new geothermal plant will mean a $1 billion private sector investment that will create 3,000 construction jobs and 100 “really good” jobs running the geothermal power plant, the governor said. 
It’s not clear when the company will break ground on the plant or plants or where they will be located. Company leaders described at least a three-year permitting timeline. 
The governor and XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico has the exact right geology to greatly expand geothermal projects. A 238-page academic report released Thursday claims the state has enough capacity to produce 163 gigawatts of geothermal power, which the report authors say is more than 15 times the amount of capacity the state had in 2023. 
  XGS Energy CEO Josh Prueher said New Mexico’s favorable geology and permitting landscape makes it “asy and inviting” for developers and investors, he said at a press conference Tuesday, June 12, 2025. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)
Combine the right geology with what Prueher called an easy permitting process, and then add in   an oil and gas workforce that could be trained to work in geothermal technology, and you’ve got an environment that’s “easy and inviting for developers and investors” he said. 
The governor said the state helped the deal come together through years of policy and legislative work, but stressed that no taxpayer money would be spent on it. She also said there isn’t any state agency rulemaking required or legislation that will need to pass at the upcoming legislative session. 
“This is born from all the groundwork all of us have been laying in the state, which is why, frankly, it’s a great announcement jointly, and it should be a bit of a celebration,” she said. 
The governor’s proposal is the latest she’s offered that seeks to enable continued growth while confronting the state’s arid climate, diminishing water supply and reliance on the oil and gas industry. In 2024, she announced a push for a so-called Strategic Water Supply that sought to create a market for wastewater produced by oil and gas drilling, along with brackish water. 
The state’s 50-year water plan released last year says the state can expect a 25% reduction in its water supply over the next 50 years, thanks to climate change-caused aridification. 
While leaders were tight-lipped about where the projects could go, they said the public is welcome to weigh in via the permitting process.

In a presentation elsewhere in Santa Fe as part of the release of the academic report, Melanie Kenderdine, secretary of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, showed a map that suggested the sites could be in Sandoval, San Miguel, Doña Ana, Catron and Hidalgo counties, and listed an additional 13 other counties that have “most favorable potential for other sites.”
The state aims to move forward with further projects, Kenderdine told attendees at a conference hosted by Project InnerSpace, a nonprofit pushing for further geothermal projects. 
The state has competing needs for the space underground beyond geothermal, Kenderdine said, such as sequestering carbon underground or developing geologic hydrogen as another fuel source. 
“We need to do very, very detailed mapping of the New Mexico subsurface and we need to do it quickly,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/screenshot_2025-06-12_at_4.14.18___pm_720.png,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

“These cuts are clearly problematic for our standing in the world, our leadership in the world, our security, our trade relationships,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. “But it also socks us here at home.”
Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senate Agriculture Committee ranking member and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member, hosted a forum to discuss the relationship between foreign assistance programs and the U.S. agriculture market.

Through the Food for Peace program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture facilitates purchases of American crops and partners with non-governmental organizations to distribute these surplus crops to crisis areas around the world. Under the 2026 fiscal year budget request, this program will see major cuts, which may impact American farmers, forum speakers said. Additionally, the reduction of funding to agriculture innovation labs at public universities may leave U.S. crops vulnerable to future diseases.
Cuts to innovation labs may leave U.S. crops unprepared
Dr. David Hughes, director of the USAID Innovation Lab on Current and Emerging Threats to Crops at Penn State University, said funding cuts impact his team’s ability to study potential threats to U.S. agriculture in “safe spaces” around the globe.
His innovation lab, along with the Food Safety Program at Purdue University, the Livestock Systems Program at University of Florida and Peanut Production, a program addressing malnutrition at the University of Georgia, are among the universities that will see cuts under the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.
Hughes said his team members study threats to agriculture overseas, to “quickly deploy” mechanisms against those threats when the time comes. One threat the team is studying is thrips, a small insect that poses a risk to the U.S. floral industry. His team uses a space in Nepal to reduce risk to local crops.
Additionally, Hughes and his team at Penn State have been developing an artificial intelligence system called PlantVillage which provides advice to help farmers cope with climate change to increase the yield and profitability of their crops.
He says many American and European scientists are “decamping” to China because they fill a space of “research excellence” left by cuts to research in the United States.
“You want to make sure if you do have an AI system giving knowledge to American farmers, you better be sure it’s not a made-in-China system.” Hughes said.
Farmers benefit from USDA purchase of surplus
“To be able to count on that institutional market that comes from food assistance is a significant benefit to the U.S. farmer,” said Thoric Cederstrom, International Food Aid representative on the U.S. Dry Bean Council.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Cederstrom said he doesn’t think there is any organization that “stands ready to fill that void,” left by USAID. He argues there is “enlightened self-interest” in the purchase of American crops from farmers to be used as aid abroad. This purchase helps in “stabilizing demand and prices for farmers across the heartland” and “offset the risk of unpredictable market, trade disruptions and climate variability.” The USAID programs create a market that farms can respond to to turn a profit and “generate income that keeps their businesses active.”
Cuts to USDA Inspection Service leave Americans vulnerable to disease
“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” said Kevin Shea, former administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA. “African swine fever in the Dominican Republic, very close to our shores, very easily just one trip away from getting here. That’s just one example. Foot and mouth disease, eradicated a century ago in America, is now appearing all around the world for the first time in many, many years. Another big concern for us. And screwworm has breached the barrier in Panama for many years and has made it into Mexico.”
Shea says that the inspection service has lost nearly 1,300 or around 15% of the workforce has left “in the past few months”  and with the additional cuts under the FY26 budget request “APHIS can not do its job.”
Both Hughes and Shea talked about citrus greening disease, which has impacted the citrus industry in Florida as an example of the need for research and inspection programs.
USAID career staff unable to move current stock to areas in need
Sarah Charles, former assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said despite the cuts, the career staff left at USAID are working “furiously” to move food kept in warehouses around that globe, “even knowing they have been fired,” to areas in need.
She also said the U.S. government response to crises, such as the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, has been “limited” because the capacity has been “taken offline by the Trump administration.”
China showed up in a major capacity, but many of its outreach programs are through the government, so the networks built by the U.S. with non-governmental partners and civil society organizations have been “abandoned,” Charles said.
“Food rations that could supply three and a half million people for a month are rotting in warehouses around the world because of USAID cuts,”  Shaheen said. “Sadly, people are going hungry while farmers are losing a critical buyer for their crops.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Families and educators at Epic Charter School now face a summer of uncertainty as the charter school system downsizes its staff, facilities and course offerings.
A leadership change and a state investigation have piled on top of the cuts. The virtual charter school’s superintendent, Bart Banfield, resigned Monday, days after Epic laid off 357 teachers and administrators. Its deputy superintendent of finance, Jeanise Wynn, resigned April 11.
“There hasn’t been much transparency about why and what are we doing,” Epic teacher and parent Sarah Kitterman said. “What actions are we taking to make sure this changes and we don’t do this again?”
Kitterman, of Edmond, said Epic lost programs that were difference-makers for students. Her own children benefited from a now-eliminated ELA+ program that offered bonus reading classes. 
Students won’t get that extra English language arts instruction without the program, she said, and it’s unclear how Epic will repeat the “incredible” learning gains that ELA+ produced. A similar Math+ program has been reduced to grades 6-12 only.

The closure of Epic’s Blended Learning Centers is a loss, too, Kitterman said. The centers, which offered in-person instruction in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, often had waiting lists.
Students with disabilities especially sought a place at the learning centers, said Kitterman, a special education teacher.
“Does that mean that we’re going to have an overload of students on our rosters now?” she said. “We can’t serve those students the same way that they were being served. So where do those students go?”
Epic announced it would give students from the learning centers priority in another face-to-face instructional option, Comet Academy.
Also gone are Epic’s options for full-time in-person instruction five days a week, its school meal services, and all of its Chinese and Latin courses. Other services, like Advanced Placement courses, have been outsourced to other entities, some now costing a fee.
“These changes are part of our ongoing reorganization to better serve the 30,000 students statewide who choose Epic for their education, and to position the state’s largest public virtual charter school for strength and success in the years to come,” the school told families in an email last week.

Members of Epic’s school board spoke little of the school’s financial situation Thursday in their first meeting since the layoffs and Banfield’s departure. The board, which is scheduled to meet again Tuesday, approved a new treasurer, assistant treasurer and encumbrance clerk for Epic, who will join the new chief financial officer, Michael Flory.
The school board has yet to approve a budget for the 2025-26 school year, which must be done before the next fiscal year begins on July 1. 
The Statewide Charter School Board, a state agency that oversees Epic, is now investigating the school’s finances.
After its enrollment skyrocketed to over 60,000 children in 2020, Epic has steadily lost students and, as a result, state funding. An influx of federal pandemic aid funds also came to an end in September.
To make matters worse, Epic administrators significantly miscalculated when crafting their budget for the 2024-25 academic year. Enrollment came in 4,000 students short of what administrators expected, prompting a round of layoffs in October that cost 144 jobs.
The cuts continued this month when Epic slashed 83 teaching positions and 274 administrators.
Banfield soon followed out the door.
“At Epic, we often say, ‘The only constant is change,’” Banfield wrote in his resignation letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained. “Over the course of this school year, it has become clear to me that it is time for a new chapter. With deep gratitude, I am formally submitting my resignation. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Board of Education, the Epic staff, and most importantly, the hundreds of thousands of families who have chosen Epic as their school of choice since 2011. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve you over the past 11 years. I wish you the very best. Go Comets!”
Deputy Superintendent of Instruction Justin Hunt will serve as interim superintendent while the board searches for a candidate to hire permanently.

“I appreciate the trust and respect, and (I’m) looking forward to moving into next school year for the 30,000 kids that need us and choose us as a school option,” Hunt said during Thursday’s school board meeting.
As for Kitterman, she plans to return for her fourth school year teaching at Epic, and her three children will continue to attend, she said. Until this point, Kitterman has felt like a valued employee, she said, but the lack of transparency around the layoffs and cuts put that sense of value in doubt.
“I plan to stay as long as Epic is open,” Kitterman said. “We’ve loved it, so that’s my hope. It’s just so scary.”

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)A “historic” deal made two years ago between the U.S. government, four tribes, Northwest states and environmentalists to put legal battles aside and invest in restoring endangered Columbia River fish runs is now off.
President Donald Trump on Thursday signed a presidential memorandum withdrawing the U.S. government from a Dec. 14, 2023 agreement to help restore salmon, steelhead and other native fish being decimated by federal hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin. The memorandum refers to  the commitments as “onerous,” “misguided” and as placing “concerns about climate change above the nation’s interests in reliable energy resources.”
The 2023 agreement was reached after decades of legal battles that pitted the federal government against four Lower Columbia River tribes and environmental groups backed by the states of Oregon and Washington.
Groups behind the suits said they would forge on, and legal battles will likely reopen.
“This move by the Trump administration to throw away five years’ worth of progress is shortsighted and reckless,” said Mitch Cutter, a salmon and energy strategist at the Idaho Conservation League, in a statement. “The Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement was a landmark achievement between the federal government, states, Tribes and salmon advocates to find solutions for salmon and stay out of the courtroom. Now, it’s gone thanks to the uninformed impulses of a disconnected administration that doesn’t understand the Pacific Northwest and the rivers and fish that make our region special.”
The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon and the Nez Perce Tribe were part of the deal. In negotiations, the tribes, along with the states of Oregon and Washington, are referred to as the “six sovereigns.”
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek’s office.
Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, said in a statement that Trump’s decision is a denial of the truth.
“This action tries to hide from the truth. The Nez Perce Tribe holds a duty to speak the truth for the salmon, and the truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now,” he said. “People across the Northwest know this, and people across the nation have supported us in a vision for preventing salmon extinction that would at the same time create a stronger and better future for the Northwest. This remains the shared vision of the states of Washington and Oregon, and the Yakama, Umatilla, Warm Springs and Nez Perce tribes, as set out in our Columbia Basin Restoration Initiative.”
Groups representing utilities, farmers, ports and others who rely on Columbia River dams for power, moving goods and irrigation, celebrated the executive order.
“As demand for electricity surges across the nation, preserving access to always-available energy resources like hydropower is absolutely crucial,” said Jim Matheson, CEO of the trade group National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, in a news release.
Reaction from Washington’s congressional delegation split along partisan lines.
U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican who represents central Washington, applauded Trump’s move, saying it “reverses the efforts by the Biden administration and extreme environmental activists to remove the dams, which would have threatened the reliability of our power grid, raised energy prices, and decimated our ability to export grain to foreign markets.”
Washington U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, called the president’s action “grievously wrong” and shortsighted.
“This was a once-in-a-generation opportunity to modernize infrastructure across the Columbia River Basin, support reliable clean energy, and save imperiled salmon and steelhead runs,” Murray said in a statement. “The Trump administration’s senseless decision to tear it up is a betrayal of our Tribes and a tremendous setback for the entire Northwest.”
 Nearing extinction

At the heart of the issue are four Snake River dams that provide irrigation and emissions-free hydropower for nearby communities, but have also contributed to the near extinction of 13 salmon and steelhead populations that return to the Columbia Basin from the Pacific Ocean to spawn. The fish are important to tribal health and sovereignty and to basin ecosystems, and the declines are hitting southern resident orcas off the coasts of British Columbia, Washington and Oregon that rely on salmon for food and that are federally listed as endangered.
Environmental advocates, tribes and others have pushed to remove the four dams – Ice Harbor, Lower Monumental, Little Goose and Lower Granite on the Snake River between Kennewick, Wash., and Lewiston, Idaho – to help the fish, including filing lawsuits. Earthjustice, an environmental law group, has led litigation against five federal agencies, seeking changes to dam operations in the Columbia River Basin to help protect salmon.
The 2023 agreement, coupled with Biden-era climate and clean energy funding, was meant to pour more than $1 billion in new federal investments for wild fish restoration into the Columbia River Basin over the next decade, along with clean energy projects on tribal lands. It also included potentially breaching the four Snake River Dams to restore natural flows that could revive native salmon populations.
Earthjustice Attorney Amanda Goodin said in a statement that they would not give up fighting in court to prevent salmon extinction in the Columbia River Basin.
“The Trump administration is turning its back on an unprecedented opportunity to support a thriving Columbia Basin — and ignoring the extinction crisis facing our salmon,” she said. “Unfortunately, this short-sighted decision to renege on this important agreement is just the latest in a series of anti-government and anti-science actions coming from the Trump administration.”
Correction: a previous version of the story incorrectly said Trump’s presidential memorandum also revoked another September 2023 presidential memorandum signed by former President Joe Biden meant to send Northwest tribes funding for salmon reintroduction.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Appreciation for South County’s acclaimed Matunuck Oyster Bar transcends political party, evidenced by the Rhode Island General Assembly’s universal support to change state outdoor dining regulations on the restaurant’s behalf.
Companion bills sponsored by South Kingstown Democrats, Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee and Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski were each approved by their respective chambers in separate, unanimous votes Thursday. 
Each chamber must still give the rubber stamp to the other’s bill — a process known as concurrence — before the legislation heads to Gov. Dan McKee’s desk. McKee has already indicated his support.
The eleventh hour proposal, introduced in the Rhode Island State House one week earlier, offers a temporary solution after a fire permanently closed Matunuck Oyster Bar on May 20.
Perry Raso, restaurant owner and oyster farmer, has cooked up a plan to host diners in a neighboring marina parking lot this summer, which requires a few tweaks to existing state regulations governing al fresco eateries.
“While we know summer at Matunuck Oyster Bar won’t look the same this year, this creative solution is a great first step toward welcoming diners back to our tables and keeping our staff working and earning wages during this busy season,” Raso said in a statement Thursday prior to the votes.
Raso said he can keep about 50 members of his 300-person staff on the payroll this summer under the mobile kitchen plan.

“This bill is not only about outdoor dining, it’s about protecting jobs, supporting small business and keeping our economy going,” said Rep. Kathleen Fogarty, a South Kingstown Democrat whose district includes the restaurant and Raso’s home.
Outdoor dining is no longer a novelty, having become a staple for the state’s hospitality industry in the wake of the pandemic. In February 2024, lawmakers approved a new state law regulating outdoor dining, allowing cities and towns to limit outdoor dining on public property and set capacity caps, while protecting restaurant owners from overly restrictive local limits on operating hours and parking.
The bill passed by both chambers Thursday amends the 2024 law, permitting 18 months of outdoor dining — or until the building is “fit for occupancy” — for restaurants closed due to casualties like floods and fires. Municipal governments would also need to OK the workaround measure for affected restaurants in their communities based on existing local ordinances. Restaurants could serve alcohol outside, too, if they already have a local liquor license.
The added flexibility for outdoor dining in emergencies expires June 30, 2027, though Senator Leonidas Raptakis, a Coventry Democrat, urged fellow senators to consider making the change permanent.  
“I think this is a very good tool that helps all businesses in Rhode Island,” Raptakis, who used to own Venus Pizza in Coventry. “I don’t want to see this happen to any business.”
Across the rotunda, Minority Whip David Place,a Burrillville Republican, lobbied unsuccessfully to make the proposal permanent.
 “I don’t want this to just be here for one business, I want it to be here for every business,” Place said.
McEntee, however, said the sunset provision aligned with prior, pandemic-era outdoor dining laws, which all began as temporary measures and, if proven effective, became permanent.
Place ultimately voted for the legislation as presented, including the 2027 expiration.
The South Kingstown Town Council passed a resolution at its June 9 meeting supporting the state policy change, as requested by Elizabeth Noonan, an attorney representing Raso. 
The South Kingstown Town Council must also approve details of Raso’s outdoor dining plans, which had not been submitted to the town as of Thursday afternoon, Town Council President Rory McEntee. He is the son of Rep. McEntee.
“We look forward to sharing our plans for al fresco dining in the marina parking lot across the street from the Matunuck Oyster Bar if and when this legislation is enacted, and we remain committed to take any step we can to preserve as many summer shifts for as many of our employees as possible,” Raso said Thursday.
Details on a permanent rebuild and reopening of the famed, 16-year seafood restaurant were not immediately available.
The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal, Matt Touchette, a spokesperson, said Thursday. A preliminary investigation suggested it was accidental, and not caused by commercial cooking equipment.
Rep. Megan Cotter, an Exeter Democrat, recused herself from the vote. Cotter sold the restaurant fish through her job as director of business development and category management for Foley Fish, she said via text Thursday night.

Through the Food for Peace program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture facilitates purchases of American crops and partners with non-governmental organizations to distribute these surplus crops to crisis areas around the world. Under the 2026 fiscal year budget request, this program will see major cuts, which may impact American farmers, forum speakers said. Additionally, the reduction of funding to agriculture innovation labs at public universities may leave U.S. crops vulnerable to future diseases.
Cuts to innovation labs may leave U.S. crops unprepared
Dr. David Hughes, director of the USAID Innovation Lab on Current and Emerging Threats to Crops at Penn State University, said funding cuts impact his team’s ability to study potential threats to U.S. agriculture in “safe spaces” around the globe.
His innovation lab, along with the Food Safety Program at Purdue University, the Livestock Systems Program at University of Florida and Peanut Production, a program addressing malnutrition at the University of Georgia, are among the universities that will see cuts under the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE.
Hughes said his team members study threats to agriculture overseas, to “quickly deploy” mechanisms against those threats when the time comes. One threat the team is studying is thrips, a small insect that poses a risk to the U.S. floral industry. His team uses a space in Nepal to reduce risk to local crops. 
Additionally, Hughes and his team at Penn State have been developing an artificial intelligence system called PlantVillage which provides advice to help farmers cope with climate change to increase the yield and profitability of their crops. 
He says many American and European scientists are “decamping” to China because they fill a space of “research excellence” left by cuts to research in the United States. 
“You want to make sure if you do have an AI system giving knowledge to American farmers, you better be sure it’s not a made-in-China system.” Hughes said. 
Farmers benefit from USDA purchase of surplus
“To be able to count on that institutional market that comes from food assistance is a significant benefit to the U.S. farmer,” said Thoric Cederstrom, International Food Aid representative on the U.S. Dry Bean Council. 
Cederstrom said he doesn’t think there is any organization that “stands ready to fill that void,” left by USAID. He argues there is “enlightened self-interest” in the purchase of American crops from farmers to be used as aid abroad. This purchase helps in “stabilizing demand and prices for farmers across the heartland” and “offset the risk of unpredictable market, trade disruptions and climate variability.” The USAID programs create a market that farms can respond to to turn a profit and “generate income that keeps their businesses active.” 
Cuts to USDA Inspection Service leave Americans vulnerable to disease
“There couldn’t be a worse time to lower our guard,” said Kevin Shea, former administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at USDA. “African swine fever in the Dominican Republic, very close to our shores, very easily just one trip away from getting here. That’s just one example. Foot and mouth disease, eradicated a century ago in America, is now appearing all around the world for the first time in many, many years. Another big concern for us. And screwworm has breached the barrier in Panama for many years and has made it into Mexico.” 
Shea says that the inspection service has lost nearly 1,300 or around 15% of the workforce has left “in the past few months”  and with the additional cuts under the FY26 budget request “APHIS can not do its job.”
Both Hughes and Shea talked about citrus greening disease, which has impacted the citrus industry in Florida as an example of the need for research and inspection programs. 
USAID career staff unable to move current stock to areas in need
Sarah Charles, former assistant to the administrator of USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, said despite the cuts, the career staff left at USAID are working “furiously” to move food kept in warehouses around that globe, “even knowing they have been fired,” to areas in need. 
She also said the U.S. government response to crises, such as the 2025 Myanmar earthquake, has been “limited” because the capacity has been “taken offline by the Trump administration.” 
China showed up in a major capacity, but many of its outreach programs are through the government, so the networks built by the U.S. with non-governmental partners and civil society organizations have been “abandoned,” Charles said.
“Food rations that could supply three and a half million people for a month are rotting in warehouses around the world because of USAID cuts,”  Shaheen said. “Sadly, people are going hungry while farmers are losing a critical buyer for their crops.”

“I would love to encourage our producers of our spirits to get their products, get what they need, their supplies here in the state. Let’s encourage it,” said Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington). 
The Jersey Fresh program began in the 1980s to inform consumers about produce grown in the state and promote buying from local businesses. In order for farmers to use a Jersey Fresh logo, they must show they meet U.S. Department of Agriculture standards and the USDA can conduct regular inspections. 
Under the bill, a beverage should be made with at least 51% of in-state produce — like potatoes for vodka or barley for beer — to qualify for the Jersey Fresh designation. 
Farmer John Hart told the committee the legislation would help small farms promote their products and bring farmers into another industry. 
While Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex) called the bill a step in the right direction, she said that threshold is too high for businesses in New Jersey — home to harsh winters. She said she’s heard from distilleries and breweries who find it’s hard to source products year-round to meet Jersey Fresh standards.  
“In off-season, we might be importing grapes in, so unless we’re counting the water as being sourced in New Jersey, I think the 51% is too high of a standard,” Fantasia said.  
Katz said the standard is set by the agricultural industry. And the idea behind the bill was borne out of a New Jersey agricultural convention where none of the spirits had Jersey labeling on them. 
“It’s just a little bit of a unique label on that to show us that it’s from New Jersey, and hopefully it will grow,” said Katz. 
Members of the Assembly Commerce, Economic Development and Agriculture Committee passed the bill by a 7-2 vote, with one abstention from Fantasia. The measure, introduced last month, does not yet have a Senate companion.

[…]","The New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy in Santa Fe on June 14, 2023. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Law Enforcement Certification Board will ask the state Department of Justice to weigh in on whether it can accept police misconduct complaints filed by citizens.
At the opening of the board’s regular meeting on Thursday morning, Vice Chair Cody Rogers Benavidez said it will formally request a legal opinion from the department.
The board’s decision follows a petition backed by state legislators and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico that asks the board to adopt new rules, including ones that will address the issue of citizen complaints.
With some limited exceptions, New Mexico state agencies must adopt rules, also known as regulations or standards, which are used to actually carry out laws passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor.
However, the Law Enforcement Certification Board has been operating under rules that predate its existence for nearly two years, and which don’t address whether the board can hear citizen complaints.
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque), who carried the 2023 legislation that created the board, also noted during the meeting his hope that the board “moves forward with rulemaking.” The law creating the board requires the board to adopt new rules.
Maestas also said during public comment that police officers and sheriff’s deputies are government employees and should be open to scrutiny like any other professionals licensed by the state government.
“Anybody can file a complaint with regards to that profession, and the board can treat it accordingly,” he said.
Rogers Benavidez said NMDOJ is also helping the board write the new rules.
“We’re going to move forward with rulemaking and hopefully have something ready to go relatively soon,” she said. “Rulemaking is happening, it is underway and we will have drafts and other things to look at in the near future. It’s a priority for us, it’s a priority for the community, it’s a priority for everybody. So that’s not lost on us.”

What exactly those rules will say about police misconduct complaints also factors into the petition filed with the board. 
“Until the LECB can operate as an independent body without conflict of interest, and until it clarifies its responsibility for all law enforcement licenses in New Mexico regardless of rank or agency, there will be no legitimate investigation or adjudication of law enforcement misconduct in New Mexico,” the petition states.
Rachel Feldman, chair of the Indivisible SOS Santa Fe’s Civil Rights & Law Enforcement Reform Committee, filed the petition on May 15, following her own misconduct complaint in January against Department of Public Safety Secretary Jason Bowie, which accused him of taking over the board’s staff and gaining access to their confidential files, making it impossible for them to impartially investigate police misconduct complaints.
Last February, Bowie — who has denied the allegations — told the board that accepting the complaint as an official police misconduct filing would “set a dangerous precedent,” and predicted legal challenges from police associations.
Christopher Williams, Portales Police Department chief and New Mexico Police Chiefs Association vice president, told the board that municipal police chiefs oppose allowing citizens to file misconduct complaints because they are already held accountable through other means.
“The accountability is there,” Williams said. “Our municipalities have put us in the positions to run the agencies, and if we’re not doing that, people can reflect that to our councils, commissions, mayor, city manager, whichever form of government we operate under, to take the necessary steps to hold us, as the agency heads, accountable.”
Other state lawmakers and organizations back the petition, however.
Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) in a June 1 letter to the board argues that pressure on the board members to not fully act on civilian complaints undermines the law’s intent and public trust in institutions.
“Civilian oversight is not a threat to law enforcement — it is an essential element of a healthy democracy,” Romero wrote. “To suggest otherwise is to disregard the very principles of accountability and public service that our laws are meant to uphold.”
Romero had asked the board to put the petition on the agenda for Thursday’s meeting; however, it did not. Feldman said during public comment she received a letter at the end of the day on Wednesday indicating the board wouldn’t consider the petition.
ACLU-NM Executive Director Leon Howard also wrote a letter to the board on May 27 endorsing Feldman’s petition, in which he argued they should rigorously investigate allegations of misconduct, regardless of their source.
“Constraining members of the public from reporting alleged misconduct to the Board does not serve the public interest,” Howard wrote. “We urge the Board to adopt rules that allow for investigating and acting upon any report of alleged misconduct.”

She and her colleagues carried out this work in defiance of the federal government. And her efforts to accelerate the pandemic response later earned her a “Washingtonian of the Year” award from a state leadership board.
After a two-year vetting process, the University of Washington scientist landed a spot last year on the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influential panel of vaccine experts.
But on Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired Chu and the 16 other members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
“I really worry about the health and safety of people in our country and the future of our public health infrastructure,” Chu told reporters Thursday in a call with U.S. Sen. Patty Murray.

Kennedy said he wanted to restore trust in a panel he believed was rife with conflicts of interest.
And on Wednesday, he named eight replacement members, including several with track records criticizing vaccines. 
Kennedy himself has a history of promoting skepticism and unfounded theories about vaccines.
He came to Olympia in 2019, for example, to advocate against legislation that would have made it harder for parents to opt their children out of the measles, mumps and rubella shot in the middle of a measles outbreak.
The medical field largely condemned this week’s firings.
For over 60 years, the committee has reviewed vaccine efficacy and recommended who should receive which shots. The guidance goes to the CDC director, who usually follows the group’s decisions. These recommendations impact what vaccines insurers will cover, as opposed to forcing patients to pay out of pocket.
Members typically serve four-year terms. 
The purge comes on the heels of Kennedy announcing unilaterally that federal health officials would stop recommending COVID vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.
The federal panel is set to meet later this month, with recommendation votes scheduled for several vaccines, including for coronavirus.
“RFK Jr is not just crossing a red line for public health,” said Murray, a Democrat from Washington. “He is sprinting into dangerous, uncharted territory in support of totally deranged conspiracies, and he is dragging us all along with him.”
‘Gold standard’
Chu used the example of a vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, to show the importance of the committee’s work, and that it’s not just a rubber stamp for immunizations.
When reviewing data on the proposed vaccine, the panel found a risk of the rare neurological disorder known as Guillain-Barré Syndrome. So Chu, an infectious diseases professor at the UW, and her fellow members decided to recommend the shot only for older adults at a higher risk of getting severe symptoms from RSV.
“I think this example really illustrates the approach that the ACIP takes, that what we do is rooted in science, and that the decisions we make do not necessarily benefit the companies that have invested heavily to develop these vaccines,” Chu said. “As a result, ACIP is widely regarded as an international gold standard for vaccine decision making.”
Lacking trust in the committee’s potential recommendations, Chu advised doctors to turn to groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology for science-based vaccine guidance.
She worries that turning the previously “independent, unbiased” committee into something driven by “one person’s beliefs,” Americans will lose trust in national vaccine policy. This could lead to a patchwork of policies that differ state to state, Chu said.
“Washington state is a place where we have experts and scientists who work together,” she said. “There are other states where this may not exist, or where they may not choose to recommend vaccines, so that is going to create a lot of chaos.”
Murray pleaded with her Republican colleagues in the Senate to tell Kennedy his moves are unacceptable. To get confirmed, Kennedy made concessions to moderate Republicans, namely Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, over how much he would disrupt existing vaccine policy.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/vaccine-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Mike Lee, R-Utah, (right) participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics on Oct. 14, 2024. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah and other Western states, including Idaho.
Lee says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth. Opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
More than 100 environmental groups sign letter opposing return of public lands sale

Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by U.S. Reps. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
Idaho is among the states included in Lee’s proposal.

“How out of touch do you have to be to think our public lands should be sold off to pay for billionaire tax breaks?” Idaho Democratic Party Chairwoman Lauren Necochea said in an emailed statement on Thursday. “This shameless scheme would force the sale of millions of acres, including land right here in Idaho. These are the places Idahoans hunt, fish, hike, and pass down to the next generation.”
Necochea slammed Idaho’s U.S. Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, both Republicans, for voting on April 7 in opposition to the “Public Lands in Public Hands Act” bill amendment. That amendment would have blocked the sale of public lands to help pay for the Republicans’ budget reconciliation proposals. U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, also voted against the amendment. The only member of Idaho’s congressional delegation to vote in favor of of the amendment to protect public lands from sale was U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, also a Republican.
“Now the bill heads to the committee Risch sits on, and if his record tells us anything, he’ll side with the billionaires again,” Necochea stated. “Idahoans have made it clear: our public lands are not for sale. If Risch and Crapo keep siding with out-of-state developers and mega-donors, we’ll make sure they have plenty of time to enjoy the lands they refused to protect.”
 Utah senator’s proposal would require federal agencies to sell up to 3.3. million acres of public land

According to Lee’s new amendment, the U.S. Forest Service and the BLM would be required to dispose of between 0.5% to 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.
Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s: identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right, like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way is also off limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of Interior and Agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C., out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Environmental groups decry Lee’s public lands proposal

But that reasoning didn’t fly for a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C., director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West”; the National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal; The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Utah’s Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.
The Greater Yellowstone Coalition on Thursday said in a press release that it is calling on Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming U.S. senators to stand up and speak out against Lee’s proposal.
“Public lands belong to all Americans and are vitally important to the communities of Greater Yellowstone and other iconic western landscapes,” said Greater Yellowstone Coalition Executive Director Scott Christensen in the press release. “Our national public lands are not a luxury, they’re our legacy. These are outdoor spaces that connect us to each other, fuel the economies of western states, and provide clean drinking water to millions of Americans downstream. Once these lands are sold off, they’re gone forever.”

Gov. Phil Scott this week signed two significant pieces of health care legislation into law, both of which seek to rein in health care costs while bolstering state oversight of hospital practices.
One bill, H.266, signed on Wednesday, limits the amount that Vermont health care providers can charge for outpatient prescription drugs — medications administered by injection or IV that are often used to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases.
Another, S.126, signed Thursday, aims at a more comprehensive, long-term transformation of health care regulation in the state. Among other items, the bill requires state health care officials to develop a “statewide health care delivery plan” and present it to the Legislature by 2028. The legislation also directs the Green Mountain Care Board to implement reference-based pricing, a system that tethers the prices that health care providers charge to the equivalent rates that Medicare allows. 
Taken together, the two pieces of legislation represent a major effort by Vermont lawmakers and officials to curb health care costs while bolstering oversight of hospitals. 
The passage of the bills comes at a time when many health care entities in the state are struggling to stay afloat while patients and employers are facing skyrocketing insurance premiums.
“We have no choice,” Mike Fisher, Vermont’s chief health care advocate, said Thursday. “There’s a substantial risk that we’re going to lose key providers in communities around the state if we don’t intervene.”

‘The most consequential and immediate effort’
Among the main contributors to ballooning health care costs in Vermont are the extreme markups that hospitals charge for certain drugs, lawmakers and officials have said.
Currently, the average price of outpatient pharmaceuticals in the state are more than five times the amount of the manufacturer’s average sales price, by far the highest average markup in the nation, according to data compiled by the research and consulting firm RAND. 
H.266 caps the cost of those drugs at 120% of their manufacturers’ average sale price beginning in January 2026, a move that health officials say will go a long way toward immediately lowering Vermont’s rising insurance premiums and health care expenditures. 
Under the new cap, outpatient drug prices at Vermont hospitals would be the lowest in the nation, according to preliminary estimates. Hospitals in the state designated federally as “critical access hospitals” are exempt from the cap if they are not affiliated with a larger hospital network. That group of six hospitals not covered by the cap includes Copley Hospital in Morrisville, Gifford Medical Center in Randolph and North Country Hospital in Newport.
“It is the most consequential and immediate effort I have heard of to reduce health care costs in the state,” Owen Foster, chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, said Thursday.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, the state’s largest health insurance provider, has already said the measure would reduce the insurer’s projected rate of premium increases for next year by an estimated four percentage points for plans offered on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, and by three percentage points for public school employees.
But advocates for the state’s hospitals argue that the proposal would take away millions of dollars of revenue, requiring some health care providers to drastically tighten their belts and potentially cut staff and services.
“As we do this work, we’ll first ensure we look to administrative and other savings to limit and avoid, to the fullest extent possible, impacts on direct patient care and services,” Devon Green, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Care Systems, said in a written statement. “We know this will be challenging, but if we work with our state partners, the GMCB and together as hospitals, we are confident we can make meaningful progress.”

‘A significant amount of work to do’
Lawmakers and officials are looking to rein in hospital prices in the longer term with S.126, which requires the Green Mountain Care Board to establish a reference-based pricing system for the state’s hospitals by 2027.
Under the proposed model, the Green Mountain Care Board will limit the amount that hospitals charge private insurance companies for patient procedures by pegging those prices to the equivalent rates that Medicare sets for hospitals. 
State officials have long trumpeted reference-based pricing as a means of clamping down on rising health care costs.
A 2024 report produced by the care board found that implementing the cost saving system just for state and school employee insurance plans could save the state tens of millions of dollars annually. Doug Hoffer, the state auditor, similarly touted reference-based pricing as a cost-saving measure for the state’s health care system in a 2021 report. 
In practice, the measure represents a seismic shift in the way that hospitals price patient care, and it remains unclear exactly how the pricing system would work.
“There’s a significant amount of work to do to come up with a payment methodology for reference-based pricing,” Foster said. “All of these things are going to take a fair amount of time and effort to get it right, and so that’s what we’re initiating.”
S.126 also tasks state officials with transitioning the state’s health care system to a “global budget” payment model by 2030, meaning participating hospitals would receive fixed amounts of money from participating insurers to operate within a given year rather than receiving separate payments for individual procedures. 
Vermont already took steps in the direction of establishing a global budget model when, earlier this year, it signed onto a pilot program run by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services called the AHEAD model. The pilot program, if it moves forward, would allow the state to incorporate federally funded insurers into the payment system. 
Additionally, the bill would give state regulators more general oversight of health care providers, allowing the Green Mountain Care Board to collect more data and financial information from hospitals for the sake of standardizing pricing and budgets.
Last week, Scott also signed into law H.482, legislation that gives the Green Mountain Care Board emergency authority to reduce hospital prices in the case of risks of insolvency to insurers. 
“It just provides a layer of protection for the entire system,” Foster said. “I see that as a critical step in the situation that we’re in, with financial concerns at our primary insurer.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Although the vast majority of attention has been directed towards Washington D.C. for the upcoming weekend, the Philadelphia region will be hosting a three-day celebration to mark the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday.
The Army was founded in Philadelphia.
Erica Liermann, a retired U.S. Army staff sergeant, is the director of Marketing and Communications for the Association of the U.S. Army (AUSA) Penn and Franklin Chapters, a non-profit organization.
She said that the weekend is an opportunity to “celebrate our heritage” and focus on the history that the city has to offer.
“This event is not political,” Liermann said during a joint informational meeting of the state House and Senate Veterans Affairs & Emergency Preparedness committees.
The gathering kicks off on Friday afternoon in Valley Forge and includes a guided tour of the Washington Memorial Chapel, a Medal of Honor Grove tour and wreath laying ceremony. Both are free and open to the public. The final event of the evening will be a cocktail reception that is a ticketed event.
The bulk of the celebration will take place on Saturday in Philadelphia. It begins in the morning with an opening ceremony at Independence Mall that includes a flag-raising ceremony, the national anthem, and remarks from elected officials and military leaders.
A brief military and civilian parade will be held in the early afternoon that features service members, veteran groups, re-enactors, marching bands, and SOCOM Para-Commando Parachute Demonstration. An enlistment ceremony will take place later in the afternoon that will feature 250 new soldiers taking their oath, followed by an Army Field Band Concert.
“We are just turning the city into a party hall,” Liermann said. “We want everyone to consider everybody family. Everyone is welcome to join, to bring anybody.”
Liermann emphasized that these events, which are free and open to the public, will be family friendly and include rock walls. She also said there will be military and armored vehicles on display, although they will not be rolling down the street.
On Saturday evening, an invitation-only gathering will take place at the 1st City Troop Armory in Philadelphia.
The events wrap up on Sunday morning in Philadelphia with a church service at Christ Church, which will include remarks from the former Under Secretary of the U.S. Army Patrick Murphy, who represented a Bucks County-based district in the U.S. House from 2007-2011. Following mass, there will be a George Washington Commissioning Reenactment on the north side of Independence Hall, a procession to Washington Square, a wreath laying ceremony, and final words to mark the weekend long celebration. All of these events on Sunday are free and open to the public.
Thomas Long is a retired U.S. Army sergeant and organizer for GoArmy250, the group planning the event. He said the celebration is going to be monumental.
“The birthplace of the Army, the birthplace of the Navy, and the birthplace of the Marines are here, the same birthplace as the nation, but we came first,” he said.
Long, a disabled veteran, noted that Saturday is also Flag Day and Philadelphia will host the Navy and Marines 250th birthday celebrations later this year in the fall.
Earlier in the week, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, chairman of the Senate Veterans and Emergency Preparedness Committee and a retired U.S. Army colonel, held an event in Harrisburg honoring the U.S. Army’s anniversary. The state House also unanimously adopted a resolution sponsored by state Rep. Jim Haddock (D-Luzerne), designating June 14, 2025, as the “250th Birthday of the United States Army” in the state.

Michael Bennet joined a roundtable Thursday with Coloradans who would be hurt by proposed cuts to federal food assistance. They ranged from a grocery store manager in rural Baca County to a farmer from Wellington, north of Fort Collins.
The conversation comes as Congress considers billions of dollars of cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides monthly support for low-income families to buy groceries.
“(Cuts) would have a material effect on communities throughout Colorado, both urban and rural,” Bennet said. “It’s going to affect everybody, no matter where they live, and at a time when they need, desperately, help to just feed their families.”

The House narrowly passed its version of the GOP tax and spending bill last month, which for the first time would require states to shoulder some of the cost of SNAP — up to 25% — starting in 2028. Members of Colorado’s House delegation voted along party lines for the bill, with the GOP in favor and the Democrats opposed. Senate Republicans are pushing for more moderate SNAP cuts compared to their House counterparts.
“These cuts would be devastating,” Bennet said during the remote roundtable. “Now we know what the scope of the Senate cuts are versus the House cuts, and in either case, it’s the largest cuts that have ever been proposed.”
On Wednesday, Senate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman said the Senate GOP plan would result in federal savings of “$52 or $53 billion.”
Both chambers’ plans would tie the percent of the cost burden of SNAP on a state to the rate of that state’s payment errors. Under the Senate plan, states with error rates at 5% or lower would continue to pay nothing for SNAP, while states with error rates at 10% or higher would pay for 15% of benefits, Boozman said. The Senate plan would also create two levels for states with error rates between 5% and 10%. 
Colorado’s SNAP payment error rate is 8.61% as of 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This puts Colorado on a better track than the national average, which is 11.7%. 
Cuts unpopular in Colorado
Laurel Smith, a farmer in Larimer County, said any SNAP cuts would mean a significant loss of revenue and “a reduced quality of life for the community.”
“For my farm stand and my farmers market booth, 65% of my revenue comes from SNAP sales, that’s how much our community members desire SNAP,” said Smith, who herself used SNAP benefits when she was in her 20s to supplement her food budget.
Libby Triebel, a single mother of four who lives in Colorado Springs, said she often “barely scrapes by,” even with SNAP, which gives recipients an average of $6.16 per day for food.
“I do my best, and I make sure (my kids) don’t go a day without having their stomachs full,” Triebel said. “(Cuts) would be harmful, on these families out here that are just making it by to survive, and these kids don’t deserve that.”
About 159,000 Coloradans could lose SNAP benefits under House Republicans’ tax and spending bill, according to an analysis released Thursday by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. 
SNAP cuts are largely unpopular among Colorado voters, though many want to see lower error rates. Just 19% of Colorado voters want to see Congress decrease spending on SNAP, while 46% want to see it increase, 29% want it to stay about the same and 6% are unsure, according to a poll released Tuesday by Healthier Colorado.
‘A fight worth having’
During the roundtable, food bank leaders warned that any cuts to SNAP would add a greater burden on their organizations, which are already stretched thin. For Thai Nguyen, the founder of Kaizen Food Rescue, feeding Coloradans is deeply personal.
Nguyen, who was a refugee and homeless in her youth, knows what it’s like to not have access to healthy, fresh produce. Through her organization, she works to pay forward the help that she received from SNAP. Kaizen Food Rescue has served food to more than 57,000 people in the Denver metro area so far this year.
“We’re trying to just pretty much empower our communities and create a sense of belonging,” Nguyen said. 
Regardless of potential SNAP cuts, Kaizen Food Rescue is already reeling, after a $20 million Environmental Protection Agency grant it had been awarded for an on-site farm was recently revoked, according to Nguyen.
As congressional budget negotiations continue, Bennet urged the roundtable members to continue to push for the nutritious food support they want to see for their communities.
“Please continue to lead this fight, to champion this fight,” Bennet said. “It’s a fight worth having.”

Gov. JB Pritzker spent hours Thursday defending his governing record and Illinois’ immigration policies as he was peppered with questions from members of the U.S. House Oversight Committee.

Pritzker and Democratic governors Kathy Hochul of New York and Tim Walz of Minnesota were summoned to Washington, D.C., by committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., to answer questions about “sanctuary states.” The hearing mostly involved lectures from Republican members arguing immigration policies like Illinois’ diminish public safety while Democratic members blasted the Trump administration’s deportation raids.

“I invited these governors here today because as the chief executives of their states, they willfully ignore federal law, shield illegal aliens and pass the cost of free services onto their hardworking taxpayers,” Comer said. “It’s hard to figure out whose side these governors are on. They shield criminals while their own citizens pay the price.”

Pritzker countered by reiterating a point he has made publicly in Illinois several times since November’s election.

“As I have consistently said, violent criminals have no place on our streets, and if they are undocumented, I want them out of Illinois and out of our country,” Pritzker said. “And as we are reminded in Los Angeles this week, we can all agree that violence of any kind, whomever it is directed at, is unacceptable.”

Pritzker’s appearance before the committee came as nationwide protests grew over the Trump administration’s deportation tactics and increasing arrest numbers by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, especially in Los Angeles.

After protests and violence in that city last weekend prompted President Donald Trump to deploy hundreds of troops, thousands of people marched through the streets of Chicago this week protesting immigration raids. Some protestors briefly clashed with police, and 17 people were arrested, according to Chicago Police.

Dozens more protests are planned in Chicago and around Illinois on Saturday. Dubbed as “No King” protests, the gatherings are designed to contrast with a military parade planned by Trump in Washington on Saturday celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday. Saturday is also Trump’s 79th birthday.

Pritzker said if the Illinois National Guard ever needs to be activated to quell civil unrest, it’s done in coordination with local law enforcement. He criticized Trump’s deployment of the Guard in Los Angeles.

“It's wrong to deploy the National Guard and active-duty Marines into an American city over the objection of local law enforcement just to inflame a situation and create a crisis,” Pritzker said.

Republicans on the committee alleged “sanctuary state” laws violate federal immigration laws. Illinois’ 2017 TRUST Act, signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, prohibits Illinois law enforcement from detaining people based on their immigration status and assisting in civil immigration enforcement. Law enforcement cannot hold people based on federal immigration warrants in most cases, but they can make arrests for federal criminal warrants.

Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., suggested the three governors be criminally charged with obstruction because of their states’ laws. His comments follow Trump’s suggestion that California Gov. Gavin Newsom should be arrested.

“I have the highest duty to protect the people of my state, and indeed if Tom Homan were to come to my state and try to arrest us, me rather, I can say first of all that he can try,” Pritzker said of Trump’s border czar. “I can also tell you I will stand in the way of Tom Homan going after people who don’t deserve to be frightened in their community.”

Homan told CNN earlier this week Newsom hasn’t done anything to require an arrest.

Controversy over Illinois’ immigration policies

Pritzker blamed decades of federal government inaction on immigration and border security for exacerbating issues in the U.S. He also acknowledged to Comer that President Joe Biden inadequately handled immigration, particularly as 50,000 migrants were sent to Illinois mostly by the governor of Texas.

“We’re not in charge of the border in Illinois, I can tell you that,” Pritzker later told Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas. “We don’t have a border with a foreign country. ... We had 50,000 people who came from Texas because they were shipped to us. And let me tell you, I was in favor of helping them.”

Pritzker occasionally butted heads with Republicans throughout the hearing. Comer questioned the governor about the death of Katie Abraham in an Urbana car crash. She was killed in January by a suspected drunken driver illegally in the United States, according to WCIA. The GOP members mentioned several crime victims by name throughout the hearing.

Rep. Mary Miller, a Republican from Hindsboro, accused Pritzker of “rolling out the red carpet for illegal aliens,” adding “illegal aliens in our state have overwhelmed our communities.”

“I am not going to be lectured to by someone who extolled the virtues of Adolf Hitler,” Pritzker said, alluding to comments Miller made on Jan. 6, 2021.

Given multiple scenarios about what should happen to people who commit crimes while illegally in the country, Pritzker reiterated he supports deporting violent people but emphasized that must happen with due process. Democrats have argued Trump’s administration is deporting people without due process.

Republicans also criticized Illinois’ recent budgets for providing more than $1 billion of state health care benefits to people without documentation along with other programs for noncitizens. However, Pritzker is expected to sign a new state budget this month that eliminates a $330 million health care program for immigrants between ages 42 and 64.

“You do not keep track of any public service dollars in the state of Illinois that goes to illegal immigrants?” Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., asked Pritzker after the governor didn't offer specifics about exactly how much Illinois spends on “illegal immigration.”

And while Pritzker cast some blame on Republican-led border states for making Illinois part of recent waves of millions of migrants, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., remarked that while “Illinois didn’t ask for this crisis” as Pritzker said in his opening remarks, “neither did Yuma, Arizona.”

The hearing’s message

The hearing veered off topic several times. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Schaumburg Democrat, praised Pritzker’s work on the economy and spent time discussing Pope Leo XIV’s White Sox loyalty while Texas Republican Rep. Brandon Gill asked Pritzker whether he’s ever used a woman’s restroom.

“You’re admitting that this is just a political circus,” Pritzker responded to Gill.

Aside from Gill’s question about bathrooms, Pritzker largely avoided any immigration-related viral moments. The most intense grilling was reserved for Walz as the Democrat’s 2024 vice presidential nominee and Hochul over high-profile murders in New York.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., remarked the hearing featured a possible preview of the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. Pritzker and Walz are both viewed as possible candidates in the next presidential election.

Pritzker’s appearance at the committee hearing is the latest opportunity to grow his national profile. His schedule throughout 2025 has been dotted with national media interviews and out-of-state speaking engagements where he has often called for more protests of the Trump administration.

He echoed that message again Thursday.

“I encourage people to peacefully protest, and I have said that many times,” he said.

Pritzker said Trump “has created a situation where people are afraid.”

“They're afraid they’re going to get targeted because that is what’s happening under this administration. People are getting individually targeted when they stand up and speak out,” Pritzker said.

(Getty image)UnitedHealthcare paid $1 million and two Rhode Island health insurers paid lesser fines for violating state rules for health coverage of COVID-19 services. 
Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King announced Thursday that his office had finished collecting fines charged to UnitedHealthcare, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island (BCBSRI) and Aetna. The insurers were penalized for charging patients out-of-pocket costs for pandemic-related care, such as emergency room care, doctor visits, and hospital stays — services that should have been fully covered under a 2021 rule promulgated by Patrick Tigue, King’s predecessor in the the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC).
UnitedHealthcare incurred the heaviest fine while Blue Cross and Aetna were fined $20,000 and $10,000, respectively. Consent decrees for the insurance companies stipulated payment was due for UnitedHealthcare and Aetna on June 2, while Blue Cross needed to pay up by June 6. King said Thursday that the final payment was made last week.
“OHIC expects health insurance companies to comply with the law,” King wrote in an email. “When they do not, they must take corrective actions and face consequences.”
The fines accumulated from July 3, 2021, when the rule was formalized into general law, through May 11, 2023, when Rhode Island’s cost waiver rule expired and the COVID-19 public health emergency officially ended.
The cost waiver, however, only applied to fully insured plans, or coverage plans purchased by employers in which the insurer assumes the financial responsibility and risk. The cost mandate did not apply to people receiving services under self-insured plans — the kind of coverage often purchased by larger companies and held by about 60% of covered Rhode Islanders.
The three consent decrees OHIC released Thursday detail the scope of violations and how the insurers fixed their billing problems. UnitedHealthcare’s hefty $1 million fine derived from 1,545 claims in which Rhode Island plan members were wrongly charged for COVID-related care. In 2023, the company reprocessed the claims and refunded roughly $270,000 to affected members.
“We are pleased to have resolved this issue with the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner,” Bradley J. Alexander, a spokesperson for United, said in an email Thursday. “We remain focused on helping individuals access care while supporting our employees, our network of care providers, our clients and the communities we serve.”
The Blue Cross case was less straightforward. The insurer had already waived cost-sharing for COVID treatment in April 2020, according to spokesperson Rich Salit.
“BCBSRI’s cost-share waiver applied to all in-network services and out-of-network services received outside of Rhode Island,” Salit wrote. “For services in Rhode Island, BCBSRI was encouraging members to seek care from our broad network, as members going out-of-network could still be exposed to provider balance billing.”
Balance billing is when out-of-network providers charge patients for what insurance didn’t pay. 
According to the consent decree, Blue Cross believed its policy complied with the OHIC statute, at first indicating “that it was not waiving cost sharing on services related to the treatment of COVID-19 if such services were provided by out-of-network providers within Rhode Island.” 
Nevertheless, OHIC did not agree with that interpretation and penalized the company for not covering the out-of-network care in 19 claims. Blue Cross was required to pay $1,751.60 in refunds, plus the $20,000 fine. Salit said the claims came from eight plan members. 
“BCBSRI agreed to reimburse the cost sharing those members incurred and updated its policy, and the matter was resolved,” Salit wrote.
Aetna, a subsidiary of CVS, only had three claims flagged under the OHIC rule.  
“We are pleased this agreement resolves issues with the OHIC related to three (3) Aetna claims, which we reprocessed in 2022,” Phillip J. Blando, an Aetna spokesperson, wrote via email.
The penalty money goes into the state’s general fund, according to OHIC.

Courtesy of Georgia Building AuthorityThe state government and Atlanta City Council are at odds over a proposed skybridge connecting the state Capitol with a new legislative office building currently under construction across the street.
The Georgia General Assembly last year approved spending $392 million on the new office building to house government offices and committee hearings and for other refurbishments to the Capitol campus.
But the state needs authorization from Atlanta to build the skybridge, which would extend over Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, because part of its footing takes up some of the city’s right of way, and they also need air rights. Members of the city’s transportation committee voted 5-0 to table the project Wednesday.
David Mitchell, executive director of the Atlanta Preservation Center, said the Capitol is one of Atlanta’s most iconic buildings and the state hasn’t done enough to work with the city.
“To do this, to allow them to have this in perpetuity basically diminishes Atlanta’s autonomy, diminishes what Atlanta stands for and it allows the state to come in and basically say they can do whatever they want,” he told committee members. “It is offensive.”
Council members expressed concerns that the skybridge would interfere with efforts to revitalize downtown Atlanta.
“I’m a big believer that these sorts of pedestrian bridges – or as like to call them, hamster tubes – don’t do much or do anything to get people on the street and patronizing businesses because they’re able to go from building to building without really interacting with the street in a way that breaks the vibrancy that we’re looking for,” said Councilman Jason Dozier, whose district includes the Capitol.
Councilman Amir Farokhi agreed.
“Our friends from Dalton and Thomasville and Macon and Swainsboro, et cetera, we welcome them on our streets, and as you spend time during the legislative session at the Capitol and the state buildings complex, downtown Atlanta and the area around the state Capitol will be made better by folks walking around the footprint,” he said.
But Gerald Pilgrim, chief of staff at the Georgia Building Authority, said lawmakers, lobbyists and members of the public attending legislative hearings won’t pass any small businesses between the Capitol and the new legislative building whether they cross Martin Luther King Jr. Drive at the crosswalk or high above traffic.
“The state of Georgia, we own the blocks around this area,” he said. “There are no private businesses within multiple blocks of this location. The closest restaurants to the area are both owned by the Georgia Building Authority, so we really weren’t sure, we didn’t understand those (comments).”
“It’s just to connect the Capitol and the legislative office building,” he added. “You would still have to walk to get to the Capitol from a parking lot or parking deck or MARTA. You would have to walk to get to the legislative office buildings from those things. So it’s still the same.”
Pilgrim said the skybridge will improve accessibility to the Capitol and to committee hearings for young people, seniors and people in wheelchairs. He said his agency is ready to answer any questions the council has and hopes they can come to an agreement.
“Ultimately, the new legislative office is being built. It will be open October 31st, 2026, and hopefully we’ll have a bridge. If not, that’ll be something that somebody can add at a future time,” he said.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Gov. Phil Scott has signed this year’s housing package into law, creating a new financing tool for infrastructure that supports housing construction and enshrining stronger fair housing protections for immigrants.
The marquee policy in the bill, S.127, is the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, which is intended to help cover costly infrastructure upgrades that are needed to make residential development possible.
Essentially a smaller-scale version of Vermont’s existing tax increment financing program, CHIP will allow municipalities and developers to borrow money for infrastructure like roads, sidewalks and sewers for a housing project – and then use the increased property tax revenue from the homes to help pay back the debt. 
If developers and municipalities take advantage of CHIP to its full extent, the program has the potential to unleash $2 billion in infrastructure spending over the next decade – a level of investment that proponents believe could help move the needle on Vermont’s severe housing shortage. 
The bill’s passage was far from assured. The new infrastructure program was the subject of prolonged -– and at times acrimonious — debate among lawmakers before most went home in late May. House Democrats pushed hard for more guardrails to the new initiative. Their primary concern was that any new development that might have occurred even without help from the tax incentive would result in foregone property tax revenue to the overstretched Education Fund.
The Senate — and the Scott administration — had pushed for fewer rules, arguing that a more flexible version of the initiative would help add more homes to the statewide grand list and spread out the burden of rising education costs. A new coalition of housing advocates, Chamber of Commerce lobbyists and the Vermont League of Cities and Towns also pushed for a less strict version of the initiative.
Lawmakers ultimately landed somewhere in the middle – significantly raising a yearly tax increment cap favored by House Democrats, but retaining a version of a controversial “but for” test to determine whether a project would have happened without the public financing boost.

That proved enough to earn the Republican governor’s signature. But the infrastructure financing program is the only significant piece of Scott’s housing agenda that lawmakers followed through on this year. 
The Scott administration had vied for changes to the municipal appeals process for housing projects. But legislators failed to agree on reforming how and when neighbors can challenge housing developments in court, vowing to return to the issue next year once they’ve received a report back from the board that oversees Act 250. Scott had seen more room to amend the statewide development review law – which lawmakers overhauled last year – but legislators showed little interest in revisiting the subject this session.
S.127 also contains new housing protections for immigrants living in Vermont who lack legal status.
It adds citizenship and immigration status to the list of protected classes in Vermont’s fair housing laws, prohibiting discrimination on those grounds when someone is seeking to rent or buy a home. 
The legislation also mandates that a landlord needs to accept a range of forms of identification on a rental application in order to conduct credit and background checks – not only a Social Security number. Several immigrants testified at the Statehouse this session that landlords have frequently passed them over when they couldn’t provide the identifier. The advocacy group Migrant Justice pushed for the new protections.
The eclectic legislation also includes measures aimed at streamlining development on contaminated brownfield sites, a future study that would look at creating a statewide land bank for buildings that have fallen into disrepair, and a report on housing needs for people with developmental disabilities.

CHICAGO — The state of Illinois is investigating an automatic license plate reader system used in a northwest suburb after a Texas sheriff accessed the system to look for a woman who recently had an abortion.

This and hundreds of other searches, according to Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias, violated Illinois law.

Law enforcement agencies seeking to access license plate reader data collected in Illinois would first have to attest in writing that they wouldn’t use it to enforce other state’s laws relating to abortion or immigration.

“There is concern that other law enforcement agencies are breaking the law, whether they're doing it maliciously or unintentionally — that’s almost irrelevant,” Giannoulias said at a Thursday news conference.

Police in Mount Prospect, a village in suburban Cook County, set up a license plate reader system in such a way that allowed other law enforcement agencies to access data without providing written attestations. In addition to the Texas case, Giannoulias’ office said Mount Prospect’s system had been searched 262 times for immigration-related reasons between mid-January and the end of April.

The Texas case came to light after a report from the tech outlet 404 Media found the search impacted more than 83,000 license plate reader cameras in multiple states.

Giannoulias also noted that 46 out-of-state law enforcement agencies conducted searches of Illinois records that violated state law.

In response, Giannoulias’ office — which generally handles policy surrounding license plate readers and data sharing — announced it had instructed Flock Safety, a company that operates license plate readers in Mount Prospect, to shut off access to the system to out-of-state agencies. Giannoulias said he is also working with the Illinois attorney general to investigate further.

The secretary of state’s office said it will also establish an auditing system and additional safeguards.

“Automatic license plate readers are there to prevent violent crime, to prevent carjacking, to find stolen vehicles and to help when there’s a kidnapping, right?” Giannoulias said. “That’s what they are used for. When this data is being used to track people getting abortions or for ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to use to track down individuals based on immigration policy. That is a very slippery slope.”

Advocates for immigration rights and reproductive rights applauded the state’s move.

“Our statewide policies are only as strong as the counties, cities and municipalities that implement these policies across Illinois,” Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights Executive Director Lawrence Benito said Thursday. “When we are not on the same page, the misalignment can harm those in Illinois who are merely seeking the dignity and respect not afforded to them elsewhere.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota could lose up the half a billion dollars annually if a GOP-backed tax bill becomes federal law, Minnesota’s Medicaid director warned Thursday.
That could mean fewer services or tighter restrictions on eligibility, affecting health care for hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans and the hospitals and other providers that treat them. 
The bill, which has already passed the U.S. House on a 215-214 vote, is still far off from becoming law; Senate Republicans are drafting their own version, and the GOP remains deeply split over how to pay for tax cuts, which is their ultimate goal. For now, the House legislation is the most detailed public plan for how Republicans will fund an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, plus a bunch more. 
The tax cuts passed by the House would decrease federal revenue by about $3.7 trillion over the next ten years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. To offset the loss of income, Republicans want to cut spending by $1.3 trillion, mostly by targeting Medicaid and SNAP, which helps low-income people buy food. (The $2.4 trillion gap between the revenue and spending cuts would be added to the federal debt, which will in turn increase what taxpayers must shell out in interest payments, which have surpassed $1 trillion annually.)
Medicaid pays for health care for the elderly, low-income and disabled. The cost is shared between states and the federal government; last year, Minnesota spent $18 billion on Medical Assistance, which is Minnesota’s version of Medicaid. The federal government covered $11 billion of that. 
More than 1.2 million Minnesotans rely on Medical Assistance, and deep cuts would cause “serious harm” to Minnesotans, said John Connolly, Minnesota’s Medicaid director.
“Our position at the Minnesota Department of Human Services is that the bill currently on the table is inefficient, ineffective and fundamentally unfair,” Connolly said during a press briefing. 
Minnesota is already grappling with how to pay for care for an aging population as health care costs continue to rise. 
The state Legislature made $270 million in cuts to Medical Assistance this year, as spending on the program has risen faster than tax revenues. 
DHS estimates that if the U.S. House tax bill were to become law, the state would lose out on $500 million per year. The bill would cause between 152,000 and 253,000 Minnesotans to lose health insurance, according to Kaiser Family Foundation.
It would also push costs onto state and local governments, Connolly said, by requiring county and tribal governments to verify participants’ eligibility twice as often as they do now, and increasing the administrative burden for the state.
The largest chunk of the possible cuts to Minnesota comes from a provision that would reduce Medicaid reimbursements for states that subsidize health insurance for undocumented people. The Legislature voted this week to remove eligibility of undocumented adults for MinnesotaCare, a state- and federally-funded health insurance program for the working poor that is separate from Medical Assistance. 
As long as undocumented children remain eligible for MinnesotaCare — and if the House language becomes law — Minnesota would still have its federal funding cut by about $330 million, according to DHS.
Senate Republicans are wary of deep Medicaid cuts, and are instead expected to target SNAP, the New York Times reported Thursday. The Senate has not yet introduced its version of the tax bill. 
A proposal to shift 25% of federal SNAP benefit costs onto states would shift up to $220 million annual cost to Minnesota, according to the state Department of Youth and Family Services. 
More than 440,000 Minnesotans rely on SNAP benefits, according to DCYF. More than one-third are children, 18% are seniors and 14% are adults with a disability. 
If these federal cost shifts and cuts become law, the Minnesota Legislature would likely be forced to return to St. Paul for a special session to either raise taxes, cut services or move money around to fulfill lawmakers’ constitutional obligation to balance the budget.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250405_1017-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Credit: Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier on Thursday blamed the Biden administration for a scheme where tax collector employees sold driver’s licenses to immigrants who didn’t take the required test.
Uthemeier linked the fraud in Panama City to former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies during a press conference announcing the arrests of the two public employees, five people who helped the employees commit the fraud, and one woman who had paid to receive a passing grade on her driving skills test.
“I think today is yet another example of how the Biden border policy puts American families at risk. Here you’ve got hundreds of aliens that are cheating, that are breaking the law, that are buying driver’s licenses without taking the test, getting on the roads, putting everybody in danger,” Uthmeier said.
Immigration officials also appeared at the press conference with Uthmeier to further the message of cracking down on illegal immigration.

Bay County Sheriff Tommy Ford said most of the people who got fraudulent licenses had an immigration status authorizing them to drive illegally, based on the information gathered during the month-long investigation.
Police seized on Wednesday $120,000 that the employees appeared to have made from the scheme that has been going on for three years, Ford said.
“What we have found so far in this case is that most of the aliens that were getting driver’s licenses have some type of status. Some of that is the asylum status, which we know is a very controversial process, and doesn’t take a lot to get that status,” Ford said without presenting evidence that that was the case for the asylum seekers who bought the licenses.
At this time, Ford said officials didn’t know when the immigrants buying licenses had entered the country.
Ford didn’t have a narrow estimate of how many licenses the employees had sold, saying that hundreds or thousands of people living across the state could have bought a license from the Panama City tax collector’s office.
Asylum seekers with valid work permits can get driver’s licenses in Florida.
Chuck Purdue, Bay County’s tax collector, said his office first noticed indications of the fraud in April, when he saw one of the employees had conducted 295 road exams in one month — the average is 20 to 25. But he sidestepped a question about whether the supervisors of the arrested employees would face consequences, and said that the two employees were the only ones known to have sold the licenses.
“The sheriff and I’ll have to talk about that. We have not talked about it that far yet,” Purdue said.

For years it was criticized for being too narrow — despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered.
And since the program expired last June, Congress has been unable to bring RECA back, stymied by spending concerns. Although the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley that would greatly expand the program, including to cover downwinders in Idaho, it hasn’t been considered in the House.
 Could RECA protections be included in federal budget bill? Maybe.

During a press conference in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, advocates called on U.S. Sens. John Curtis and Mike Lee, both R-Utah, to get behind an amendment to Congress’ budget bill similar to what Hawley has proposed.
“There’s a real possibility that a RECA reauthorization and expansion could be included in H.R.1,” said Steve Erickson, a longtime advocate for downwinders. “But this will need the support of Utah’s congressional delegation, especially the full-throated support from Senator Lee and Senator Curtis. Without their support, the prospects for RECA are much diminished.”
Neither Curtis or Lee’s offices responded to a request for comment.
When asked about RECA during his monthly PBS news conference on Tuesday, Cox said he’s hopeful Congress will find a way to bring the program back during budget reconciliation. Cox, along with a coalition of 41 Utah lawmakers, have previously supported efforts to expand the program, specifically Hawley’s bill.
Hawley’s bill would expand the program to cover all of Utah and a handful of other Western states that weren’t previously included in RECA, while extending coverage to communities around St. Louis and territories in the Pacific that were impacted by nuclear weapons testing development.
“We’ll continue to express support for that,” Cox said on Tuesday. “The repercussions of that above-ground nuclear testing in Utah are very long lasting and many of us had family members that have been impacted. So I think it’s still important. Utah is not alone but Utah was significantly impacted.”
However, the governor noted there haven’t been any new developments in his talks with the congressional delegation.
 RECA has historically had bipartisan support in U.S. Congress

People who submitted their claims before the deadline last summer can still receive payments — but there’s no option for downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer, or didn’t know about the program.
“(We) continue to receive emails and phone calls from affected community members here in Utah who have received cancer diagnosis, asking where to apply and what to do,” said Carmen Valdez, a senior policy associate for the Health Environment Alliance of Utah. “It’s really discouraging to say that the program is expired and they can no longer apply, but they can contact their delegation about it.”
RECA has always had bipartisan support. Originally sponsored by late Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, both Democrats and Republicans have since advocated for its expansion. That includes U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who have lobbied with Hawley to expand the program.
“This is not a partisan play by any means,” said Erickson.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)From Ironwood in the western Upper Peninsula to Adrian, near the Ohio border, more than 70 “No Kings Day” protests against President Donald Trump are planned in Michigan this Saturday.
Included in that list are larger demonstrations set for Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Lansing, and Kalamazoo, among more than 1,500 planned in cities across the nation to protest against “authoritarian overreach and the gross abuse of power” which No Kings protest organizers say has been demonstrated by the Trump Administration.
The protests are timed to coincide with festivities scheduled in Washington D.C. to ostensibly celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, but also Trump’s 79th birthday, with a military parade featuring nearly 7,000 soldiers, and 150 vehicles, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, as well as military flyovers from 50 aircraft. 
Estimated to cost $45 million, the planned exhibition has drawn criticism as an ostentatious display at a time congressional Republicans have pushed through a budget plan that would gut federal safety net programs like Medicaid and food assistance, simultaneous to Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles over immigration protests.
“Rapid and widespread attacks against vulnerable members of our communities and those who voice political dissent, illegal and arbitrary arrests and deportations, antidemocratic acts of repression of free speech, and flagrant defiance of the courts demonstrate that the current administration stands in opposition to the founding principles of our nation,” organizers of Detroit’s protest said in a statement. 
Set to begin Saturday at 1 p.m. in Clark Park, Detroit’s No Kings protest will feature U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit), an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts and use of the military against civilian protestors in LA.

The Grand Rapids protest will start at 10 a.m in Ah-Nab-Awen Park, with speakers including City Commissioner Marshall Kilgore and Rev. Nathan Dannison of the Fountain Street Church.
“Local community organizations will have ‘Take Action’ stations providing attendees with specific actions to take,” organizers said in a release. “This rally will also include family-friendly activities. We follow the principles of non-violence protests. Harassment and hate speech will not be tolerated.”
That same message was echoed earlier this week by state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia), who along with state Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor), urged Michiganders to take part in the protests, but do so peacefully.
“Let me be crystal clear: We unequivocally condemn any violence. That has no place in our movement for peace and justice. Everyone should use their voice peacefully, but the Trump administration intentionally provoked the situation by sending a force of armed and armored agents to round up immigrant workers,” Pohutsky said.
Smaller municipalities are also holding protests, including in Republican-heavy areas like Livingston County, which has “No Kings” protests planned at the Historic Courthouse in Downtown Howell and at the public amphitheatre adjacent to Brighton’s Millpond.
The Brighton gathering will feature Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel and Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Secretary of State.
Another of the larger No Kings protests is planned at the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing, which starts with a “Kick Out the Clowns” rally at noon, followed by a sidewalk march around the Capitol and then a “No Kings” carnival from 3-6 p.m. 
“Participants are encouraged to bring signs and flags while they stand in solidarity against this abuse of taxpayer funds. Planned circus-themed activities will highlight the absurdity of the administration’s self-aggrandizement and flagrant disregard for American laws and norms,” stated a release.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AMR_0021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Free.,"Teachers, parents, Arizona senator rally against GOP plans to reduce education spending",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/teachers-parents-arizona-senator-rally-against-gop-plans-reduce-education-spending,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly joined education advocates, parents, teachers and students Thursday to blast congressional Republicans’ proposed cuts to education.The Arizona Democrat and demonstrators spoke out against GOP lawmakers’ “big, beautiful bill,” an attempt to slash billions of dollars in federal spending to offset the cost of President Donald Trump’s sweeping agenda and tax cuts.Kelly lambasted the private school voucher program tucked into the House’s version of the reconciliation package. The proposal would allocate $5 billion a year in tax credits for people donating to organizations that provide private and religious school scholarships.“They want to play by different rules — a backhanded way to take your tax dollars and stick it into private schools,” he said. “Let me tell you, Arizona has been fighting this fight for years now, and it is not going well, and the public education that kids can get in the state of Arizona is not the same as it was 10 years ago, so this is not a good idea — it’s a horrible idea.”Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to allow the package to move through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote threshold that generally requires bipartisanship.The House narrowly passed its version of the legislation in May, and it is starting to see proposed changes in the Senate, including on the higher education system.Advocates also blasted the House reconciliation bill’s cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as well as the private school voucher program.‘A direct threat to our children’s future’“We’ve got to make it easier for kids to get an education,” Kelly said. “We’ve got to make it easier for kids to get the support they need — to get a good start, a good start in life and get a good career that you can actually raise a family on, and that starts right here, right now, with not allowing this Congress and this White House to take us backward.” The National Parents Union hosted the rally alongside Educators for Excellence, Education Leaders of Color and EdTrust.“All week long, parents, students and educators — the real people on the front lines of America’s public schools — have been walking these halls of Congress, meeting with members of the House, members of the Senate, and making one thing crystal clear: this so-called ‘big, beautiful bill’ is a direct threat to our children’s future, and we will not stand for it,” said Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, which includes more than 1,800 affiliated parent organizations across the United States.“There is nothing big or beautiful about slashing billions from public education,” she said.Meanwhile, Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the Education Department, as he and his administration have sought to dramatically redefine the federal role in education and dismantle the agency.GOP senators’ take on higher ed overhaulEarlier this week, Republicans on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released their draft proposal for the reconciliation package, which offers some similarities to the higher education system provisions in the House version of the bill.Some similarities between the House and Senate versions include: massive changes to student loan repayment options, the creation of a Workforce Pell Grant program and the elimination of both the Grad PLUS program and the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan.But the Senate’s portion leaves out some of the House’s most sweeping provisions affecting higher education affordability and access.Unlike in the House, the Senate’s version does not raise the minimum number of credit hours to qualify for the maximum Pell Grant award from 12 credit hours per semester to 15 credit hours, nor does it repeal subsidized loans or eliminate the “90/10 rule,” which requires that at least 10% of the money for-profit institutions receive derives from non-federal sources.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Esperanza Moran, who openly rallied for the dismissal of former LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick, is the subject of an anonymous whistleblower complaint, at least one Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint and a separate complaint filed with the governor. 
Moran is accused of trying to have multiple LSU Health Shreveport administrators fired. 
Esperanza Moran lives in Shreveport and is married to wealthy businessman Scott Moran. The couple own several businesses, including Moran Oil Co., and give generously to Republican political campaigns, including Landry’s. 
Sen. Sam Jenkins, D-Shreveport, who represents the district where LSU Health Shreveport is, said that while questions were raised about Esperanza Moran, Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, who represents her district, was steadfast in his support of her. 
Senators rarely reject gubernatorial appointments. Appointees typically must only secure the support of their own senator to receive confirmation. 
Senate confirmation allows Moran to serve on the LSU board until June 1, 2030, when she would be eligible to be appointed to another term.

(Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service/Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1)As hot, dry weather settles in, officials are predicting a greater than usual likelihood that Idaho will experience significant wildfires this summer.
The Predictive Services Office at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise’s new forecast for June through September shows an above normal potential for significant wildfire developing in northern Idaho this month. The above normal potential for significant wildfire then expands into southern Idaho and central Idaho from July into September.
“What that means is if an accidental ignition occurs or a lighting ignition occurs, there is going to be a greater potential for those ignitions to develop into serious incidents that get large enough to affect people or pose a risk to life or property,” said Rebecca Paterson, a public affairs specialist for the the Bureau of Land Management who is based at the National Interagency Fire Center, or NIFC, in Boise.

Even though there was a healthy snowpack in many parts of Idaho this winter, warm, dry weather has rapidly melted the snowpack, which contributes to the risk of wildfire, Paterson said.
Abundant drying grass crops throughout southern Idaho, mixed with forecasts for low levels of precipitation and high temperature also contribute to the risk, she said.
Located next to the Boise Airport, NIFC is the country’s headquarters for wildland fire operations. Several different agencies are represented at NIFC, including the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and more.
State of Idaho, federal government set aside money to boost firefighter pay following concerns
Both the state and federal government have taken steps to address widespread concern over pay for wildland firefighters.
In March, the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee approved $1 million in pay bonuses for state firefighters working for the Idaho Department of Lands.
That same month, the U.S. Department of Interior announced permanent pay increases for federal and tribal wildland firefighters.
Paterson said the federal pay increases are a result of years worth of efforts to help recruit and retrain firefighters. She said the firefighters who stand to benefit most from the pay increases are firefighters in the beginning stages of their career at the lower end of the pay scale.
It’s too early to tell how the raises are affecting retention, but on Monday afternoon a Department of Interior spokeswoman said hiring is up slightly compared to a year ago. As of June 2, the U.S. Department of Interior had hired 4,830 wildland fire personnel across the country, which is up slightly from a year ago, the spokeswoman said.
But even with steps taken to address pay and turnover, Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller still expressed concern with the levels of federal nonfirefighting staff and the ability to hire and retain mid- to upper-management level engine captains in Idaho.
“I am confident in the amount of resources we are going to have this year (at the state level, but) what is concerning is the support positions at the federal level,” Miller said in a phone interview Monday. “We have been told to expect the same level of initial attack resources from the U.S. Forest Service, but what is concerning is that many nonfire staff who pay critical roles in incident management teams have taken various voluntary departure options offered by the federal government.”
At the state level, Miller said Idaho will also have slightly more firefighters than last year. But Miller said Idaho still struggles to fill permanent engine captain positions. As a result, Miller said the Idaho Department of Lands will only be able to staff 50% of the engines with seven-days-per-week coverage.
Miller said the Idaho Department of Lands is looking to other permanent staff members who have retained their fire qualifications to help boost staffing and coverage.
“We are ready to go this fire season,” Miller said. “We have most of the resources we need and, again, we will be relying heavily on others within the Department of Lands to participate at some level during fire season.”
Support for Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund
Another potential concern is funding in Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund. This year, the Idaho Legislature approved transferring $40 million to the state’s Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund, the Sun previously reported. However the $40 million is less than the $58 million the state spent fighting wildfires in 2024 alone.
If the state spends more money than it has available to fight wildfires, it can still pay its bills through a process called deficiency warrants. But then the state would need to go back to the Idaho Legislature next year with bills for the deficiency warrants, which would be a little bit like using a credit card to pay wildfire bills.
At any rate, Gov. Brad Little had requested $60 million in new funding (not just the $40 million) for the wildfire account and urged legislators to give the state the tools it needs to aggressively fight wildfires from the beginning.
Partnerships and relationships between different state and federal agencies are key factors in fighting wildfires.
In Idaho, the location of where a fire starts plays a role in determining which agency responds. Depending on jurisdiction, what type of land the fire is located on and how big the fire is, federal wildland firefighters, state firefighters, the local community fire department or a volunteer fire protection service may show up to fight the fire.
Fire officials call on the public to help reduce risk of wildfire
While firefighters cannot prevent lightning strikes from starting wildfires, Paterson did say Idahoans can help reduce the risk of wildfire this summer. Most of the wildfires in Idaho in recent years have been caused by people.
Dousing all campfires and extinguishing them dead out, avoiding parking vehicles on grass and preventing chains from dragging behind vehicles and throwing off sparks can all help prevent wildfires.
“Weather, climate and fuel conditions cause those ignitions to become serious incidents, perhaps a lot faster than you expect, and tax responders’ ability to respond,” Paterson said.

Title X, a federal program that has been providing money for family planning services to states for over 50 years, flows through Converge to 91 clinics around the state. On March 31, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Converge it was withholding $4.5 million intended for Mississippi’s Title X program indefinitely during an investigation into the organization’s diversity, equity and inclusion practices. 
On Monday, nonprofit Converge signed a joint letter with the six other states whose Title X funds had been withheld requesting that HHS update grantees on the status of their funding. 
“Three months into HHS’ withholding, we remain frustratingly in the dark about the agency’s plan,” Audrey Sandusky, vice president of communications and marketing at Converge, told Mississippi Today. “The consequences of inaction are real and dangerous, from rising rates of cervical cancer and unplanned pregnancy to a surge in congenital syphilis.”
The grantees’ letter, addressed to HHS Deputy Director Amy Margolis, said all the recipients had met the 10-day deadline imposed on them by the federal agency to submit information, but had not heard so much as a confirmation in the 60 days since then. 
“In light of the harmful impacts of our Title X funding being withheld, we request that you share information about your process and timeline for releasing the funding by June 20th and releasing the funds as soon as possible,” the letter read. 
HHS has not responded to Mississippi Today’s request for comment about why it withheld Converge’s funding. 
In its original letter to Converge, HHS alleged the nonprofit “could be in violation” of the terms of the award and parts of the federal civil rights law. The allegation referenced a 2020 statement the nonprofit made committing to diversity in health care amid the George Floyd protests. 
In the two months since their federal funding stopped flowing, Converge leaders have focused all efforts on fundraising and expanding access to low-cost care through telehealth and pop-up clinics. 
The next pop-up clinic will take place July 26 at the Jackson Medical Mall and will include physical exams, testing for sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy tests and preconception counseling, and prescriptions for birth control. All services will be available on a sliding scale. 
“A month delay may not sound like a huge deal to some people, but when you’re talking about women’s health care, one month could be a huge deal,” said Converge co-executive director Jamie Bardwell. “You could be missing your prescription for birth control, (and) perhaps it results in an unplanned pregnancy. Perhaps you don’t get screened for an STD, STI. Congenital syphilis is very high in Mississippi. These are things that just have a very negative effect for women and their children.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/06163254/3X0A6460-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Campuses across the University System of Maryland were told Thursday to plan for 7% budget cuts in the coming year. (Screengrab courtesy University of Maryland video)Campuses in the University System of Maryland were warned Thursday afternoon to brace for another 7% cut to their budgets in the coming year, on top of the 4% the system was forced to absorb as part of a statewide budget challenge earlier this year.
University System Chancellor Jay Perman, in a video message to more than 40,000 faculty and staff at campuses across the state, said individual campus presidents all agree that personnel cuts should be a last resort. But he noted that, given the size of the reduction and the different situations on different campuses, “for some universities, personnel actions cannot be taken off the table.”
And he warned that the fiscal situation would likely get worse, as federal budget reductions and job cuts continue this year.
“To those affected by these cuts, there’s little I can say that makes it any better,” Perman said, looking into the camera. “I’m sorry that this is happening. It’s not a reflection of your value to the system, to your university, to the students we serve.”
The cuts do not come as a surprise: In May, the Board of Regents unanimously approved a resolution to let campus presidents assess savings such as furloughs, reductions in salaries and the closing of schools for a certain number of days. That resolution was approved as the university system’s 12 institutions and three regional centers stared down a reduction of $155 million, or 7% of their fiscal 2026 budgets.

	While the message may not have been surprise, its delivery — broadcast to every worker in the system — was unusual.
“I don’t usually send out a budget message, like this one” to all employees of the statewide system, Perman said in the video. “I’m doing it now because these aren’t typical times.”
Perman said the cuts would be managed campus-by-campus, “because there’s no one solution for the taking.”
“I know your campus leaders are sharing with you what these cuts will mean, not only for university programs and departments, but for you and your colleagues,” Perman said.
Perman said he and campus leaders agreed to try and “protect our people as much as possible,” look for other cost savings or ways to generate revenue before cutting in to payrolls.
While the next round of cuts will be challenge, Perman also warned of future budget cuts as Maryland awaits federal budget decisions that could result in federal employee layoffs or loss of aid.
“We know it could get worse,” said Perman, adding that the possibility of further cuts was being incorporated in the latest cuts.
Senate Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery) acknowledged the federal cuts to higher education programs by the Trump administration could mean more pain for universities.
“They’ve been expecting it and planning for it,” King said about school leaders preparing for budget cuts. “There are probably more to come.”

It hosted a hearing for proposed Medicaid expansion work requirements on June 12, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)More than a dozen people raised concerns and questions about unintentionally separating patients from their health care and other aspects of South Dakota’s proposed Medicaid expansion work requirements during the plan’s final public hearing Thursday in Sioux Falls.
Dana Bacon, state government affairs director at The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, told the state Department of Social Services his organization has “pretty big concerns” due to the technical problems, costs and unintended loss of coverage that people encountered during attempted work requirements in other states.
“That’s going to make individuals, families, systems and communities pay a price for the outcomes,” Bacon said. “We have a good sense of where this waiver is going, but we still see these problems getting in the way of the stated goal of making sure people get the health care they need.”
 

How to submit written comments
Written comments about South Dakota’s Medicaid expansion work requirements proposal may be submitted by June 18 via email to MedicaidSPA@state.sd.us with the subject line “SDCareerLink Public Comment,” or mailed to the Division of Medical Services, Department of Social Services, 700 Governors Drive, Pierre, SD 57501-2291.



Other people questioned the need to implement work requirements and expressed concern about a potentially disproportionate impact on tribal members, as well as the potential barrier the plan could create to health care for sick, homeless and older people.
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match — funding that could be in jeopardy, pending the outcome of congressional action. Last year, voters passed another constitutional amendment to let the state seek approval from the federal government to impose work requirements on expansion enrollees.
The state began drafting its proposal immediately following the end of the state legislative session in March, before debates about potential federally imposed work requirements heated up at the congressional level. Those debates are ongoing.
The department only heard from one person at its first hearing in May. The state is also accepting written comments through Wednesday, which will be included in the state’s application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services later this summer.
South Dakota’s plan would require adult Medicaid recipients to work, train, attend school or serve as a caretaker for a child or elderly or disabled person in their home unless they qualify for an exception. Compliance with the state-level work rules would be reviewed on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal, rather than at the time of application. The state would not require a set number of hours of work or education time.
South Dakota would allow exceptions for people who are:

Pregnant or up to 12 months postpartum.
Disabled, as determined by the Social Security Administration.
Diagnosed with cancer or another serious or terminal medical condition by a physician.
In an intensive behavioral health treatment program, hospitalized or living in a nursing home.
In an area with unemployment 20% or more above the national average and are exempt from Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.

As of last month, 30,542 South Dakotans were covered by the Medicaid expansion. The state estimates 80% of them already work or qualify for an exception. The proposed state-level work requirement would reduce enrollment by an estimated 5-10% in the first year. That would save the Medicaid program between $48.9 million and $71 million in the first year, the department says.
Federal action could make SD’s Medicaid work requirements ‘an exercise in futility,’ official says

Department officials explained that expansion enrollees would be sent three notices before being removed from Medicaid rolls. People could reapply later if they don’t meet work requirements at their renewal time.
Heather Petermann, Medicaid director at the department, said people who are seeking treatment for substance use disorder or other mental health disorders outside of intensive treatment programs could obtain an exemption if their physician or health care provider provided documentation that they can’t work because of their condition.
Department Secretary Matt Althoff said the state’s proposal is meant to be administratively simple and to encourage work among Medicaid recipients rather than track hours. 
“We are helping them, we believe, not only by providing a safety net, but a lift up. Isn’t it true that personal industry is the antidote to poverty?” Althoff said. “The more that we can do to discover fulfillment through serving others, the more that we can do to garner an income that we earn, the higher likelihood we will be able to escape the clutches of poverty.”
Other suggestions made during public comment during the hearing included:

Adding volunteer or community service time as an exemption, to benefit older adults who can’t find employment because of their age.
Exempting Indian Health Service beneficiaries, since they are eligible for Medicaid coverage at the federal level even if they do not meet other Medicaid requirements, such as income limits.
Allowing more flexibility to exempt caregivers of older adults who don’t share the same residence.

Trustees at the Pensacola university agreed to pay Diaz an annual base salary of $643,000 with no performance incentive. Other benefits for the one year contract total about $100,000 to pay for his car, housing, and moving expenses.
As commissioner, Diaz makes nearly $324,000 per year.

During the meeting, trustees said long goodbyes to outgoing President Martha Saunders, who resigned before her contract was set to expire. She has been president since 2017.
Saunders’ contract pays her a $536,271 base annual salary and up to 20% performance bonus.
“We will be going into a presidential search and we will be having a firm conduct a compensation analysis and what we’re seeing historically here through all the universities that have gone through presidential searches is that salaries for these university presidents are increasing. Period. So everyone needs to get ready to see that when the compensation analysis comes out,” Chair Rebecca Matthews said. 
“I don’t particularly care” for the salary,  said Alonzie Scott, who also had issues with other provisions in the contract.
Scott, who has been on the board since 2018, noted the contract requires a two-thirds vote of trustees to remove the president. Saunders’ contract and trustee bylaws call for a simple majority vote.
According to Matthews, Diaz requested the supermajority vote for removal.  
“I hope he can do things even comparable to” Martha Saunders, Scott said.
Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Board of Governors, a board majority-appointed by the governor, appointed a slate of eight UWF trustees last winter. At the time DeSantis said the UWF community needed to “buckle up” and prepare for a conservative makeover.  The new UWF board of trustees has caused widespread backlash among the university community and in the Florida Senate. 
The university community has shunned the overhaul of the college. It has launched  Save UWF, and sent people to Tallahassee to oppose the trustees’ during the Senate confirmation hearings.
After trustees were confirmed Saunders resigned.
The trustees with tenure longer than six months have largely opposed the new direction.

Sentiment
Matthews called the contract “conservative” and said she is “Happy and feel extremely comfortable” with it. 
Matthews is the chair a direct support organization to the Department of Education, a position that Diaz appointed her to. DeSantis appointed her to one of his transition committees.
Diaz called his contract “Proper and conservative.”
No votes in opposition to the contract could be heard through the livestream of the meeting.
Trustee Dick Baker, who has been on the board since 2016, said he hopes “we can go forward and not keep looking back or start trying to find things from the past to dig into.”
“I want to be 100% behind President Diaz as we go forward and get the community back working with us to make this the best university,” Baker said, saying he thinks Diaz “desires of doing the very best that he can.”
Diaz will vacate his job in the DeSantis administration to take on the roll of interim president.
His path to interim-presidency mirrors Florida International University President Jeanette Nunez, who was the sole finalist for her job after resigning as lieutenant governor to become interim president. Simultaneously, former President Kenneth Jessell resigned before the end of his contracted term. 
While he didn’t vote against Diaz, Scott had reservations.
“My instincts tell me not to vote for this, but Mr. Baker is convincing me to go the other way somewhat to say that we’re going to try to figure out how to make this work. I do believe we have overcompensated Mr. Diaz for work that he hasn’t performed yet,” Scott said.

Bills to outlaw those materials were back again before the Senate Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee on Thursday.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXTestifying before the committee was bill sponsor and state Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing). Tsernoglou said that each time she gets the opportunity to tell her fellow lawmakers there’s a need for more regulation in artificial intelligence, the issue becomes worse because In Michigan, and across other states, there are bad actors who use artificial intelligence to create non-consensual fake pornographic media.
“As the percentage of the population that uses artificial intelligence technology, either knowingly or unknowingly, continues to grow exponentially, we must stay hyper-vigilant in our efforts to regulate the technology and to ensure that our most vulnerable community members are not exploited or harmed,” Tsernoglou told the committee on Thursday.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Department of Homeland Security both are reaching out to the American public about the rising issue of sexual exploitation taking place online, cautioning that children particularly are often being targeted.
Both agencies cited a study from Sensity AI, a research company tracking deepfake media, which found that between 90% and 95% of deepfake videos online since 2018 are nonconsensual pornography and about 90% of those nonconsensual videos are of nonconsensual porn are of women.
As the Michigan Senate considers House Bills 4047 and 4048, introduced by Tsernoglou and Rep. Matt Bierlein (R-Vassar) to ban nonconsensual deepfake pornography and place criminal penalties on their production, lawmakers in the committee meeting Thursday shared how the issue has impacted people they know.
State Sen. Paul Wojno (D-Warren) said he appreciates that the bills address the nefarious nature of the materials, especially when it comes to extortion. He shared that a friend of his daughter had been extorted by someone using a fake image.
“[A] deep fake was created and they sent it to her and threatened that if she didn’t pay a certain amount of money, it would be posted on social media,” Wojno said.
These extortionists don’t even necessarily know their victims, said Zoey Brewer, policy and grassroots coordinator with the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. But by using technology that is becoming more realistic and more accessible to the public, Brewer said criminals are extorting money from victims or creating such intense anxiety in their victims that they can’t attend school or work and, in some cases, they resort to suicide.

The bills have bipartisan support, and cleared the state House with a nearly unanimous vote in April, just as they did last session. But the bills failed to clear the state Senate last year during a turbulent lame duck session.
State Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), the committee’s chair, said the Senate had “every intention” of taking up the bills, but she’s glad lawmakers are pressing the issue again this session.
 
Deepfakes don’t just impact celebrities and they aren’t harmless jokes, Bierlein said. Michigan’s laws have left families and law enforcement without proper recourse to go after extortionists making fake sexual materials, he added.
Among the groups who submitted support for the bills was the Michigan Sheriff’s Association.
The legislation being considered by the committee would send a strong message that Michigan will not tolerate digital abuse and would not only criminalize nonconsensual deepfake pornography, but also allow victims to sue the individuals who create it, Bierlein said.
“They’re deeply invasive, traumatic violations that can ruin lives,” Bierlein said of deepfake pornographic media. “Reputations, careers and mental health have all been damaged or destroyed by the weaponization of someone’s likeness, often targeting women, minors and vulnerable individuals. This is not a hypothetical issue, in my own district I have heard from families and young people who have been directly affected by these people.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Facetune_24-04-2025-17-00-33-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Free.,Trump signs law repealing tailpipe emission standards affecting 18 states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-law-repealing-tailpipe-emission-standards-affecting-18-states,,"President Donald Trump signed a Congressional Review Act resolution Thursday that revokes California’s authority to set tailpipe emissions standards, upending policy in California and 17 other states that tie their standards to that of the Golden State.California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Democratic attorneys general in 10 other states immediately sued to block enforcement of the law. Through a process that allows Congress to undo recent executive branch rules, the law repeals a U.S. Environmental Protection Act waiver allowing California to set a schedule for emissions standards for cars and trucks.Trump signed two other resolutions that repeal the state’s authority to ban sales of new gas-powered vehicles in the state by 2035 and to regulate emissions on heavy trucks.At a White House signing ceremony, Trump said the law would allow greater consumer choice and lead to less expensive vehicles.“Your cars are going to cost you $3,000, $4,000 less and you're going to have what you want,” he said. “Again, you can get any car you want.”Simple majority voteThe procedure used to pass the law was controversial because of the use of the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, which allows a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate instead of the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold.Both the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the EPA waiver was not a rule and that the CRA could not be used. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune used the procedure anyway, and the measure passed 51-46.The states suing over the law argued that process was illegal, saying that the CRA was “deemed inapplicable by every nonpartisan arbiter and expert who analyzed the question.”“While all fifty States consented—through their Senators—to these expedited procedures for congressional disapproval of federal rules, no State consented to the CRA as a means for Congress to negate state rules,” the Democratic attorneys general wrote. “Nor would any State have done so.”The states joining California in the lawsuit are Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Vermont and Washington.Clean Air ActThe federal Clean Air Act of 1970 generally prohibits states from setting their own air quality standards. But a section of the bedrock environmental law allows California, which had stringent environmental standards at the time the federal law was passed, to set its own standards.While the other 49 states may not set their own standards, any state can adopt California’s standards as its own.That means the law Trump signed Thursday has effects far beyond California’s borders, which the president noted.“The federal government gave left-wing radicals in California dictatorial powers to control the future of the entire car industry, all over the country, all over the world, actually,” he said.The law, which both chambers of Congress passed last month, applies to 17 states that follow California standards. In addition to those suing, those states are Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Wyoming State Rep. John Winter used a racist slur before lawmakers visited the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, a site memorializing Japanese Americans' forced internment during World War II. 
The post Wyoming lawmaker apologizes for anti-Japanese slur appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming State Rep. John Winter apologized for his use of a racist slur to describe Japanese people before lawmakers visited the Heart Mountain Interpretive Center earlier this week, according to a national news site.
On Tuesday, Winter, chair of the House Agriculture, State and Public Lands Committee, referred to Heart Mountain as “Jap camp,” while informing committee members about what time they had to assemble for the tour. 
The Thermopolis Republican’s use of the slur, which Japanese Americans worked to remove from America’s lexicon after World War II because it was used to dehumanize them, drew condemnation from people involved with Heart Mountain. As outrage over the slur grew this week, Winter apologized Thursday in an email to AsAmNews, a news organization that covers issues of importance to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
“The term that I used just slipped out of my mouth as that is what it has always been referred to in my world as a kid,” Winter wrote, according to the nonprofit news site. “I knew better, and I am sorry. I didn’t mean to upset anyone. The Interpretive Center at Heart Mountain has a great program for disseminating information and I learned a lot that day.”
The Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation issued a press release Thursday saying its members were “grateful for and accept” Winter’s apology.

“I believe that we are all good people and our goal at the Foundation is to educate one person at a time, if necessary, on what happened at our Heart Mountain site back in 1942,” Shirley Ann Higuchi, chair of the foundation’s board, said in a statement. Higuchi had called Winter’s remarks “unfortunate” and said it had left “a sour taste” in the mouths of those involved in hosting lawmakers to the museum that day. 
WyoFile first reported on Winter’s remarks Tuesday. The lawmaker, a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus who has served in the House since 2019, has not responded to multiple requests from WyoFile, including a voicemail Thursday inquiring about the apology.  
In his statement to AsAmNews, Winter echoed the remarks of his Senate cochairman Tim French, R-Powell, who told WyoFile on Tuesday that both men had grown up in the area, which was populated by World War II veterans who received lands previously held by the federal government as part of the internment center after the war. In their youth, people often referred to the facility by that name, particularly veterans still angry about the brutal Pacific front of the war, French said. But he said he personally had learned as he grew up that the slur was not appropriate. 
Though Winter said the words “just slipped out of my mouth,” video of the meeting shows him pausing before making the remark. Winter used the slur at the end of the day’s debate over agriculture and public land issues at Northwest Community College in Powell, while reminding his colleagues they’ve been invited to Heart Mountain afterward.
“If you’re gonna go to the,” Winter said, before pausing, “Jap camp, that’s what I call it, we need to leave here by about 12:30,” he said with a chuckle.

City officials said the public chargers — located at stations at the Warren Hood Building parking lot on the corner of Pearl Street and State Street, as well as Thalia Mara Hall and Union Station — are free to use for now but didn’t know for how long that would stay the case.
As of 2023, Mississippi had the fewest number of electric vehicles on the road per capita, based on registration data from the U.S. Department of Energy. DOE numbers also show Mississippi has the second fewest public charging stations per capita after Louisiana. 
In 2018, state lawmakers passed an annual fee of $150 for electric car owners and $75 for hybrid vehicles owners as a way of compensating for lost gas tax revenue. 
Below is a map of public charging stations in Jackson listed on the DOE’s website. Electric vehicle owners elsewhere in the state can use the agency’s online tool to find stations near them.
Entergy bought the chargers from Tesla, and the nonprofit Adopt a Charger installed the units through local contractor Lavallee, which will also maintain them for the city. Jackson’s Planning and Development Director Jhai Keeton said the city is paying just $600 a year for the chargers.
Adopt a Charger partners with private companies, in this case Entergy, who want to sponsor charging stations for public use. The nonprofit, according to its website, has also partnered on stations at the Mississippi Children’s Museum and at Hinds Community College in Raymond. 
While there were already several charging stations in Jackson, the ones unveiled Thursday are the first owned by the city. Prior to then, Tupelo had the most charging stations of any Mississippi city with 13, according to DOE data. Hattiesburg and Jackson, not including the new stations, each have 12, and there are 10 in both Biloxi and Gulfport. 
The Mississippi Department of Transportation is using $50 million in federal funds to develop electric vehicle corridors with 30 new stations throughout the state, but those projects are likely one to two years away.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/12161034/EV-charging-1.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Another proposal that specifically sought to raise taxes on millionaires, however, was rejected.
All of these were determined by a handful, or in some instances just one, vote. And with such narrow margins, the chambers will be unlikely to overcome a potential veto from Gov. Janet Mills, who has already expressed her opposition.
The advance of these tax changes comes amid the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee finalizing a budget plan to send to the Maine House of Representatives and Senate for approval, and the potential for increased tax revenue could be consequential.  
Advocates and some Democratic lawmakers specifically pushed for the Legislature to adjust taxes as a means to continue to fund the health and child care programs that Mills proposed cutting in her budget proposal.
So far, only some of those proposals have made it into the committee’s budget plan. Notably, the committee rejected Mills’ suggested cuts to childcare worker stipends and Head Start. Meanwhile, the committee included some initiatives to save or raise money, such as rolling back funding for mental health programs and pensions, as well as increasing the cigarette excise tax. 
A change to tax brackets 
Both chambers backed LD 229, which would increase the base of the state’s tax brackets. It would do this by both increasing the number of tax brackets and by adding a top tax bracket for high income earners.
Maine currently has three tax brackets with tax rates of 5.8%, 6.75% and 7.15%. The top tax bracket is currently for any individual making more than $61,600. The bill would add two more brackets for the highest earners, which would be taxed at 7.75% and 8.95%. 
In the Senate, several critics of the bill said that raising tax rates on the wealthiest individuals would drive investors away. Though tax committee co-chair Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock) said the state’s tax code is currently “upside down,” asking more proportionately from earners in the middle than those at the top. “This bill is here to fix that,” she said. 
The ideas in this bill are not new, and could lend themselves to a veto, again. 
Mills’ administration testified against the bill during its public hearing, reiterating many of the same concerns the governor had when she vetoed a bill last year that sought to adjust Maine’s tax bracelets by adding a new top tax rate of 8.45% and expanding the lower tax brackets. 
While describing the bill as well intentioned in her veto message, the governor said the bill wouldn’t reduce the tax burden for lower-income people because of the state’s many exemptions, deductions and credits that more people have become eligible for in recent years.
The governor also cited possible state budget challenges if Maine were to increase its reliance on a small number of taxpayers whose income is disproportionately composed of often volatile business. 
Raising taxes on corporations
The other bill both chambers backed is LD 1879, which would raise the tax rate on corporations to support the agricultural economy, though the Mills administration is also opposed to this plan.
Specifically, it would increase the top marginal corporate income tax rate to 10% on income over $3,500,000 for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2026. This revenue would then be distributed to various funds and programs, such as the dairy stabilization support fund, agricultural marketing loan fund and business recovery and resilience fund, among others.
Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy in the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, testified against the bill on behalf of Mills during the public hearing, noting that it would make Maine’s top marginal corporate income tax rate among the highest in the country. He also noted a number of technical concerns with the proposal. 
While both chambers have now passed LD 1879, it took several attempts for them to get on the same page.
While the House initially passed this bill 77-67, the Senate failed to pass it with a 13-18 vote and subsequently voted against it without a roll call, returning it to the lower chamber in nonconcurrence. 
On Wednesday, House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) tried to recede and concur but his motion failed 65-78. The House then insisted on its vote to pass the bill and the Senate tabled it when it was sent back to that body on Wednesday. 
But on Thursday the Senate changed course, voting 18-16 to recede and concur with the House. 
Rejecting a “millionaire’s tax”
Both chambers narrowly rejected what is commonly referred to as a “millionaire’s tax.” The proposal, LD 1089, was amended to a lower surcharge than initially proposed. 
It would place an income tax surcharge of 2% on the portion of a resident’s taxable income beyond $1 million for single filers, $1.5 million for heads of households and $2 million for married people filing jointly. This revenue would then go toward funding public K-12 education. 
Originally, the bill sought to tax income over $1 million by an additional 4%, which would have mirrored a law recently passed in Massachusetts.
The House failed to pass the measure 70-72 on Wednesday before voting against it without a roll call. The Senate ultimately did the same Thursday, after an initial vote to pass it failed 17-18.
The Mills administration has also testified against this bill.

BRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital has cut six administrative posts as it seeks $4 million in reductions and new revenue to balance its $119 million annual budget.
“Unfortunately, creating financial stability at times requires a reduction in force,” hospital President Christopher Dougherty said in an interview Thursday.
The day before, the hospital let go of its director of radiology, senior director of revenue cycle, data scientist, outpatient specialty practice manager and two executive assistants.
“They’re all administrative positions,” Dougherty said of the layoffs at one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers. “None of these are patient-facing positions.”
The hospital announced last month it was exploring 40 “strategies” to save or earn money by the end of its fiscal year Sept. 30. At the time, it listed options ranging from capitalizing on services such as its new MRI machine to continuing a hiring freeze that began April 1, to, at last resort, laying off some of its 520 staffers.

“We believe that we have some tremendous opportunities in enhancing our financial standing,” Dougherty said Thursday without elaborating.
But the hospital president couldn’t rule out more staff cuts.
“Our hopes are that we can avoid these reductions in force, but we certainly can’t guarantee that,” he said.
Brattleboro is relatively small among Vermont’s 14 community hospitals — it ranks eighth in the state for net patient revenue. Like the other hospitals, it is reliant on government reimbursement for Medicaid patients with limited incomes and Medicare patients age 65 or older. Both programs offer lower reimbursements than commercial insurance.
Last fall, the hospital asked the state’s Green Mountain Care Board, a key health system regulator, for a 4.7% increase in what it charges patients with commercial insurance. But the board instead capped any rise to no more than 3.4%, noting Brattleboro instead should reduce “system inefficiencies.”
“We did see an opportunity with some administrative positions to get our staffing in alignment with national benchmarks,” Dougherty said Thursday. “Six probably doesn’t sound like a lot, but they are six members of our community.”
Brattleboro so far is the only Vermont hospital to announce staff cuts this year, but it isn’t alone in wrestling with what the Green Mountain Care Board has called “a health care affordability crisis.”
“We’re committed to doing everything possible to create a sustainable future for the hospital,” Dougherty said. “I do think there’s hope that we are making progress in addressing our financial challenges, and we do have some opportunities to continue to accelerate that, short of reductions in force.”

Chellie Pingree said every state in the country would feel the impact of eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.“I rise today in strong opposition to the reckless attack on public media contained within this rescissions bill and millions of Americans who rely on and treasure their local public television and radio stations,” Pingree said.Efforts to defund CPB, she said, were the result of Trump’s “agenda against the free press and his authoritarian desire to control the media.”Public media would lose $1.1 billionThe seven-page bill would rescind all funding that Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, a total of $1.1 billion.CPB, which provides grants to public radio and television stations throughout the country, is one of the few programs that receives an advanced appropriation. So the funding elimination envisioned in the House bill would take effect starting on Oct. 1.The legislation revokes more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department or the U.S. Agency for International Development.Florida Republican Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said during an interview Wednesday there were extensive talks between GOP lawmakers and the Office of Management and Budget before the Trump administration officially submitted this rescissions request.But Díaz-Balart cautioned there would need to be substantial pre-negotiations ahead of any future rescissions requests for programs within his annual funding bill.“This rescission package — which I've had communication with OMB on — if this passes, we can move forward,” he said. “Now, if you're talking about a potential for future additional rescissions, that could potentially create a problem and tie the president's hands when it comes to dealing with adversaries or helping allies.”Díaz-Balart said that OMB officials hoping to make any additional rescissions requests on foreign aid would need to engage in “a level of coordination that is so detailed, so intense to make sure that nothing comes forward that could potentially hurt the president's ability to really do the America First agenda internationally.”Florida Democratic Rep. Lois Frankel, ranking member on the State-Foreign Operations spending panel, said during floor debate Thursday the bill was an attack on American values and posed a threat to national security.“It’s not charity, it's strategy,” Frankel said of foreign aid. “Don’t take my word for it, military leaders from both parties have warned us for years — if we fail to lead with soft power, we’ll end up paying in blood, bombs and more boots on the ground.”“Cutting foreign assistance will deepen desperation, fuel extremism, push fragile societies toward collapse and when that happens we all pay the price,” she added. “Refugee crises surge, diseases spread, trade routes shut down, our troops and diplomats face greater danger and our homeland security is weakened.”First of many requestsThe House vote took place just one week after the Trump administration sent lawmakers the rescissions request, the first of many proposals the White House budget office plans to submit. The $9.4 billion cancellation proposal represents a small fraction of the roughly $6.8 trillion the federal government spends each year.The recommendation said some of the foreign aid should be cancelled because it supported “programs that are antithetical to American interests and worsen the lives of women and children, like ‘family planning’ and ‘reproductive health,’ LGBTQI+ activities, and ‘equity’ programs.”The rescissions request allows the Office of Management and Budget to legally freeze funding on the programs listed for 45 days while lawmakers decide whether to approve the recommendation as is, amend it, or ignore it.The House and Senate must agree to approve the same rescissions bill before mid-July for the changes to take effect. Failure to reach a bicameral agreement before then would require the Trump administration to spend the funding and block the president from requesting the same cancellation for the rest of his term.Rescissions requests are rare since Congress typically negotiates spending levels on thousands of federal programs in the dozen annual spending bills that are then signed by the president.The first Trump administration proposed rescissions in 2018, but the bill never made it through the Senate.The last time Congress actually approved rescinding funding was in 1992 during the George H.W. Bush administration, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.More action in the SenateThe Senate will need to take up the bill before mid-July if it wants to approve any of the spending cuts, though several GOP senators told States Newsroom during brief interviews Wednesday ahead of the House vote they may amend the package, which would require it to go back to the House for final approval before the 45-day clock runs out.Rescissions bills come with a vote-a-rama in the Senate, giving Republicans and Democrats the chance to call up as many amendments as they want for a floor vote. The GOP holds a 53-member majority, so four or more Republicans opposing any element of the bill would likely lead to its removal.Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she will give the rescissions bill “careful consideration.”In a statement released earlier this month just after the White House sent the request to lawmakers, Collins wrote the committee would “carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations.”South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, said he’s mostly supportive of the rescissions request, though he didn’t rule out offering an amendment to restore full funding for the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, often called PEPFAR.“I think I'll be okay with most of it. I'm concerned about PEPFAR. I'll have to look at that,” Graham said.West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chairwoman of the spending panel that oversees the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, said she’s planning to evaluate the bill once it arrives.“We’ve got all these other things I’m thinking about. I haven’t even focused on it,” Capito said, referring to ongoing negotiations over the party’s “big, beautiful bill.”Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said she’s going to “try to” ensure the Corporation for Public Broadcasting keeps its funding.“I’m a supporter of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. It’s a lifeline for many of my small, rural communities,"" Murkowski saidKansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, a senior appropriator, said he’s “trying to figure out a strategy of how to deal with” both the foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting provisions once the bill comes over from the House.“I'm looking at both of them to see what the right outcome should be.”'The risk of living in a news desert'Both PBS and NPR released statements following the House vote, pledging to do their best to keep their funding intact.Katherine Maher, NPR president and CEO, wrote in a statement the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is essential to the organization.""Americans who rely on local, independent stations serving communities across America, especially in rural and underserved regions, will suffer the immediate consequences of this vote,"" Maher wrote. ""If rescission passes and local stations go dark, millions of Americans will no longer have access to locally owned, independent, nonprofit media and will bear the risk of living in a news desert, missing their emergency alerts, and hearing silence where classical, jazz and local artists currently play.”Paula Kerger, president and CEO at PBS, wrote in a separate statement the “fight to protect public media does not end with this vote, and we will continue to make the case for our essential service in the days and weeks to come.“If these cuts are finalized by the Senate, it will have a devastating impact on PBS and local member stations, particularly smaller and rural stations that rely on federal funding for a larger portion of their budgets. Without PBS and local member stations, Americans will lose unique local programming and emergency services in times of crisis.”",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

We don't shrink it."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)An Assembly committee approved a bill that would create a state counterpart to the federal Voting Rights Act in what supporters said was a bid to protect New Jersey’s democracy from growing federal assaults.
The measure would create a new independent office, housed in Treasury, to oversee elections where the voting rights or powers of racial and language minorities are limited. The Assembly Oversight, Reform, and Federal Relations Committee approved it Thursday in a 4-1 vote with an abstention from Assemblyman Michael Torrissi (R-Burlington).
“At a time when voting rights are under attack across the country, New Jersey must lead and continue to lead the way. This particular voter empowerment act … is our chance to send a clear message: Here, we expand Democracy. We don’t shrink it,” said Assemblyman Reginald Atkins (D-Union), the panel’s chair.
The bill would expand state courts’ power over elections, permitting them to change rules that violate the bill’s provisions, redraw voting districts, expand governing bodies, and move some election dates to coincide with higher-turnout state and federal races.
The bill would create preclearance rules at the state level, requiring localities with a history of voter suppression or intimidation to seek approval before enacting election rule changes, mirroring a provision of the federal Voting Rights Act the U.S. Supreme Court struck down in 2013.
Voting and civil rights groups broadly supported the bill, arguing the state needed its own protections amid escalating attacks from President Donald Trump and the waning strength of the federal law, which courts have repeatedly denuded since its enactment in 1965.
“In the past six months, we have seen attacks on voting rights at the federal level accelerate, including the Department of Justice dropping critical legal cases that aim to protect against racial discrimination in voting,” said Jesse Burns, executive director of the League of Women Voters of New Jersey. “We know that these threats are real, and we know that state-level VRAs are a powerful tool to curtail them.”
They praised a language-access provision that would require local officials to print translated election materials — including ballots, registration forms, and notices, among others — and assistance in languages other than English.
That requirement would kick in if at least 2%, or 4,000, of eligible voters speak a language other than English and have limited English proficiency. The federal law has a similar provision, but it sets a higher bar, requiring 5% of voting-age citizens with limited English proficiency before kicking in.
“New Jersey is home to over 2 million immigrants. One in four residents is an immigrant, 42.5% of whom are limited-English-proficient, but language access and expanded voted rights do not only impact them. 1.2 million New Jerseyans, regardless of citizenship status, are limited-English-proficient,” said Madison Linton, a fellow at the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice.
The New Jersey Association of Election Officials opposed the bill, questioning whether it was needed and cautioning it would give courts broad authority over election administration that, to now, had largely been left with election administrators.
Linda Hughes, the association’s recording secretary and Burlington County’s Republican Board of Elections administrator, warned such court intervention could leave various groups of voters with different election rules and cede some of the legislature’s authority to the judiciary.
“If a court determines that a disparity exists in voter turnout, vote outcomes, or even if they don’t approve of a party’s candidate selection, the judges — the individual judges — can then unilaterally change how those elections are run in certain jurisdictions throughout the state,” she said.
It was unclear how officials could identify discrimination based on a voter’s protected class — in the bill’s case, those in a racial or language minority group — given such information was not recorded on voter registrations, Hughes said.
Some witnesses urged the committee to expand the definition of protected class to include sexual orientation, gender identity, and criminal history.
Residents must provide notice to clerks asserting violations of the bill’s provisions. After receiving the notice, officials are guarded from lawsuits for up to 190 days while they work on fixes, which must be approved by the new voting rights office.
Hughes questioned whether there was even a need for the bill.
“This legislation seems to imply there are voters wanting to vote that are being prevented from participating … We just don’t have any evidence that that’s happening here in New Jersey, so this legislation does seem like it is a bit of a solution in search of a problem that doesn’t exist,” she said.
The New Jersey Institute for Social Justice identified 885 cases of voter intimidation, voter ID, registration, or polling access issues in the state between 2020 and 2024, said Nuzhat Chowdhury, director of its democracy and justice program.
Proponents argued much of the powers the bill, dubbed the John Lewis Voter Empowerment Act after the late Georgia congressman and civil rights leader, would grant to the courts were already available as remedies under the federal Voting Rights Act.
Assemblyman Mike Inganamort (R-Morris), the only lawmaker to vote against it in committee Thursday, largely echoed Hughes’ concerns about the bill. But he added his own reservations about the costs of language-access provisions and questioned reasoning behind leaving enforcement to the new Treasury office rather than the attorney general.
“The attorney general’s office provides counsel that is clear, timely, consistent, and free. That process works. Instead, this legislation calls for a new department, in the Department of Treasury of all places — I guess they have the desk space, I still don’t understand that aspect — that is going to be doing the job the attorney general already does,” Inganamort said.
Enforcement was moved away from the attorney general’s office because state lawyers advise election officials on legal matters, and requiring them to enforce the bill would create a conflict of interest, said Chowdhury.
The measure has not advanced in the Senate since it was introduced there last March.

As a first-generation, low-income student, she needed substantial assistance to be able to attend college. She said the aid she gets from Yale covers 90% of her tuition and expenses. But she fears the changes under a federal tax bill, for higher education institutions and the funds that support financial aid, could put her into debt her senior year.
“I always say that the moment I opened my college acceptance letter changed my life,” she said. “But the reality is that the moment that really changed my life was when I opened my financial aid award.”
One by one, as they spoke outside of the U.S. Capitol, students from Connecticut and elsewhere spoke about how financial aid helped them achieve the dream of going to college without being saddled with massive debt when they graduate.
Connecticut students took the lead in organizing the trip to D.C. to share their stories and meet with U.S. senators who are actively considering and making some changes to President Donald J. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The trip came together pretty quickly, and 10 days ago, they reached out to office of U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., to hold a press conference.
For many of the students who traveled to D.C. this week, they are able to attend college with little expenses because of their schools’ generous financial aid, plus federal student loan programs. Much of that aid is funded by college and university endowments. Yale has one of the largest university endowments, and the current changes in the GOP tax bill could cost the school an estimated $690 million a year.
Emi Glass said Pell Grants, outside scholarship and financial aid from Yale helped her attend college and pursue opportunities like study abroad and an unpaid government internship over the summer “without fear of debt.”
And for Cayla Waddington, she said she needed to aim for an Ivy League school because she would get more financial support from wealthier institutions. The rising sophomore at Yale from West Philadelphia didn’t qualify for enough financial aid at other colleges and would still end up owing at least $30,000.
“I knew my only chance at being able to afford college was to go to a school that had enough money and resources to support me on its own,” Waddington said. “Now, I pay next to nothing for my Yale education, thanks to their endowment. This story isn’t unique to me, and it’s not unique to Yale. There are thousands of us from across the country who share the same story.”
The legislation includes a number of higher education provisions, including changes to student loans and financial assistance.
Since taking office, Trump has sought to reshape the higher education landscape. House Republicans on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee argued that the bill “holds woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations and other tax-exempt entities accountable, ensuring they can no longer abuse generous benefits provided through the tax code.”
The House-passed bill proposes raising the endowment tax from 1.4% to 21%. While it’s a tiered system and the number will vary by school, Yale is one of the wealthier private institutions that would likely face the highest tax rate.
The Yale students in D.C. on Thursday credited the university’s endowment with providing them with substantial financial aid. Yale provides free tuition for students from households that make under $150,000 a year.
Shortly after the House passed the bill, Yale President Maurie McInnis sent a message to everyone at the school to get involved and call on the Senate to reconsider the hike in the endowment tax. She noted that Yale’s endowment makes up a third of the school’s total revenue and helps provide financial aid — and supports research and some faculty as well.
The federal legislation also seeks cutting or paring back student loan options.
Pell Grant recipients who want to get the maximum amount need to be full-time students. Under the bill, students would need to increase the number of credits they take each semester from 12 to 15 to reach that status. They need to be half-time students to get at least some assistance. But it would also expand these grants in other cases by making short-term vocational training eligible for Pell.
The bill would also reduce the number of existing income-driven repayment plans to pay back student loans and get rid of federal subsidized loans for undergraduates.
Some students worried what the elimination of federal subsidized loans would mean for them if that provision goes into effect in July 2026.
Rebeckah Rubin graduated a few weeks ago from Eastern Connecticut State University and will attend New England Law in Boston in August. She was able to get her degree by relying on subsidized loans and Direct PLUS loans. She warned of “misleading and predatory” private student loan lenders taking advantage of students, especially those who are first-generation.
For the past two days, the group of students has been trying to meet with members of Congress in both parties to lobby against the bill’s higher education provisions. Zach Pan, one of the organizers from Yale, said they reached out to a dozen Republican offices, noting that one student had a meeting with one GOP senator.
Getchell said a group of 25 students went to meetings on Thursday around Capitol Hill. Some of the Connecticut contingent includes at least eight students from Yale as well as some from the University of Connecticut and Eastern Connecticut State University. 
When organizing the visit, she said, the group worked with Yale’s Office of Federal Affairs. The university will also help cover some students’ travel expenses.
Beyond efforts to meet with members of Congress this week, the students said they will be seeking to publish op-eds in local newspapers to bring attention to measures like the endowment tax.
At Thursday’s press conference, Blumenthal, who was joined by U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D-4th District, said many of the aspects of the bill that face changes were once supported by both Democrats and Republicans.
“It will cap federal student aid and eliminate subsidized loan options that prevent interest from accruing while you’re in school, and when you graduate, it will force you spend more of your income on loan payments,” Blumenthal said. “This reconciliation bill is a dream killer, a job killer, a school killer.”
The House passed the wide-ranging legislation along party lines in late May, and the Senate is now negotiating and drafting its own version.
Because the Senate is likely to make changes, Republicans in both chambers will likely need to reconcile the differences and vote on a compromise bill. The Senate is actively making revisions to some parts of the legislation, including the education piece of it.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_4751-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

A virtual public meeting hosted Wednesday evening by the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont was sparsely attended. But the dozen or so people who logged on had plenty to say.
Small schools matter and bring value to their communities, one Twinfield Union School staff member said. Another attendee said school choice should not be expanded. And most said the proposed transformation of public education in Vermont — the outlines of which key lawmakers are debating this week at the Statehouse in Montpelier —  is happening far too quickly, and without much input from the public.
“I just don’t see how, at this time, we should be rushing through a process to make the governor happy, and the (Agency of Education) happy, and the Senate happy, and the House happy, when they haven’t really consulted with the people in the field,” Keri Bristow, the chair of central Vermont’s Mountain Views Supervisory Union board, said during the meeting. 
“I do not think that what’s going through right now is in any way equitable,” Bristow said. “I think it will be a huge detriment to the public school system.”
Wednesday night’s listening session was the final meeting in a series of five that a consultant hired by the commission has held over the last two months. The meeting capped efforts by the commission to gather public opinion about what Vermont’s public education system should look like, at least until it gets more direction from the Legislature.
The creation of the Commission on the Future of Public Education in Vermont was part of 2024’s Act 183, the law that set the double-digit average property tax increases needed that year to keep pace with ballooning public education costs.
The law gave members of the 13-member body, composed of lawmakers and education officials, a wide-ranging charge. Among other things, they were tasked with studying Vermont’s public education system and making recommendations to reduce costs while ensuring equal educational opportunities are afforded to all students, with a final report due in December 2025.
But since its first meeting in August 2024, the commission has lacked buy-in from all sides of the political spectrum, several of its members said. 
Some commission members haven’t shown up to meetings in months, according to commission members and meeting minutes. And after Gov. Phill Scott introduced his sweeping education reform plan in January, the commission struggled to find a role for itself.
“It is relevant that the commission was created in a law that was vetoed and then ultimately overridden. That is relevant to, I think, where we find ourselves,” Meagan Roy, the chair of the commission, said in an interview.
Now, as education reform proceeds, with only minor input from the body, the future of the commission tasked with studying the future of public education in Vermont is, itself, uncertain.
Jay Nichols, the executive director of the Vermont Principals Association and a member of the commission, said, “I feel a little bit like we’ve been floundering.”

‘Up in the air’
The commission delivered its preliminary findings on how to rein in public education costs in December. But the group shied away from offering specific recommendations on how to contain costs in the short term.
The document offered an assessment of the situation facing public education in Vermont, along with some key education data trends. Roy, a former superintendent, said in an interview that there were commission members who were disappointed that the report did not have cost containment recommendations. But she noted that the report found the issue was “more complicated than short-term cost containment.
“We really aren’t going to make wise decisions by focusing on the short term,” she said.
A month after the commission’s report was shared, Scott released his sweeping reform plan, calling for the consolidation of Vermont’s 119 school districts down to as few as five regional administrative districts.
“That pretty much changed everything, because at that point, the commission and everybody else was responding to the governor’s plan,” Nichols said, adding that he felt the commission was “bypassed” by Scott’s proposed timeline.
Since then, the commission has turned its focus toward a public engagement campaign. The commission began holding meetings for public input around the state, and later hired Afton Partners, a consulting group, to host virtual listening sessions and to gather the input provided for the commission and lawmakers. The group has so far been paid $24,375 for its work, according to Toren Ballard, a spokesperson for the state Agency of Education.
“At every meeting, we have citizens that come up and say things like, ‘Please keep this commission going, because it’s one place we feel like we can really be heard,'” Nichols said. “But until final legislation is settled on between the House and Senate and the governor… I mean, we could end up with not having a commission. And there’s several of us that have said publicly, including myself, that I don’t want to be part of a commission unless it’s doing real work.”
Peter Conlon, the House Education Committee chair who is part of the legislative negotiations and a sitting member of the commission, said his hope moving forward is that “we can better focus” the commission’s public outreach campaign “to provide really good public information to the Legislature come January.”
“The Legislature, which created the commission to begin with, would be best served by the commission really capitalizing on its outreach in terms of, what do Vermonters think of this new vision of Vermont, how it should operate, how it can best serve Vermonters,” he said in an interview.
The committee by law is scheduled to release a final report with recommendations for public education reform by December. But that has been difficult to home in on, Conlon said, because the commission’s future role “has been very much up in the air.”
In the current version of H.454 proposed by the House members, the commission remains, but lawmakers have refined its focus to address “the state of future larger districts, the role of school boards in those future larger districts, and the role of the electorate,” Conlon said while introducing that section to the conference committee on Wednesday.
The bill finalized by the conference committee would go to the full Legislature for a vote and then to Scott for his approval.

Low turnout 
Nichols and others admit that the commission has “not had strong turnout” for the in-person and virtual engagement sessions. A presentation by Afton Partners reported that only 18 people had attended the four listening sessions in May.
“It worries me. I think that a lot of the public doesn’t have any clue of what’s going on in the Legislature,” Nichols said.
Roy, in an interview, said the commission struggled with whether to host the virtual sessions at all. 
“Eventually, what the commission decided is that the optics aren’t good for us to talk for months about how important engagement is and then cancel the input sessions. It just didn’t feel right,” she said.
She added that the commission is still pursuing public engagement. “But we’re trying to be honest with participants,” she said. “‘You are informing us as the commission. You’re not necessarily informing the Legislature right now.'”
Conlon in an interview acknowledged the commission’s public sessions “have not been as well publicized as we would like.”
“But we have a lot of time left on the calendar, and once the commission gets settled as to whether it’s continuing with its current statutory framework, or if it’s moving ahead in a new statutory framework, that will help guide that work,” he said.
Roy said the commission remains an important tool for ensuring education reform is done thoughtfully.
“I think the commission is needed more than ever to do this work,” she said. Other states that have undergone systematic transformation, she said, “created a body to monitor how successful it’s been. That’s what I think our role should be.”

June 7, 2025 | Photo by Jon KingState regulators are seeking more information on the impacts of the proposed routes on two transmission line expansion projects that would place many miles of electric service wires across the state.
ITC Holding Corp., doing business as the Michigan Electric Transmission Company, plans to build two approximately 50 mile spans of high-voltage electric transmission lines, one from the Indiana border starting in Branch County to a substation in Calhoun County, and the other stretching from Eaton County to Gratiot County. 
The projects were proposed in 2022 and are slated to cost nearly $850 million. They have been hailed by supporters as some of the first transmission line projects approved by MISO, a midwestern power grid operator, which could help bolster Michigan’s electric grid.
But the situation has some residents grappling with the possibility of an electricity rate increase that could affect all Michiganders, as well as concerns that their land might be seized in the process.
For now, those residents were given somewhat of a reprieve as the Michigan Public Service Commission on Thursday asked for additional briefings on the proposed routes.

The company in 2024 applied for certificates of public convenience and necessity on the projects, which were up for discussion at Thursday’s meeting.
Commissioners noted evidence showing the company’s proposed route between Branch and Calhoun counties runs through a rural airport, although an alternative proposed route sidesteps the airport but requires more new right-of-way allowance.
Members of the commission asked for supplemental briefs on the reasonableness of the route’s impact on the airport and the overall social impacts of the proposed alternative route.
Those briefs are due back to the commission June 26.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, the company said it will continue to work with the commission on the certificates.
“These Tranche 1 projects are part of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, Long-Range Transmission Plan, or LRTP, which will improve grid reliability and resiliency, support state economic development efforts and enable the safe and reliable movement of power to Michigan communities,” the company said. “ITC looks forward to continuing our work with agencies, municipalities and landowners.”
Community members who would be affected by the transmission lines spoke in opposition to the project during public comment at the end of the meeting.
Robert Williams, the owner of the airport in question, said the proposed lines go directly across his rural airfield located just south of Marshall. He said he has been in contact with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and that the agency is pursuing his concerns about an electric transmission line running across a federally-registered airport.
The team is investigating if an alternative route is available to the [the company],” Williams said. “[A proposed alternative] does not change the entire route. It only changes a small section.”
Williams added that, in his conversation with federal regulators, the subject of burying the transmission lines was discussed and said it could be done.
“That is a precedent that’s been set before the varied transmission lines up to 720,000 volts,” Williams said. “These are 345,000 volts.”
Peter Sullivan also commented on the project. His mother, Margot Sullivan, lives in Fowler and owns 80 acres of centennial farmland in a section of the proposed route.
Although the commission did not approve the project and sought additional information on Thursday, Sullivan said he and others will continue to demand that the company move the overall right-of-way from properties in the proposed route by 50 feet. He said their demands also include the company not using virgin land to make new easements or rights-of-way and instead use existing rights-of-way.
Union City resident Jake Wages said he hopes the commission would not approve the project after getting additional information based on the number of centennial farms and agricultural farms that are in the way of the proposed route. Wages claimed that the company has not been transparent with residents. He said he has had numerous conversations with those potentially affected by the lines in Branch and Calhoun counties and that not one of them has said they agreed to terms with the company on giving up their land.
“The contract is so lopsided that anybody with any common sense wouldn’t even consider signing it,” Wages said. “They want to put in there that any equipment that is on our property belongs to them, and if something happens to it, we’re liable for it. At that point, who’s liable for any contamination? We’re responsible for their vehicles, their maintenance, cleaning up their mess. They want access to our property [around the clock] without any type of notification.”

,DC,2025-06-12 20:42:22+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Small business owners from rural America urge Congress to keep clean energy tax credits,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/small-business-owners-rural-america-urge-congress-keep-clean-energy-tax-credits,,"WASHINGTON — Small business owners and community leaders from rural regions in Western states including Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah pressed lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week to preserve clean energy tax credits on the chopping block in the Republicans’ “one big beautiful” mega-bill, now in the Senate.The suite of investment, production and residential tax credits enacted and expanded under the Democrats’ own big budget reconciliation bill in 2022, titled the “Inflation Reduction Act,” incentivized homeowners, car buyers, energy producers and manufacturers to invest in types of energy beyond fossil fuels, with the aim of reducing the effects of climate change.The credits have spurred hundreds of billions in investment dollars in advanced manufacturing and production since 2022, and contributed to job creation, largely in states that elected President Donald Trump to a second term.Small business operators and community leaders from rural and mountainous areas of the United States that have benefited from the boom in alternative energy sources say the campaign to end the tax credits will also cause job losses and cut options for consumers.Solar projects in AlaskaChase Christie, director of development for Alaska Solar LLC, said his company installs four to five large-scale solar projects per year in remote Alaskan villages and also fits and services smaller residential solar installations.“They take a lot of planning, a lot of logistics,” Christie told States Newsroom in an interview Wednesday.“For going into a remote village where there's tundra, we might need to go there in the dead of winter so we can work on frozen ground,” he added. “Other places we won't go until summer. So we have these large gaps in between these larger projects, and a company like ours absolutely relies on the residential installations to keep our workforce going.”Christie, who met Tuesday with staffers for Alaska’s Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, said in January he let a handful of workers go and paused most new hiring.“Our workforce is roughly half of what it usually is just because we're not sure which direction things are going to go,” he said.Christie was among a dozen small energy business owners, municipal government officials and nonprofit employees focused on energy options for low-income households who States Newsroom spoke to Wednesday.A spokesperson for Sullivan said in a statement: “Senator Sullivan supports energy projects that lower costs for Alaska. The Senator and his team have been meeting with a number of Alaskans about energy tax credits. As we wait for text from the Senate Finance Committee, the Senator is working with his colleagues to ensure that the bill strikes the right balance between promoting stable and predictable tax policy, advancing projects that benefit Alaska, and addressing the need to reduce the federal deficit.”Murkowski’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Elimination of tax creditsSenators are hashing out language for the massive Republican agenda bill that will extend and expand the 2017 tax law, costing roughly $3.8 trillion, and cut spending in other areas to offset the price tag.A contingent of House Republicans, who have dubbed the tax credits the “green new scam,” won on accelerating the expiration of the energy tax credits and tightening restrictions on eligibility as a way to pay for individual and corporate tax cuts that Trump campaigned on.The language in a section of the House bill, passed 215-214 on May 22, titled “Working Families Over Elites,” terminates the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit, worth up to $3,200 for homeowners who make energy upgrades to their property.Among the slate of other affected IRA tax credits, the House bill also speeds up the expiration of the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, a credit dating back decades that was updated in 2022.The credit is available to taxpayers who invest in “energy property,” including solar installations to provide electricity and heat, fuel cells, small wind turbines, geothermal pumps, and other electricity-producing technologies. House Republicans wrote provisions to eliminate the credit for facilities placed into service after 2028 and end eligibility for projects that don’t begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s enactment.The credit is worth up to 30% of the cost of the project, plus two bonus credits up to 10% each if the project includes mostly domestically produced material and if it’s located in an “energy community,” meaning a place where a coal plant has closed or where unemployment reaches a certain threshold.The bill also repeals a taxpayer’s ability to transfer the tax credits as a way to finance a project, and introduces restrictions on foreign-made components that industry professionals say essentially makes the credit unworkable.Critics point to the cost of the tax credits.The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated, as of June 4, the elimination of the clean energy investment and production tax credits will save roughly $249 billion over the next decade.Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a right-of-center think tank that advocates for lower taxes, said Thursday in a new analysis that “The final House bill makes impressive cuts to the IRA green energy tax credits, but it does so in part by introducing more complexity.”The group is advocating for senators to reduce the tax credit rates and make clearer complicated language, like the provision around “foreign entities of concern.”Keeping on the heat during a Montana winterBut Logan Smith, weatherization program manager for the Human Resource Development Council in central Montana, argues the credits have been a lifeline for lower-income rural residents.“If I can get solar panels on each of the clients’ homes, that means that their power is going to stay on in the middle of winter,” Smith said. “Because every winter we plan for losing power for about a week, that's just something we grew up with. … But if we have solar panels, the power stays on, the heat stays on.”Ralph Waters, owner of SBS Solar in Missoula, Montana, became emotional when talking about how an early termination of the tax credits could slow his business and result in having to lay off half his workforce.He criticized the politicization of the tax incentives.“Montana is deeply red, but it's also a very practical place. And so green energy renewables becomes a taboo phrase somehow,” Waters said. “The practical energy needs are undeniable, and so if we can get past our disagreements about the phraseology and realize that it's electrons, watts, and amps. And it’s cheaper.”The offices of Montana GOP Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy did not respond to a request for comment.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana voters will get to weigh in next on whether civil service protections should be removed from certain state employees, though it’s not certain the measure will result in current government workers losing their status. 
Senate Bill 8, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris. R-West Monroe, received final passage Wednesday in the Senate on a 28-9 party-line vote. 
The proposal is a constitutional amendment that will be placed on a ballot April 18, 2026, pending approval of a separate bill to set that election date. 
Morris’ bill would give state lawmakers power that currently rests with the Civil Service Commission, a seven-member independent review panel that oversees the hiring, promotion and firing of 39,000 “classified” state workers. The commission, working with state agencies on staffing goals, has the power to create and eliminate job positions and decide which jobs should have a protected status and which should not. 
Classified employees enjoy some degree of protection against politically motivated or otherwise unfair terminations and disciplinary practices because they have the right to appeal such decisions to the Civil Service Commission, which has the final say on staffing matters for most state agencies. 
Although there was debate and confusion earlier in the week over whether the bill would apply to current classified employees or just future-hires, Morris said in an interview Thursday it could affect current employees “to a degree.”
“Obviously, it can affect future employees. That’s obvious,” he said. “But it can affect existing employees.”
The degree to which it will affect current employees would depend on how the Legislature decides to use the amendment if voters adopt it. Morris said lawmakers would still need to pass a new statute that contains those specifics.  
“Any bill passed would have to be carefully constructed to avoid any issues of an unconstitutional taking” of an existing employee’s job, he said.
Steven Procopio, president of the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana (PAR), a state government watchdog group, said the amendment would give lawmakers power to determine which state employees should be removed from classified civil service. 
Whether they choose to take it that far remains to be seen, he said.
“Does it affect current employees?” Procopio said. “I think it’s technically possible. You can do it, but there has to be due process applied.”
There is a legal precedent from a court case that could require some level of due process before currently classified employees can be fired, he added.
“PAR is for civil service reforms, but I am concerned this doesn’t provide enough safeguards,” Procopio said.
At any rate, the matter could end up in court before the election over the proposal’s ballot language, which does not mention the “classified” civil service and could mislead voters into thinking it doesn’t apply to those workers. 
The ballot language states: “Do you support an amendment to allow the legislature to remove or add officers, positions, and employees to the unclassified civil service?”
Lawmakers based the ballot language off of a current constitutional provision that states: “Additional positions may be added to the unclassified service and those positions may be revoked by rules adopted by a commission.”
All state employees are classified unless their job falls under one of the 13 unclassified positions listed in the Louisiana Constitution. 
“I think that the ballot language could be misleading,” Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, said, noting that the state constitution specifically allows for legal challenges in such situations.

President Donald Trump has ordered one of the nation’s largest-ever military parades to take place in Washington, D.C., this weekend, coinciding with Flag Day and his own 79th birthday. In response, the grassroots anti-Trump 50501 movement has planned protests across the nation. 
In Vermont, Saturday’s events include a border-to-border anti-Trump flag parade that plans to travel up Route 7 from Massachusetts to Canada, allowing Vermonters on the route to honk and wave as the parade passes by. At least 15 communities outside of the parade route are planning their own anti-Trump protests. 
Some rallies have special activities planned along with the protests. In Middlebury, St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church plans to conduct a dramatic reading of the one-act play “Paul Revere Resists.” In Charlotte, protesters are invited to hike to the top of Mount Philo to display their signs and flags at the summit.

At least one pro-Trump event has been announced so far. The Vermont Republican Party has listed a “Celebration of Flag day, Army’s 250’s Anniversary & Birthday” on its website, to take place at the Statehouse lawn in Montpelier — the same location as the city’s 50501’s anti-Trump rally.

Jim Justice (R-WV) speaks to reporters at the U.S. Capitol on March 25, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch | Getty Images)As legislation cutting a food assistance program that helps feed thousands of state residents makes its way through Congress, several advocacy groups, businesses and organizations are calling on West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice to speak against the plan. 
“Given that SNAP is the most effective anti-hunger program in the state, we ask that you oppose structural changes, cuts and efforts to weaken SNAP,” an open letter to Justice reads. “Cutting SNAP would have devastating consequences for the 278,978 children, parents, older adults, veterans, people with disabilities and others in our state who rely on the program to keep hunger at bay.
“The research is clear: SNAP improves health outcomes, reduces child hospitalizations and developmental delays and supports educational success. It also decreases health care spending and helps stabilize families during times of crisis and job loss,” they wrote.
The letter from the American Friends Service Committee Wednesday is signed by nearly 60 West Virginia food banks, small businesses, congregations and organizations.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last month that would cut the Supplemental Food Nutrition Program by $300 billion through 2034 and push a portion of the cost of the program to the states to backfill. The program currently is funded solely by the federal government. States split the cost of administering the program with the federal government.
The Senate Agriculture Committee, of which Justice is a member, this week took up its portion of the Republican tax and budget reconciliation legislation. The bill has yet to be voted on by the full Senate. If the Senate passes the bill, the House of Representatives would need to sign off on any changes the Senate makes.
The latest version of the legislation would still push some of the cost of SNAP onto the states, but would penalize states less harshly than the version the House of Representatives passed last month.  
Under the House bill, the federal government would shift between 5 to 25% of the cost of SNAP benefits to state governments beginning in 2028 depending on their payment error rate. That version of the bill could put West Virginia on the hook for $28 million and up to about $141 million, depending on the state’s error rate. 
In the Senate Agriculture Committee’s version, most states would be required to pay between 5 and 15% of the food benefits program beginning in 2028. Only those with an error rate of 6% would have to pay for the program, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
The Senate proposal would have West Virginia paying up to $84 million, according to the analysis. 
“The cuts and cost shifts in the House bill would lead to greater food insecurity and place even greater pressure on our food banks and charities, which already struggle to meet demand,” the letter says. “For every one meal provided by a food bank, SNAP provides nine. Our state’s charitable food system cannot fill the gap that would be created by the magnitude of these cuts.”
Justice this week told a reporter that cutting SNAP could cost Republicans’ their supermajority. 
“If we don’t watch out, people are going to get hurt, people are going to be upset. It’s going to be the No.1 thing on the nightly news all over the place,” Justice said in an interview with Politico Tuesday. “And then, we could very well awaken to a situation in this country where the majority quickly becomes the minority.”
When a West Virginia Watch reporter asked a Justice spokesman for comment on the letter, he referred her to Justice’s comments to Politico. 
The Senate bill also makes changes to the work requirement exceptions. Historically, SNAP recipients with children have not been subject to work requirements for the program. The House version of the bill expanded work requirements to parents of children age 7 and up. In the Senate version, parents of children age 10 and up are subject to the requirements, said Kelly Allen, director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. 
The Senate bill also gets rid of work requirement exemptions for people including veterans, homeless people and gives states more flexibility to issue exemptions on a case by case basis, Allen said. 
Overall, the Senate agriculture committee is just “tinkering around the edges” with the bill that passed in the House last month, Allen said.
“It’s still the largest cut to SNAP in history,” she said. “It’s still a dramatic expansion of bureaucratic barriers that will result in people losing food assistance, including households with children. And it still abandons that commitment to federally funding SNAP benefits and likely creates pretty significant burden for state lawmakers in the state budget at a time when the state budget is already crunched.”

Dan McKee said in a statement Wednesday. “We know there is still much work ahead, but the steps we are taking are […]","Publicly-accessible Boxes containing Naloxone, an opioid reversal drug also known by the brand name Narcan, line up outside the East Bay Recovery Center in Warren. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island saw its lowest number of fatal drug overdoses since 2020, according to health department data presented to the Governor’s Overdose Task Force on Wednesday.
“This is a sign of hope,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement Wednesday. “We know there is still much work ahead, but the steps we are taking are saving lives.” 
This is the second year in a row that overdose deaths have dropped. There were 329 Rhode Islanders who died from overdoses in 2024, representing an 18.6% decrease from 2023, and a 25% drop compared to 2022. That means the state is well on its way to achieving its goal of a 30% reduction for 2030. The goal was set in 2022, the year a total of 436 people died of drug overdoses.  
The 2024 data demonstrated another longstanding trend now broken: For the first time since 2013, cocaine-related deaths were implicated in 61% of fatal overdoses, surpassing the 57% of deaths associated with fentanyl. 
All opioid-related overdoses, in fact, fell from 85% the previous year to 69% in 2024.
But more than one substance can contribute to an overdose, so distinguishing the role of cocaine or fentanyl in a death is not so neatly accomplished. A large portion of overdoses — 118 in all — involved both substances being used in tandem in 2024. About three in five people who died from cocaine also had fentanyl in their system.   
The annual overdose data is compiled and interpreted by the Rhode Island Department of Health’s (RIDOH) Substance Use Epidemiology Program, which finished reviewing the 2024 results last week, according to Joseph Wendelken, a department spokesperson. 
The data is largely based on autopsy and toxicology findings from the Office of the State Medical Examiners. Personal medical history also informs the coroners’ findings. The data does not include deaths with undetermined causes.
“Though decline is encouraging, this is still an incredible loss in our community,” Heidi Weidele, the health department’s lead fatal overdose epidemiologist, told the task force Wednesday during her presentation on the data.
  A slide from the Rhode Island Department of Health’s presentation on fatal overdoses in 2024 shows trends since 2009. (Rhode Island Department of Health)
The scale of loss did not affect all people equally: 70% of overdose deaths in 2024 were men, a number consistent with recent years. Similarly, people ages 45 to 54 were the largest age-based cohort of overdose deaths, followed by people ages 55 to 64.
By race, non-Hispanic white Rhode Islanders comprised the largest share of overdoses at 73%, even though they were also most likely to have a history of substance use treatment.
Most of the state’s overdoses were concentrated in urban areas, with Woonsocket, Providence and Pawtucket reporting the highest numbers.










Though decline is encouraging, this is still an incredible loss in our community. 


– Heidi Weidele, lead fatal overdose epidemiologist, Rhode Island Department of Health


Weidele said the deceased most commonly worked in “natural resources, construction, maintenance, and service occupations, which is similar to what we’ve seen in past years,” she told the task force. “And service occupations would be things like health care support, law enforcement, food preparation, grounds maintenance, and personal care.”
Other statistics from the report painted a grim picture of the deceased leading up to final moments: Most never sought substance use treatment, or received medical treatment for a previous overdose. 
Eight out of 10 died in private, in a home, garage or camper. Most overdosed alone, with no bystander present in 60% of cases.
Illicit and prescription drugs
The availability of lethal drugs has also influenced overdose trends over the years. In 2009, prescription drugs accounted for 62% of overdose deaths. By 2020, prescription drugs accounted for only 9% of fatal overdoses, while illicit drugs like fentanyl and cocaine comprised 72% of overdose deaths.
In 2024, the state actually saw 34% of deaths attributed to combinations of illicit and prescription drugs combined — the highest percentage since at least 2009.
A few uncommon culprits in overdose deaths were still marked as “substances of concern” by the state health department. These included novel benzodiazepines, tranquilizers which belong to the much broader category of research chemicals — substances derived from or chemically very similar to legal and regulated drugs. In this case, novel benzodiazepines like clonazolam — about two-and-a-half-times stronger than Xanax — accounted for nine fatalities in 2024.
Brown University researcher: Street drugs are getting more potent and more mysterious

Xylazine, a veterinary anesthetic increasingly being used to cut street-sourced opioids, was another rogue substance that continued to impact overdose data in 2024. It was involved in 37% of opioid-related deaths.
“Every single overdose death is preventable,” Health Department Director Dr. Jerry Larkin said in a statement Wednesday. “Recovery is within reach for every person living with the disease of addiction.”
McKee strengthened the Overdose Task Force — a coalition of more than 150 members divvied up into nine workgroups — in 2022 via an executive order, hoping to ensure a sustained state response to the opioid overdose crisis. Among the initiatives it steers are determining how to dispense opioid settlement funds, naloxone distribution networks, peer outreach, and recovery support and public awareness campaigns. 
Earlier this year, Rhode Island also opened the nation’s first state-regulated harm reduction site at Project Weber/RENEW in south Providence, where people can use drugs and receive medical attention in the event of an overdose. Despite a fierce floor debate in the Rhode Island House of Representatives, legislation to extend the injection site’s pilot authorization was extended by the General Assembly and later signed into law by McKee on June 6.

(Photo courtesy of Raise the Wage Oklahoma)OKLAHOMA CITY – Legal challenges were filed Wednesday aimed at a recent law that puts more restrictions on the process voters use to get issues on the ballot.
The suits were filed with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
Gov. Kevin Stitt in May signed Senate Bill 1027, which took effect immediately.
The new law requires those circulating a petition for a statutory change to get signatures that amount to no more than 11.5% of the votes cast in a single county in the most recent gubernatorial election. The threshold increases to 20.8% for a constitutional amendment.
The law effectively forces signature gatherers to visit several Oklahoma counties rather than concentrating on high-population areas.
Prior to the law, there were no restrictions or caps on signatures from any county.
Under the new law, those seeking to place items on the ballot would be prohibited from paying petition circulators based on the number of signatures collected. The law requires sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bars out-of-state interests from donating.
Petition circulators would have to be registered voters.
It requires a political appointee, the Secretary of State, to approve the gist, which is the brief summary of the ballot measure that voters see at the top of the signature sheet.
One suit challenges the overall constitutionality of the law, saying it imposes an undue burden.
The suit seeks to put the law on hold until the legal dispute is resolved.
It says the law effectively nullifies “the right of the initiative petition” and violates the First Amendment.
It slashes the available signature pool by 95%, “making ballot qualification virtually impossible while advancing no legitimate state interest,” the suit said.
The suit was filed by two proponents of State Question 836, which seeks to make Oklahoma primaries open. A rural voter and a member of a group that has been highly critical of plans to build a turnpike in the Norman area also are plaintiffs.
Secretary of State Josh Cockroft and Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond as defendants in both suits.
The second suit challenges the ability to make the law retroactive.
A petition seeking to open the state’s primaries, State Question 836, is already in the works and was filed before the measure became law. 
“This law doesn’t just bend the rules in favor of powerful politicians — it breaks them entirely for Oklahoma voters,” said Dr. Ken Setter, a plaintiff in both suits and proponent of State Question 836. “Oklahoma’s Constitution gives us the right to petition our government. Senate Bill 1027 strips that right away.”
The new law gives the executive branch veto power over citizen initiatives, the suit said.
The measure makes it more difficult and costly to get an issue on the ballot and would deter future efforts, the suit said.
When State Question 836 was filed, there were no geographic requirements for signatures and no caps, the suit said.
“Retroactive application of SB 1027 substantially undercuts Oklahoma citizens’ ability to exercise their reserved right of initiative petition,” the suit says. 
The initiative petition process has been used to expand Medicaid, enact criminal justice reform and legalize medical marijuana.
Lawmakers have repeatedly declined to expand Medicaid or legalize medical marijuna.
Supporters of the new law have said it is needed to garner more input from rural counties and to prevent fraud.

California Insurance Department formally investigating State Farm over ‘significant’ number of complaints about its handling of claims from L.A. fire survivors.


California’s Insurance Department has launched a formal investigation into State Farm over its handling of claims from the Los Angeles County fires. 
The investigation, expected to take months, will allow for a more comprehensive regulatory review, the department said in a press release today. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in the release that the review will help determine whether State Farm has complied with the state’s consumer-protection and claims-handling laws.
“No one should be left in uncertainty, forced to fight for what they are owed, or face endless delays that often lead consumers to give up,” Lara said.
Survivors of the January fires and lawmakers who represent them had urged the commissioner to open the investigation into the state’s largest provider of property insurance. 
Residents of Pasadena and Altadena have complained about delays in payments; being assigned multiple claims adjusters; having to fight to be reimbursed for smoke damage; and more. His staff will also investigate inconsistent management of similar claims and poor record-keeping, Lara said. 
“I’m happy to hear the commissioner has chosen to look deeper,” said Andrew Wessels, whose Altadena home has smoke damage, high levels of lead and more. “But I’ll believe stuff when I see it on any of these things.”
Wessels, his wife and two children have lived in seven different places since the Eaton Fire. He told CalMatters today that he is waiting on at least $25,000 in reimbursements from State Farm, and has not yet bothered to submit “a bunch” more requests for reimbursement because it seems futile at this moment. Last week, the insurer assigned him a new adjuster — the fourth so far.
State Farm said it is cooperating with the investigation.
“A fair review will find that thousands of State Farm customers are being helped by our teams on the ground in Los Angeles County and are very satisfied,” said Sevag Sarkissian, spokesperson for State Farm. He said the company has paid more than $3.96 billion on more than 12,000 claims by its California customers as of this week.
As part of the investigation, the insurance department is asking State Farm customers to continue to submit complaints. The department has so far received hundreds of claims related to the LA-area fires, a significant number of which are about State Farm, department spokesperson Gabriel Sanchez said today. 
Formal investigations by the insurance department are known as market-conduct examinations. They have resulted in correcting insurance companies’ practices, said department spokesperson Michael Soller. After wildfires in 2015 and 2017, the department’s investigations of a handful of insurers including State Farm resulted in about $158 million more in claims recovered, Soller said. State Farm received approval to raise the premiums of its California customers last month, and is seeking additional rate increases.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010725_Palisades-Fire_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

SPRINGFIELD – In a year when many state agencies received little or no funding increase, state lawmakers this year approved an increase of $15.7 million, or 22.4%, for general operating expenses in Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office.

That General Revenue Fund increase is significantly more than some other constitutional officers received for their operating expenses in the upcoming fiscal year. It’s also more than the $15 million that Raoul himself requested when he appeared before House and Senate appropriations committees this year – although reductions in revenue from other state funds left Raoul’s all-funds budget roughly flat from a year ago.

Raoul’s office did not respond to repeated requests to comment for this story about why lawmakers approved a larger general operating budget than he had requested, and why the budget reflected such significant cuts in two specific non-GRF funds.

During budget hearings in April, Raoul said he needed additional funding to hire attorneys and other staff to handle the increased workload that his office now manages. Some of that workload, he said, is the result of legislation that has given the attorney general’s office more responsibility.

But he also mentioned the increased workload that stems from more than a dozen lawsuits his office has joined challenging actions of the Trump administration as well as defending the state against legal actions the administration has filed against Illinois.

“This budget will support supplying the requisite attorneys to step up where the federal government is stepping away, as well as attorneys involved in critical cases to protect our state’s interests,” Raoul told a House budget committee.

At the time of those hearings, Raoul’s office declined requests by Capitol News Illinois to provide specific information about how many new attorneys or other staff it intended to hire with the additional money.

“We can’t give a specific number of staff we will be hiring but the requested $15 million increase in GRF funding will allow us to have a stable source of funding to adequately respond to both costs associated with supporting the attorneys defending ongoing federal challenges as well as new and longstanding state laws,” Raoul’s spokesperson Drew Hill said in an April 17 email.

According to the budget bill lawmakers passed on the final day of the legislative session, Raoul’s office will receive $85.7 million in General Revenue Fund money “to meet its operational expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026.” That’s up from $70 million that was provided in the same line item in the fiscal year 2025 budget bill.

By comparison, lawmakers approved an increase of just under $1 million, or 3%, in the comptroller’s general operating budget. And they approved an increase of about $2.4 million, or 5.7%, in non-GRF funds for the operating budget of the state treasurer’s office.

The attorney general’s budget includes several line items that are also funded with GRF money. Those include specific funding for the office’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit and the Child Support Enforcement Division. They also include funding for various grants for organized retail crime enforcement and grants under the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Act.

All told, lawmakers approved a total GRF budget for the attorney general’s office next year of $116.05 million, an increase of $10.75 million, or 10.2%, over this year’s budget.

The office also receives appropriations of revenue from sources other than the General Revenue Fund, such as the Illinois Gaming Law Enforcement Fund, the Cannabis Expungement Fund and the Illinois Tobacco Fund that are earmarked for specific purposes.

It also receives appropriations from two funds that receive money from court-ordered and voluntary settlements of consumer protection lawsuits and from civil penalties that are paid to the attorney general’s office. By statute, both funds may be used, subject to appropriations, for the “exercise of the duties of the Attorney General.”

The budget lawmakers just approved for the upcoming fiscal year reflects a combined $16.9 million reduction in appropriations from those two funds.

As a result, the total “all funds budget” for the attorney general’s office next year comes to about $194.465 million, which is just $700,000 more than this year’s budget.

Jordan, at 79 the state’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, was first convicted in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter in Harrison County. He had four trials until a death sentence stuck in 1998. 
On Thursday, eight of the nine justices of the Mississippi Supreme Court declined to rehear an order to set Jordan’s execution date. Justice Leslie King was the lone person who wanted to grant a rehearing. 
This decision comes about a week after Jordan’s attorney, Krissy Nobile of the Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, wrote to the court to emphasize that her client has not yet exhausted federal remedies and an execution could not be set. 
The U.S. Supreme Court distributed Jordan’s petition for a writ of certiorari at a May 29 conference and is expected to discuss it again at a June 18 conference – a week before the execution. 
Meanwhile, Jordan’s attorneys filed an emergency application for a stay of execution with Justice Samuel Alito Jr. pending the court’s disposition on the case. 
They argue there is a reasonable prospect that the court will grant certiorari and reverse the Mississippi Supreme Court’s decision, and that Jordan will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not ordered. 
In its response, the state argues Jordan has been trying to avoid his death sentence for almost 50 years and that he is repeating baseless arguments in his pending petition for certiorari. 
His attorneys argue Jordan’s death sentence is not valid because in 1976, when the murder was committed and Jordan was sentenced, Mississippi and all other states had ceased executions based on a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia that capital punishment was unconstitutional.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/06115731/e004b-carroll_gartin_justice_building_-_mississippi_supreme_court.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

What’s not average is the uncertainty over whether government-backed efforts to reduce its size will falter as the Trump administration scales back federal agencies involved in the process.,"An aerial view of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on June 7, 2024. Nutrients from throughout the Mississippi River basin wash down into the Gulf of Mexico, creating an annual “dead zone” of low oxygen conditions. Aerial support provided by SouthWings. Credit: La’Shance Perry, The Lens Annual forecasts for the Gulf “dead zone” at the mouth of the Mississippi River predicts the section of water with low oxygen levels will be about average in size this year. 
What’s less certain is whether government efforts to reduce its size will falter as the Trump administration scales back agencies involved in the process.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts the dead zone will be around 5,500 square miles this summer. Some estimates suggest it will be a little smaller, including those from LSU research scientists Nancy Rabalais and R. Eugene Turner. Their study predicts the hypoxic zone to be around 4,800 square miles, taking into account how warmer water temperatures have altered the Gulf’s complex food web, helping reduce the dead zone.
The different models share one key element: their predicted size is about three times  bigger than experts would like to see it.

A basin-wide problem
When nitrogen and phosphorus from farming fertilizers upriver washes down to the Gulf, the excess nutrients can cause algae to bloom near the surface of the water. When the algae dies and decomposes, it sinks into the water and depletes the oxygen fish and other aquatic life need to survive.
The hypoxic conditions affect commercial and recreational fishing as well as cause ecological harm. 
Efforts to reduce nutrient runoff into the Gulf are largely outlined in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Hypoxia Task Force Action Plan. Long-term, its goal is to reduce the dead zone to about 1,900 square miles by 2035. Its short-term objective is to drop the amount nitrogen and phosphorus emptying into the Gulf by 20%. 
Data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an integral agency in predicting the annual size of the dead zone, found the river’s phosphorus load was up 31% but its nitrate levels were about 24% below average in May. 
That’s just a snapshot from a single month, said Doug Daigle, an LSU coastal research scientist and coordinator for the Louisiana Hypoxia Working Group, a state-based organization working to address the Gulf’s dead zone. He emphasized that multi-year data will give the most accurate picture into whether the U.S. is on target to meet its goals. 
“Obviously, you don’t like it to be bigger in the years when it’s bigger, but then we also need to keep it in perspective in years when it’s smaller. It’s the trend over time that we’re looking at,” he said. “And we’re not at square one.”
Uncertainty ahead
Whether key federal agencies such as the USGS and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will have sufficient funding and manpower to gauge if reduction goals are even being met is uncertain, Daigle said. 
“There’s a lot of question marks about what’s happening to the federal agencies and their capacity … between the mass firings and all the other things that are happening,” he said. 
Large sections of NOAA staff have been reduced, and USGS research and data collection funding faces millions of dollars in cutbacks. 
Daigle added there’s supposed to be a meeting of the EPA’s Hypoxia Task Force later this year, but with all of the federal changes, its members might not have the bandwidth to assess whether reduction goals are being met. 
“That’s all tentative at this point,” he said. 
An EPA spokesperson said in an email that the agency “takes this initiative very seriously” and will continue its progress. They did not respond to specific questions over staffing capacity and funding resources. 
NOAA’s communications staff declined to comment on staffing capacity, saying it “remains dedicated to providing timely information, research and resources.” 
Several federal task force positions remain vacant as of June 12, with only “TBD” listed on the EPA’s website for spots reserved for its own representatives, the Geological Survey,  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and other federal agencies. 
NOAA predicts the size of the dead zone at the beginning of the summer using an aggregate of models from various partner universities, including LSU and the University of Michigan. The agency will monitor and survey the dead zone throughout the summer and review its estimates against the size of the actual dead zone in August.
“It’s about human behavior. There’s both a watershed issue and a global climate change issue here,” Turner said. 
Turner and Rabalais agreed the problem isn’t with the EPA’s plan but a need for greater efforts to reduce nitrogen runoff upstream. Solutions such as cover crops and crop rotation strategies help farmers keep fertilizer in their soil for better plant growth and reduce hypoxia-causing runoff.
“Every place is going to be a little different, but there are ways to reduce this,” Turner said.  
Whether funding will continue to support these programs is unknown. Aside from some Inflation Reduction Act money and funds from previous federal farm bills, financial support for nutrient reduction has been “modest,” Daigle said. 
“There’s a lot of questions about what’s going to happen,” he added.
This upstream uncertainty affects industries that depend on the Gulf, such as commercial seafood harvesting, according to Daigle. 
“They’re under a lot of stress” from hurricanes and the influx of cheap, foreign shrimp saturating the market, he said. Reducing the hypoxic zone before it becomes the final nail in the coffin for shrimping in the Gulf is part of the Task Force’s plan, and now is the time to drive home these reduction strategies, Daigle said 
“The idea was that you wouldn’t wait for that to happen. You start reducing the loading, you reverse the trend,” he said.

Alex Padilla,Jeanne Kuang and Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/06/alex-padilla-handcuffed/,Alex Padilla is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. FBI agents handcuffed him after he interrupted a press conference on immigration enforcement in LA.,"In summary
Alex Padilla is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. FBI agents handcuffed him after he interrupted a press conference on immigration enforcement in LA.


Federal agents forcibly removed U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla from a Homeland Security press conference in Los Angeles on Thursday, pushing him to the ground and handcuffing him in a skirmish widely condemned by California Democrats. 
Padilla had walked into a press conference in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was defending her agency’s crackdown on illegal immigration in LA, where workplace raids starting last Friday spurred widespread protests, confrontations between activists and agents and President Donald Trump’s extraordinary deployment of the National Guard. 
In videos of the incident shared on social media, Padilla identifies himself in front of an array of news cameras and says he has “questions for the secretary” as two men, apparently with the Secret Service, push him away from Noem’s lectern and toward the door. 
He seemed to be challenging Noem’s assertion that immigration agents had focused on arresting “violent criminals” when guards pushed him into the hallway. Three armed men, two of them in FBI uniforms, forced Padilla onto the ground and handcuffed him behind his back. Another tells the person recording the video, who identifies himself as a Padilla staffer, to stop recording.
California Democrats immediately slammed the response.
“Senator Alex Padilla is one of the most decent people I know,” Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media. “This is outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now.”
The Trump administration in recent weeks has ramped up not only immigration raids but also its hardline response to critics. 
In LA, federal prosecutors charged well-known union leader David Huerta with conspiracy to impede a federal officer for his role in a protest outside a downtown garment warehouse last Friday where immigration agents were serving a search warrant and arresting immigrant workers. In New Jersey, they have charged Democratic U.S. Rep. Monica McIver with assault over a physical altercation that occurred when members of Congress visited an immigration detention center in Newark.
Gov. Newsom appointed Padilla to the Senate in 2020, filling the seat left by former Vice President Kamala Harris. He came up in politics through the Los Angeles City Council, and is the first Latino to represent California in the Senate. 
After agents released Padilla, he met briefly with Noem. Speaking with reporters afterward, Padilla said he had a briefing scheduled in the federal building and went to the press conference because lawmakers have gotten “little to no information” when making inquiries about the department’s “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions.”
“If this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, I can only imagine what they’re doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the Los Angeles community,” he said.
Homeland Security officials wrote on the department’s X account that Padilla’s interruption was “disrespectful political theatre” and that Secret Service agents thought he was an attacker. 
On Fox News, Noem said Padilla had not identified himself until he was “lunging forward.”
“Perhaps he wanted the scene,” she said.
Republicans, too, lept to defend their own. 
“If I busted into a press conference with the Governor or Sen. Padilla, I promise you, the same exact thing would happen to me,” Assemblymember Joe Patterson, a Rocklin Republican, wrote on social media.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061225_Alex-Padilla_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Gov. Ned Lamont has signed into law an overhaul of Connecticut’s century-old towing statutes that came after an investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica exposed lax standards and predatory practices that victimized people who live paycheck to paycheck.
The bill was one of 28 that Lamont signed before departing for a vacation to Europe, followed by attendance Sunday through Tuesday at the Paris Air Show as part of a delegation of Connecticut aerospace manufacturers. Lamont now has signed 64 of the bills passed in the session that ended June 4.
Public Act 25-55 offers new protections against tows without warning from private property. In some cases, vehicle owners who could not afford to pay the fees to recover their vehicles lost them permanently. CT Mirror reporters found cases where companies required them to pay in cash or wouldn’t allow them to retrieve personal belongings.
[Gone in 15 days: How the Connecticut DMV allows tow companies to sell people’s cars]
State law allows tow companies to begin the process of selling a towed vehicle with a value of $1,500 of less after 15 days, too quick to challenge the legitimacy of a tow. 
It is the shortest window in all but two states, Iowa and North Carolina, and a far different standard than neighboring states. Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York require at least 60 days before a towed car can be sold for non-payment of towing and storage charges.
The new law still allows the sales process to begin after 15 days for a car worth $1,500 or less, but it extends the minimum time that garage owners must hold a vehicle before selling it to 30 or 60 days, depending on a vehicle’s value. 
It also requires, among other things, tow companies to accept credit and debit cards  for payment and provide access to the contents of a towed vehicle or allow an owner to recover it within four hours.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_0806_SR_MyHoopty_012_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Sterlingrb and UpAhead Design, via Wikimedia  Commons The Louisiana Legislature has created a new award level for the state’s popular tuition assistance program that will cover the entirety of tuition and fees at public universities for the highest-performing students. 
House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, creates the TOPS Excellence award, which is available to any student with a 3.5 grade point average and a score of 31 or higher on the ACT or an equivalent score on a similar exam. The scholarship will provide tuition and fees at the Louisiana public university the student chooses or $12,000, whichever is less. 
“It’s a big win,” Turner said. 
Originally, Turner’s bill would have created a flat rate for each level of TOPS award rather than a unique allotment for each school. The new rate would have meant students at LSU, its two medical schools and the University of New Orleans would have paid more out of pocket, while students at other Louisiana schools would have paid less. 
The provisions drew the criticism of Phyllis Taylor, whose late husband Patrick F. Taylor was responsible for the creation of the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, a merit-based scholarship program for Louisiana students who attend in-state public colleges and universities. 
The original proposal was scaled back because it substantially increased the cost of the program. 
Instituting just the new TOPS Excellence award level will increase state spending $3 million in the first year, assuming 844 qualified students. The cost will increase over the next four years to a total cost of $12 million, when approximately 3,300 students are predicted to receive the award annually. 
Turner’s bill also allows students to qualify for any TOPS award level by taking the conservative-backed Classical Learning Test, which evaluates students on math, writing and grammar with an emphasis on classic literature and historic documents. Its supporters frequently tout that the exam emphasizes texts that “shaped Western culture.” 
The Classical Learning Test has been embraced by conservative lawmakers in Oklahoma, Florida and Arkansas. and has the support of the conservative Cato Institute and Heritage Foundation. 
Oklahoma lawmakers extensively debated embracing the Classical Learning Test to qualify for their version of TOPS, with Democrats arguing it doesn’t meet the same academic rigor and anti-cheating measures as the ACT. 
In Louisiana, only Louisiana Christian University accepts the Classical Learning Test for admissions, according to the CLT exam website.
Turner’s bill will go into effect unless Gov. Jeff Landry vetoes it.

Charley Thomson chats with attendees at a rally against CO2 pipelines at the Iowa Capitol March 18, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The issue of eminent domain as it pertains to a carbon sequestration pipeline project in Iowa has put Republicans at odds with one another, but Gov. Kim Reynolds’ Wednesday decision to veto a bill on the issue has amplified the tensions. 
On a call with landowners opposed to the pipeline project and upset by the veto, Rep. Steven Holt, a Republican from Denison and one of the lawmakers leading eminent domain and pipeline-related legislation, said there will be “consequences for the governor’s agenda” moving forward. 
“The governor’s lack of leadership is why we are where we are today, and it will affect her agenda going forward until the end of her term,” Holt said.

Landowners on the call were similarly upset by Reynolds’ decision, following years of silence on the issue. Peg Rasmussen, who owns land in Montgomery County, said “a true leader steps in when a problem arises” but “Reynolds did nothing.” 
“The legacy you leave behind is one of bowing down to big business at the expense of Iowans,” Rasmussen said. 


Background: 
Tensions around eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines have risen in response to proposed projects in Iowa.
Three projects, Navigator CO2, Wolf Carbon Solutions and Summit Carbon Solutions have sought to build carbon sequestration pipelines through Iowa.
The first two projects were withdrawn, but the Summit project received a permit from the Iowa Utilities Commission in June 2024 and has more than 1,300 voluntary easements signed for the project.
Landowners opposed to the pipelines have lobbied for four years against the projects, and in particular their ability to use eminent domain. This year lawmakers narrowly passed House File 639 to change the definition of a common carrier for hazardous liquid pipelines, increase insurance requirements, set permit limits and add requirements to the IUC.
Opponents of the bill said it changed the rules in the middle of the game, had unintended consequences to critical energy infrastructure and would stop Iowa from leading the nation in biofuels production.


Landowners also directed their animosity toward Republican lawmakers who opposed the bill, namely at senators who failed to take up the issue for four years, then argued House File 639 was a bad bill. 
“The fight for private property rights will continue,” Rasmussen, who was part of a group of landowners regularly lobbying at the State Capitol, said. “Iowa legislators and Gov. Reynolds, we’ll see you at the Capitol in 2026, and we can’t wait to tell our legislators how we feel about their votes in the 2026 election.” 
Holt said the “leadership void” from the governor and “civil war” among Senate Republicans has exposed the difference between “country club Republicans” and “grassroots Republicans.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, a Republican from Charles City who wrote the now-vetoed HF 639, and who, with Holt, has led much of the legislation on the issue, said the opposing Republicans are part of the “anything-for-a-buck ‘wing’ of the party” and don’t represent the “vast majority” of Iowa Republicans.
“In the governor’s view, constitutional rights, such as eminent domain protections, should not be allowed to interfere with schemes to make money, especially if those schemes are being promoted by her friends, supporters, and contributors,” Thomson wrote in a statement. 
Bruce Rastetter, founder of Summit Agricultural Group, which started Summit Carbon Solutions, has been a top campaign contributor to Reynolds’ campaigns, sparking some of the criticism leveled at the governor.
In her explanation of the veto decision, Reynolds wrote the bill had “vague legal standards” and would impact projects beyond just the use of eminent domain. Reynolds cited the permit limits clause in the bill and increased requirements for insurance as setting a precedent that “threatens” the state’s business reputation.
Senate President Amy Sinclair expressed the same beliefs on the bill. In a recent appearance on Iowa Press, Sinclair said HF 639 “was not a property owners rights bill” but rather a bill “that’s just going to facilitate activists.”
“To say I was a person who opposed property rights, that’s 100% false,” Sinclair said on the show.
Sinclair and other Republicans who were opposed to HF 639 voted for a re-write amendment to the bill, sponsored by Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, that would have allowed companies to avoid eminent domain and instead pursue voluntary easements outside of the project corridor. It also would have held operators responsible for damage to the land for the project’s lifetime.
Thomson said Reynolds’ stated concerns were a “polite window-dressing” for the governor’s “real message” that she will “veto any bill that Summit Carbon Solutions dislikes.”
In reaction to the veto, Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, vowed during a Radio Iowa interview to “work to kill every single piece of legislation that has (Reynolds’) name on it.”
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the attacks from lawmakers. 
Summit Carbon Solutions, in a statement following the veto, said it looks forward to “continued discussions with state leaders” as the project advances.
Thomson and Holt said they are supportive of House Speaker Pat Grassley’s call to petition for a special session in order to override the veto of the bill.
The motion for a special session, and to override the veto, would require support from both chambers, which Senate majority leadership indicated Wednesday would be unlikely.
Corey Cerwinske, a Bremer County supervisor attending the virtual press conference, said lawmakers should introduce articles of impeachment on the governor for her “malfeasance.” 
Holt said while the veto “may violate” the constitutional rights of Iowans, the governor’s action “probably doesn’t rise to the level of impeachment.”

In her veto explanation, Reynolds asked the Iowa Utilities Commission to implement a section of the bill that required attendance at informational meetings and during live testimony. 
This was a problem brought up by landowners and lawmakers during the proceedings for the Summit Carbon Solutions permit. They alleged IUC would send representatives to meetings rather than commissioners, and that all three commissioners were not present during live testimony.
The IUC in a Thursday press release said it “fully supports” the “transparency goals” the governor requested and “will begin implementing” the practices. The release said the commission will also reinstate its public, monthly commission meetings beginning in August. 
“The IUC remains dedicated to fair, transparent, and accountable governance of Iowa’s energy and utility infrastructure,” the statement read.

Geri Peterson can tell you about the citizen discontent behind Saturday’s “No Kings” rally in Burlington, the largest of several dozen Vermont demonstrations — and 1,800 national events — set to protest the Trump administration.
As a lead organizer, she also knows about the unseen costs.
Peterson has learned the price of a permit to take over Burlington’s Waterfront Park from noon to 4 p.m. is $4,000. Renting a stage is another $4,000. Hiring a standby ambulance service is yet another $4,000. Add private security, traffic patrols, support personnel and portable restrooms and the final tab is expected to total about $20,000.
“It’s an enormous undertaking,” she said.
Peterson arranged a similar “Hands Off!” protest April 5 on the Statehouse lawn in Montpelier. Joining peers at 1,000 sister events nationwide, volunteers at the Vermont capital raised about $6,000 for a local street closure permit and security to handle an expected 6,000 people, only to see the crowd swell to an estimated 10,000.
Peterson hopes Saturday’s rally in Burlington will draw up to 20,000 people for speakers including U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., cartoonist Alison Bechdel and Columbia University protester Mohsen Mahdawi.

“Fingers crossed,” Peterson said of a potential appearance by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.
The event is one of several dozen around the state and more than 1,800 across the nation set to counter a Washington, D.C., military parade on President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Vermont activists are building off a March 1 protest during Vice President JD Vance’s visit to the Sugarbush resort and several dozen April 5 “Hands Off!” resistance rallies statewide.
Organizers with the national 50501 and Indivisible networks said they hope their “No Kings” efforts will attract a total U.S. crowd larger than the estimated 3 to 5 million “Hands Off!” participants in April.
Vermont State Police and the Department of Public Safety don’t anticipate the protests will require them to increase their staffing or spending, according to spokesperson Adam Silverman. But Saturday’s demonstrations, set for communities as far north as Barton and as far south as Bennington, could squeeze the finances of at least one town.
Brattleboro organizers are planning for 1,000 people or more to gather on the town common from 3 to 6 p.m. The local government is charging $50 for the park rental and $25 for an event permit, although it won’t bill for police and public safety expenses anticipated to total up to $900 per hour.
“Our policy has been for the town to absorb the costs of these larger rallies,” Town Manager John Potter told the local selectboard at a meeting last week.
But hearing complaints about a 10.8% tax hike in the town budget, Brattleboro officials plan to ask protest organizers to voluntarily pay more until the municipality considers a higher fee structure.
“In recognition of what’s happening in the nation, there will be more events,” selectboard chair Elizabeth McLoughlin said.

By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers to help patients stay up-to-date on immunizations — a win for individuals and for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Tracking immunizations so y[...]","Immunizations have long been one of Vermont’s most powerful public health tools, helping protect both individuals and communities from serious illness. But keeping track of your vaccine status can feel surprisingly complicated.
Who hasn’t had that moment in urgent care, staring blankly when asked, “When was your last tetanus shot?” And if you’re managing not just your own vaccines, but also those of your kids or aging parents, the challenges only multiply.
Health care providers have long relied on a powerful tool for accessing the most complete immunization histories possible for their patients: the Vermont Department of Health’s Vermont Immunization Registry, a secure, centralized system containing Vermonters’ immunization records. Now, that data is even more efficiently accessible to busy primary care providers and practice staff through a partnership between VITL (Vermont’s nonprofit health data sharing network), the Vermont Department of Health, and practices and hospitals around the state.    
VITL offers a new service to primary care practices and other health care provider offices, directly connecting their electronic health records to the Vermont Immunization Registry, so they can query for data in an instant, without opening another program. 
In the past year, VITL delivered immunization data into providers’ electronic health records over half a million times. For patients, it happens behind the scenes, delivering their essential records to their health care providers when and where they need them.
Here are three things to know about how VITL is helping you stay on top of essential immunizations.
1) What is health information sharing?
At the heart of this effort is health information sharing — but what does that actually mean?
In short, it’s the secure electronic sharing of your medical information, like vaccine history, among your providers. VITL connects many Vermont practices and hospitals to each other and centralizes data to create one health record for each Vermonter. That record includes information like your name and date of birth, along with allergies, medications, lab results, and immunizations. 
Having one record from the many places you receive care enables your providers to access a more complete, up-to-date picture of your medical history and current treatments. The data is available to health care providers and staff, insurance providers for certain initiatives such as care coordination, and public health professionals like the staff at the Vermont Department of Health who lead initiatives to keep Vermonters healthy and well. 
2) Faster access to immunization records means better care
A real-world example of this system in action comes from Primary Care Health Partners (PCHP), one of Vermont’s largest independent medical groups.
In the past, PCHP staff often had to manually check state records or call pharmacies to get vaccine histories — a time-consuming process for already busy primary care staff. But now (thanks to the Immunization Registry Query & Response Service, as it is known to the medical community), things have gotten easier.
Now, with just a few clicks, PCHP providers and staff can instantly pull immunization records from the Vermont Immunization Registry right in their own electronic health record, freeing up valuable time for patient care. PCHP estimates their nurses save more than an hour and 20 minutes every day, thanks to the VITL service. This system also ensures that clinicians have the most current immunization data, which is critical for supporting each individual’s health and for protecting vulnerable populations and improving public health outcomes.
3) Updated immunization records help patients stay on schedule
One of the biggest advantages of this system is its ability to help keep immunization schedules on track.
The VITL service enables primary care clinicians and staff to pull immunization records from other providers’ offices — and from clinics and pharmacies — right into their patient’s record for a more comprehensive immunization history. Even better, the system can flag upcoming or overdue immunizations, helping patients and families stay ahead of their health needs even if they can’t track everything themselves.
“Immunizations are crucial for preventing the spread of infectious diseases,” says Amanda Jones, Informatics Director at the Vermont Department of Health. “The Vermont Immunization Registry gives health care providers easy access to individual vaccination records and forecasts future patient immunization needs — this technology is keeping people in Vermont up-to-date on vaccines and really protecting our communities.”
By connecting the dots across the health care system, VITL is making it easier for providers and patients alike to manage immunizations — a win not just for individuals, but also for public health across the state. It’s one more reason Vermont continues to rank among the healthiest states in the country.
If you want to learn more about how VITL shares your health data with health care providers, there is information on vitl.net/sharing. Every Vermonter has options, and you can explore them on the VITL website. The VITL team is also available to talk with you and answer questions about health information sharing Monday–Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., excluding holidays. VITL’s toll-free number is 1-888-980-1243.

MONTPELIER — Amid President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations, the City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to form a committee that will develop a strategy for navigating U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity within Montpelier and improve how the city communicates residents’ rights.
The proposal was introduced by Councilor Pelin Kohn, who was born in Turkey and moved to the United States with her American husband in 2017. She became a citizen in 2020 and is a board member for the Central Vermont Refugee Action Network.“Sometimes, ICE-related things are like news for people. … But for people I know, support and work with, it is their reality, and they live in fear,” she said. “For me, as an immigrant American, it is a very, very real fear. I’ve been approached by different community members, different groups, and I thought maybe our city can just review all the policies we have.”Kohn’s proposal seeks to strengthen Montpelier’s already progressive immigration policy by having the ad hoc committee develop a community strategy for responding to “any ICE activity within city limits,” and improve “public communication, including the development of a dedicated, accessible city web page outlining resident rights, city policy, and emergency resources.”
Montpelier became Vermont’s third sanctuary city — a municipality that limits its cooperation with federal authorities to protect undocumented immigrants — in 2016. Since then, the city has adopted strategies like the “fair and impartial policing” policy, which sets strict guidelines for how Montpelier police can enforce immigration law, and restricts police cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Sanctuary cities have come under fire by Trump, who tried to pull federal and FEMA funding from sanctuary cities and recently listed them online. The administration later pulled this list down after it mislabeled multiple locations.Councilor Ben Doyle expressed concerns about potential backlash from the federal government to any further pro-immigrant moves by the city.
“I think the motive here is really good, it’s to keep our neighbors safe,” Doyle said. “[But] when I read the description of the purpose of the committee, I did get nervous about potential unintended consequences.” 
The creation of the committee follows a statewide push for institutions addressing immigration. Gov. Phil Scott recently signed a bill establishing a committee to study whether the state should create an Office of New Americans to support people who entered Vermont from outside the country, and another putting restrictions on state agencies and local governments from entering into agreements with federal immigration officials.

Alex Padilla at a Thursday press conference in Los Angeles by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem amid multi-day protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.The scuffle between law enforcement, including an officer wearing a jacket with an FBI logo, and a United States senator represented a stark escalation of tensions after President Donald Trump ordered 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA. His action followed major protests sparked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials ramping up immigration raids.Before Padilla was physically removed, Noem said that the Trump administration would continue its immigration enforcement in LA.“We are not going away,” Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, said. “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into the city.”Padilla, 52, a member of the Senate since 2021, when he was appointed to replace former Vice President Kamala Harris, and then elected in 2022, tried to ask Noem a question and was rushed by federal law enforcement.“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla and I have questions for the secretary,” he said as four federal law enforcement officers grabbed him and shoved him to the ground. “Hands off.”The DHS wrote on social media that U.S. Secret Service officers thought “he was an attacker and officers acted appropriately.”DHS said that after the press conference, Noem and Padilla had a 15-minute meeting. His office did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.In a statement, Padilla’s office said the California senator was in LA for congressional oversight into the federal government’s operations in LA and across California.“He was in the federal building to receive a briefing with General Guillot and was listening to Secretary Noem’s press conference,” his office said, referring to General Gregory M. Guillot, commander of United States Northern Command.“He tried to ask the Secretary a question, and was forcibly removed by federal agents, forced to the ground and handcuffed. He is not currently detained, and we are working to get additional information.”The incident drew swift condemnation from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York.“Watching this video sickened my stomach, the manhandling of a United States Senator, Senator Padilla,” Schumer wrote on social media. “We need immediate answers to what the hell went on.”On the Senate floor, Schumer said the video of Padilla “reeks of totalitarianism.”He called for a full investigation so that “this doesn’t happen again.”Padilla gave remarks after the incident, with The Associated Press. He did not take questions. “If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question, if this is how the Department of Homeland Security responds to a senator with a question, you can only imagine what they're doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers out in the Los Angeles community,” Padilla said.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Mike Lee, R-Utah, participates in a forum hosted by the Sutherland Institute at the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics on Oct. 14, 2024. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)This story first appeared on Utah News Dispatch.
U.S. Sen. Mike Lee is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah and other Western states.
Lee, a Utah Republican, says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth. Opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nev., that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
According to the amendment, both agencies would be required to dispose of between 0.5% and 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.
Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s — identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, such as national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right — like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way — is also off-limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of interior and agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C., out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
But that reasoning didn’t fly with a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C., director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West.” The National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal. The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George in Utah. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (such as reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.
“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.”
Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

John James’s burgeoning gubernatorial campaign met an unexpected – albeit lighthearted – roadblock on Thursday: President Donald Trump.
In a news conference, Trump spoke to the press and a crowd of U.S. lawmakers before signing a bill that James (R-Shelby Township) sponsored to “stop California’s radical electric vehicle mandate and protect American auto jobs,” as James described on X.

During a string of thank yous to lawmakers who put forward the bill, Trump ribbed James over his campaign to seek the Michigan Republican Party nomination for governor in 2026. Trump joked that the party wouldn’t let him run for governor if he didn’t have a suitable replacement in Congress.
In response, James spokesperson Hannah Osantowske told Michigan Advance that James was “flattered by the president’s acknowledgment … that his departure from the House will be a loss for Congress.”
“While Washington may see John’s departure as a loss, it will certainly be Michigan’s gain,” Osantowske said.

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A list of 14 states, 298 counties and 200 cities deemed immigration sanctuaries by the Trump administration has disappeared from a government website but continues to hang over the heads of officials who face threats of losing federal funding.
“We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause,” said Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, North Carolina, a heavily Democratic county that nevertheless complies with a new state law requiring cooperation with immigration arrests.
“The list is gone. Am I satisfied that it was rectified? Yes. Am I satisfied that it’s over? No,” Blackwood said.
The list went up May 29. It called out the “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The White House had already threatened “suspension or termination” of federal funds to them.
Along with counties and cities, the list named the whole states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia as “state sanctuary” areas.
There was immediate reaction from some areas, not only Democratic states and counties with court-tested legal policies of declining cooperation with deportation, but also conservative areas mystified by their inclusion.
“We figure it must be some kind of mix-up. We certainly support our fellow law enforcement agencies,” said James Davel, administrative coordinator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, which was included despite no apparent immigration sanctuary policy. The county voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 by more than 67%.
One possible explanation: The county board passed a resolution in 2021 declaring Shawano a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” as a sign of “vigorous support of the peoples’ Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.”
The list disappeared from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website in a matter of days, after the National Sheriffs’ Association complained that many counties were erroneously included.
“It was quite the debacle,” said sheriffs’ association spokesperson Patrick Royal. “We are working with the administration to resolve as much as we can.”
But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a television appearance that the list would come back and was largely accurate.
“That list is absolutely continuing to be used and it is going to be identifying those cities and those jurisdictions that aren’t honoring law and justice,” Noem said in a Fox News interview June 1.
Courts have so far upheld local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration arrests. California won a lawsuit on the issue in 2017 under the first Trump administration, and the same federal judge issued an injunction saying federal funds couldn’t be withheld on the basis of immigration cooperation during a new trial on the issue.
The national sheriffs’ association president, Sheriff Kieran Donahue of Canyon County, Idaho, said in a May 31 statement that the list “was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation.” He said it was “an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.” Canyon County was not on the list, though the city of Boise was.
The pushback from sheriffs was a sign of how seriously flawed the list was, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
“The real problem is, how are they defining sanctuary?” Putzel-Kavanaugh said. “To have pushback from an association that is typically quite supportive of this administration and their agenda points to problems with definition.”
Watauga County, North Carolina, was on the list when it first appeared May 29 but came off before it was taken down. The county’s congressional representative, Republican Virginia Foxx, said in a Facebook post that she intervened.
In the post, Foxx called it “a mistake … made during the Biden administration that resulted in Watauga County being listed incorrectly as a sanctuary county.” She also said that “Watauga County is no longer listed” after she “contacted DHS.”
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group favoring less immigration, said her list of sanctuary jurisdictions included Watauga based on a June 2024 report from U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement listing it as among hundreds of others as “non-cooperative institutions.”
Vaughan said data she requested from ICE shows some counties in North Carolina were still not complying with all detainers this year through early February, but Watauga is not one of them
“They should probably come off the list,” she said. “None of those sheriffs has contacted me about reviewing their policies or taking them off the map. I would be happy to do so, and have done so frequently with sheriffs in other states.”
Sheriff Len Hagaman of Watauga County told Stateline via email that he had contacted federal immigration officials and confirmed that his county, which voted Democratic for president last year by a 52% to 46% margin, had a solid record of cooperating with immigration arrests.
Hagaman alluded to an April Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, calling out Watauga and eight other North Carolina counties as immigration sanctuaries.
“For several weeks now, I, along with other North Carolina sheriffs have had to endure gross and inaccurate misinformation regarding false allegations,” Hagaman wrote.

(Courtesy of the City of Las Cruces / Kelsey Hiss)Las Cruces is moving forward with a project to cool the city’s hottest homes, but on a much smaller scale, city officials said, after the federal government pulled funds with little official communication.
“I don’t want to say canceled because formally no one has told us that,” said City of Las Cruces Sustainability Officer Jenney Hernandez. “But no one has also told us or talked to us since announcing that they have been — so to speak — on pause.”
Since 2022, the city was committed for $1.5 million in state and U.S. Department of Energy grants to install the heat pumps with a plan to outfit between 130 to 150 homes in two years.
Between funding received from the New Mexico Legislature and some leftover federal funds and vouchers, the program has about $700,000, Hernandez said, nearly half of what the city had secured initially.
“Now that all of this happened, it just means we have to reduce the initial amounts of home we anticipated to serve,” Hernandez said. “Quite honestly, we’re limping a lot at this point.”
The cooling program is only becoming more urgent as increasing heat threatens Las Cruces residents’ health.
“It’s a life threat for people experiencing high temperatures in their homes, with no other options for cooling,” she said.
In 2020, Las Cruces mapped the urban heat island effect by measuring the heat-trapping power of concrete and asphalt and the cooling impact of shaded green spaces. Las Cruces found the effect made low-income neighborhoods as much as 14 degrees hotter than higher-income neighborhoods, making it feel like 112 degrees when the air temperature measured 107 degrees.
These neighborhoods include some of the city’s oldest homes with many low-income families or seniors.
“You have a very sensitive population residing in these homes that have to deal with almost three months straight of triple-degree weather,” Hernandez said. “If you’re lucky, a swamp cooler in triple-degree weather and humidity will cool your house to about 90 degrees, which, after several consecutive days, is really detrimental to your health.”
Based on those findings, the city developed a plan to bring cooling into low-income neighborhoods by installing all-electric heat pumps. Despite the name, the heat pump also offers efficient cooling of outside or underground air. Heat pumps work in more conditions than swamp coolers and may be cheaper than air conditioning over time, Hernandez said, noting incentives for such pumps through both the federal Inflation Reduction Act and state programs.
In January, when about to sign one grant contract for $400,000, the city received an email from the grant contractors that said “The DOE team has asked us to reschedule all sessions for the rest of the month,” and which canceled all meetings booked into April.
A second DOE grant, which Las Cruces first won in 2022, and was anticipating securing another $400,000 from in March, was “postponed,” according to an email from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
Hernandez said federal agencies have told the city the funding is under review, but has no answers for a timeline or if funding opportunities will be restored.
“Our office of Sustainability has — I don’t want to say lost — but is being ghosted on the money that has been awarded,” Hernandez said.
Source NM emailed requests for comment on Wednesday to the U.S. Department of Energy, but had not received a response by publication time.
The city is committing to selecting 30 pilot homes in the first year, and anticipates adding another 40 in the second year, much smaller than the initial scope. Hernandez said she’s seeking additional funding from outside grant sources, but doesn’t know if the program can continue beyond the first two years.
“I don’t know if there will be a third and fourth year,” she said. “And if there is, the amounts the residents will have to pay out of pocket will be much more substantial than we ever wanted, because we don’t have the money to help any more.”

Utah Sen. Mike Lee is bringing back a proposal that would allow the federal government to sell off several million acres of public land in Utah and other Western states.
Lee says it will open up “underused” federal land for housing and help communities manage growth — opponents, including a number of Democrats in Congress and environmental groups, say it’s an attempt to pay for tax cuts and warn it will jeopardize access to public lands.
Introduced Wednesday evening, Lee’s amendment to congressional Republicans’ budget bill, nicknamed the “big, beautiful bill,” renews an effort initially spearheaded by Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, and Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, that sought to dispose of 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and some 450,000 acres of federal land in Nevada.
But Lee’s proposal is much broader — rather than earmark specific parcels of land for disposal like Maloy and Amodei’s amendment, Lee wants to require the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture to sell off a percentage of land managed by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
According to the amendment, both agencies would be required to dispose of between 0.5% to 0.75% of land they manage, which amounts to about 2.2 million to 3.3 million acres. State and local governments would be allowed to nominate parcels of land, and would be granted priority to purchase.

Eleven states would be eligible — Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. Notably, Montana is exempt, and Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke was instrumental in sinking Maloy and Amodei’s original proposal, stating that selling public lands is a line he would not cross.
Though the scope is much bigger, Lee’s reasoning behind the proposal is the same as Maloy and Amodei’s — identify parcels of federal land near high-growth areas, and sell them at market value to local governments to use for housing, water infrastructure, roads and other development.
The amendment prohibits the sale of land that’s already designated, like national parks, national monuments, wilderness areas or national recreation areas. Land that has an existing right, like a mining claim, grazing permit, mineral lease or right of way is also off limits.
If it passes, the secretaries of the departments of interior and agriculture would have to prioritize nominating land that’s next to already developed areas, has access to existing infrastructure or is “suitable for residential housing.” The amendment also directs the secretaries to nominate land that’s isolated and “inefficient to manage,” and to reduce the checkerboard land pattern, the result of railroad grants in the 1800s that left small plots of private land scattered within swaths of federal land and vice-versa.
“We’re opening underused federal land to expand housing, support local development and get Washington, D.C. out of the way for communities that are just trying to grow,” Lee said in a video address. “We’re talking about isolated parcels that are difficult to manage, that are better suited for housing and infrastructure. To our hunters, anglers and sportsmen, you will not lose access to the lands you love. Washington has proven time and again it can’t manage this land. This bill puts it in better hands.”
Officials eye airport expansion, reservoirs and new roads under Maloy’s proposed public land sale

But that reasoning didn’t fly for a number of environmental groups, including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, which called Lee’s proposal an attempt “to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”
“Senator Lee’s never-ending attacks on public lands continue. His hostility stands in stark contrast with Americans’ deep and abiding love of public lands. Senator Lee’s plan puts Utah’s redrock country in the crosshairs of unchecked development,” said Travis Hammill, Washington, D.C. director for the alliance. “In Utah and the West, public lands are the envy of the country — but Senator Lee is willing to sacrifice the places where people recreate, where they hunt and fish, and where they make a living.”
The Center for Western Priorities, a public lands advocacy group, called Lee’s amendment “a shameless ploy to sell off pristine public lands for trophy homes and gated communities that will do nothing to address the affordable housing shortage in the West”; the National Wildlife Federation dubbed it a “fire sale” that is “orders of magnitude worse” than Maloy’s proposal; The Wilderness Society said it was “a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle” and warned that could spark political backlash.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.
The proposal was widely celebrated by the water district and local governments, who said it would help them make adjustments as the region continues to experience rapid growth. But nearby tribes, environmentalists and politicians from both sides of the aisle were skeptical.

In her latest court filings, Bird has criticized Marx, alleging the sheriff has, in essence, asserted that “federal immigration officials should not be trusted.”
Bird has also signaled that even if Marx were to comply with her demand that he disavow his past statements, the state is still obligated to strip Winneshiek County of funding, at least temporarily, based on those previous statements.

The lawsuit, filed in March in Polk County District Court, claims that Iowa law “requires stripping Winneshiek County of state funding until the sheriff follows the procedure to reinstate the funds” by disavowing his previous public statements on immigration enforcement.
The lawsuit stems from a Feb. 4, 2025, Facebook post in which, Marx, a Republican, stated that if his office received “detainer” requests to hold immigrants suspected of lacking legal status, and those requests were not vetted and approved by the courts, they would be rejected by his office.

In his post, Marx distinguished between detainer requests of that kind and what he called “valid” judicial warrants and court orders. He wrote that “the only reason detainers are issued is because the federal agency does not have enough information or has not taken the time to obtain a valid judicial warrant.”
In recent court filings, Bird claims that assertion by Marx is false, but that even if it were true, that’s not a defense since Iowa Code Chapter 27A clearly prohibits Iowa law enforcement officers from discouraging cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
“The court need not go down this rabbit hole,” Bird said, referring to the accuracy of Marx’s statements, adding that Chapter 27A “does not turn on whether the discouragement to cooperate with federal law is true or false… Whether Marx’s post was ‘an opinion’ or a statement of fact is irrelevant to whether he intentionally discouraged enforcement of immigration law.”
Bird: State funds for Winneshiek County must be denied
Before filing the lawsuit, Bird provided Marx with specific language to include in a public statement disavowing his Facebook post, written in the first-person to appear over Marx’s signature. Although Marx’s office deleted the Facebook post, Marx did not publish the statement authored by Bird, who then sued, seeking a court order declaring Winneshiek County to be ineligible to receive any state funds.
Bird is now contesting Marx’s request that the court dismiss the case.
“Marx’s removal of his Facebook post after the attorney general initiated this enforcement action does not moot the case,” Bird argues in a court filing. “Marx has not issued a public retraction of the statement, so his violation is ongoing … Just deleting the offending Facebook post was not, alone, enough to bring Marx back into compliance. Without more explanation of what was wrong with the post, the untrue allegations remain unrebutted and the discouragement caused by the initial post remains ongoing.”
Bird also argues that even if Marx were to fully comply now with her request to disavow his previous statements, Iowa law still requires the state to temporarily strip Winneshiek County of state funding.
The law, Bird has argued to the court, “requires a state-funds denial whenever Chapter 27A is violated — no matter whether the violation persists throughout the litigation … To find otherwise would allow local entities to avoid liability for violating the law by ceasing to violate the law as soon as an enforcement action begins.”
In her court filings, Bird also notes that “the Legislature clearly intended a local entity to face some punishment for a violation because it does not allow a petition for reinstatement (of funds) until ‘no earlier than ninety days after the date of a final judicial determination.’”
In response to the lawsuit, Marx and Winneshiek County have each asked to be removed from the case, prompting the attorney general to characterize the county’s request as “odd” given the amount of money that’s at stake.
“Though millions of dollars of its state funding is on the line, Winneshiek County makes the odd request to be removed from the case,” Bird stated in a June 6 court filing. “Given the financial consequences, the state assumed that the county would want to have a say in this litigation.”
As for Marx’s request that he be dismissed as a party to the case, Bird has told the court “the state does not hold strong views on the issue of which defendant best represents the county’s interest … If Marx wants to put Winneshiek County’s state funding at risk and then not defend his actions in court, so be it.”
A hearing date on all of the motions now before the court has yet to be scheduled. A status conference on the case is scheduled for Friday, June 13.

(Nicole Neri/The Minnesota Reformer)An effort to pass sweeping reforms to the laws governing homeowners’ associations and their property management companies largely failed in the Legislature this year, despite a chorus of complaints from homeowners about surprise bills and conflicts of interest. 
But lawmakers did approve the creation of a new Common Interest Communities Ombudsperson within the Department of Commerce, who will be charged with mediating disputes between homeowners and HOAs.
The ombudsperson, however, will have no authority to enforce agreements or offer legal advice. Their main responsibilities will be to create and disseminate plain-language explanations of common provisions in HOA documents; provide “informal” mediation services; and offer advice to lawmakers on issues affecting common interest communities. “Common interest communities” is the legal umbrella term for HOAs and condo associations. 
The creation of the ombudsperson’s office is one small win for the bipartisan group of lawmakers who sought to give homeowners more explicit rights and powers, while reining in property management companies and HOA boards.
The Reformer has reported on the stories of homeowners who were surprised with huge bills for repairs they didn’t think were necessary. At least one property management company also owns a construction firm, raising questions about conflicts of interest.
After the conclusion of the 2024 legislative session, a working group of lawmakers, homeowners, housing advocates and representatives of property managers gathered regularly to weigh how the state could empower homeowners in the face of rising complaints against unrestrained homeowners’ associations and property management companies.
The group came up with more than 150 recommendations, of which 41 made it into the final report to the Legislature. Many were incorporated into a bill that passed in the Senate, but not the House. 
That bill would have required HOA boards or property managers to solicit at least three written bids for all repair jobs valued at more than $50,000; blocked cities from requiring HOAs as a condition for approving a housing development; required HOAs to create and distribute a schedule of fines and fees; and to adopt a dispute resolution process.
None of those measures passed. 
The Minnesota chapter of the Community Associations Institute, which represents HOA boards and property managers across the state, backed the creation of the ombudsperson, but largely opposed other aspects of the HOA reform legislation. 
The organization got its members to show up on the Capitol in early April to rally against the more controversial aspects of the HOA reform package; many wore “I  my HOA” shirts. 
“[The ombudsperson] is a commonsense solution to the complaints that we all have heard about homeowners and boards not understanding their rights and obligations that exist under the current laws,” CAI lobbyist Phaedra Howard said. “It is our hope that lawmakers will give this solution a chance to work before trying to make additional unnecessary changes to the existing statutes that have worked and continue to work well for our state.”
Opponents of the larger reform package worried that the bill would require more man hours from the volunteers who staff HOA boards, or force homeowners to pay property management companies and attorneys to bring the association into compliance with the new rules. Some were also concerned that the scrutiny and additional work would disincentivize homeowners from joining their HOA board, many of which are already struggling to recruit volunteers.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250402_0093-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

California and 10 other states immediately sued and the governor ordered the air board to craft a new mandate.,"In summary
Trump signed measures today revoking waivers for the state’s mandates that clean up car and truck exhaust and ramp up sales of electric vehicles. California and 10 other states immediately sued and the governor ordered the air board to craft a new mandate.


President Donald Trump this morning signed three measures that block California’s mandates to phase out gas-powered cars and clean up diesel trucks. And California immediately struck back with a lawsuit and a vow to continue setting standards.
The move by Trump and Congress deals a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles and could upend its decades-long authority to clean up its air pollution, which is the worst in the nation.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating California’s electric vehicle mandate,” Trump said at the White House. “And they’re never coming back.” He said the state’s zero-emission car phaseout “has been a disaster for this country.”
Last month, Congress used the Congressional Review Act to revoke three waivers that the Biden administration granted to California to set standards phasing out gas-powered cars and diesel trucks. Trump’s signing makes that official. The dispute between California and the Trump administration and Congress highlights the growing political division over electric vehicles and air pollution policy.
Many legal experts, along with the Government Accountability Office and Senate Parliamentarian, said Congress has no authority to revoke the waivers.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed suit against Trump  and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, arguing that it’s an unlawful use of the review act.
“Trump’s all-out assault on California continues – and this time he’s destroying our clean air and America’s global competitiveness in the process. We are suing to stop this latest illegal action by a President who is a wholly-owned subsidiary of big polluters,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement today. 
Ten other states that are enforcing California’s emissions rules joined the lawsuit — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
Newsom today also issued an executive order that reaffirms the state’s commitment to phasing out gas and diesel-powered vehicles. He directed the Air Resources Board to craft another mandate for cars and trucks — to either bolster its existing mandates or replace them in case they lose in court.
Newsom also directed the air board to create a public list of automakers and truck manufacturers that are following California’s emissions rules, and companies that take early action to convert fleets to zero-emission trucks “regardless of the status of those regulations under federal law.” And he ordered state agencies within 60 days to determine what more can be done to help consumers with the transition to electric vehicles, including eliminating obstacles to building more charging stations.
Because of its highly polluted air, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards in the 1967 Clean Air Act. Before now, the federal government has never blocked any of California’s dozens of rules.
Under California’s mandate enacted in 2022, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.
Congress also blocked California’s 2020 Advanced Clean Trucks rule, an unprecedented measure that requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. A third vote revoked the waiver for a 2020 state regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses..
Trump said his actions mean those rules “are fully and expressly preempted by the Clean Air Act and cannot be implemented.”
“Our Constitution does not allow one State special status to create standards that limit consumer choice and impose an electric vehicle mandate upon the entire Nation,” he wrote. (California’s mandate applies only to vehicles sold in the state; the other states agreed to enact the same rules.)",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/072922-EV-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-CHARGING-MHN-04-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Free.,Abrego Garcia lawyers want Trump administration fined for defying court orders,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abrego-garcia-lawyers-want-trump-administration-fined-defying-court-orders,,"WASHINGTON — The lawyers for wrongly deported Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia late Wednesday requested civil fines be levied against Trump administration officials for repeatedly ignoring court orders — including from the U.S. Supreme Court — to bring their client back from El Salvador to the United States.In the filing, the attorneys asked Maryland District Judge Paula Xinis to impose court sanctions on the government for evading discovery requests that attempted to determine steps taken to return Abrego Garcia. The Trump administration has admitted his deportation to a notorious mega-prison in March was an “administrative error.”“For nine weeks, the Government defied this Court’s order, affirmed by a unanimous Supreme Court, to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States following his illegal removal to El Salvador,” according to the filing.In addition to fines on the government for failing to comply with court orders, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers suggest “Courts may impose monetary sanctions against government attorneys personally” and “The court may go even further and prohibit the government from reimbursing its attorneys for their costs.”And they note the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals “has affirmed civil contempt sanctions for parties that have evinced ‘disregard for the discovery process,’ such as by failing to produce discovery materials pursuant to a court order, that mirrors the conduct of the Government in the instant case.”Timing for Tennessee indictment questionedAbrego Garcia was brought back to the United States on June 6, but to face a criminal indictment on the accusation he took part in human smuggling of people in the country without legal authorization. He is currently detained and will face an arraignment before a Nashville judge Friday.His attorneys questioned the timing of the indictment, noting that while Attorney General Pam Bondi “declined, when asked by reporters, to state when the criminal investigation began, public reporting indicates that it started in April—around the same time that this Court ordered expedited discovery into the Government’s apparent defiance of Court orders.”“While the Government was telling this Court one thing and the world something else, it was secretly working to charge Abrego Garcia with two felony immigration charges based on alleged conduct that occurred years ago—and that it previously trumpeted in the media as justifying his removal,” according to the filing.The attorneys specifically cite possible sanctions against Department of Homeland Security attorney Joseph N. Mazzara, based on a New York Times story where Mazzara allegedly said the Trump administration was trying to keep Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.“Divining the identities of these officials is made difficult by the noncompliance itself—although at least a few, such as Mazzara, are already known—which is why it is appropriate for the Court to order an investigation into which Government officials willfully evaded the Court’s discovery orders,” according to the filing.Continuing the court caseThe attorneys are pushing to continue with the discovery process in order to identify the steps taken or the involvement of any other government officials who defied the court orders to return Abrego Garcia.“The lengths the Government has gone to resist discovery relating to these core questions raises a strong inference that the Government is trying to hide its conduct from the scrutiny of this Court, the Plaintiffs, and the public,” according to the filing. “What the Government improperly seeks to hide must be exposed for all to see.”The Trump administration on June 6 moved to dismiss Abrego Garcia’s civil suit filed in federal district court in Maryland, arguing it is moot after Abrego Garcia landed in the U.S. to face criminal charges in Tennessee.But Abrego Garcia’s lawyers are pushing to keep his civil case open in pursuit of the potential sanctions cited in the latest brief.“Until the Government is held accountable for its blatant, willful, and persistent violations of court orders at excruciating cost to Abrego Garcia and his family, this case is not over,” according to the brief by Abrego Garcia’s attorneys filed Sunday.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists is urging insurers to continue covering vaccinations during pregnancy in an open letter signed by 30 prominent professional health organizations.
Pregnant patients and their infants are vulnerable to complications from COVID-19. In the letter to payers and insurance companies released this week, ACOG stressed the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and how they protect babies and pregnant people. It was signed by prominent professional groups including the American College of Physicians, Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Public Health Association.
The letter follows U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to eliminate the recommendation for COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children and healthy pregnant patients, sidestepping an established decision process by scientists. Kennedy, who has made false claims questioning vaccine safety, earlier this week fired all 17 experts on the federal vaccine advisory committee panel, replacing them with eight new members, four of whom have spoken out against vaccines.
The Trump administration’s moves have alarmed health experts, who worry about coverage and access to the shot amid the agency’s dismissal of science.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

“We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” the letter reads. “Given the historic gaps in research, investment, and support for women’s health, it is essential that all aspects of obstetric and gynecologic care — including COVID-19 vaccination — be grounded in the best available scientific evidence.
Studies have shown babies born following a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy have a higher risk of low birth weights, stillbirth and respiratory distress, and data demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
Pregnant women who contract COVID-19 are also at higher risk of complications such as blood clots, are more likely to be hospitalized in intensive care units or to need ventilators, and are at a higher risk of death, the letter notes.
Payers should make the vaccine available to “pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” the letter reads. Without insurance, a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 shot can cost roughly $140 for adults.
Following the recommendation rollback, public health officials in some states have emphasized their support of COVID-19 vaccines.
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

The Wisconsin Department of Health Services, for example, said it “continues to recommend the current COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy and for every person 6 months and older,” noting that newborns “depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection.” Wisconsin Medicaid will also continue to cover the shot, the department said in a media release.
Officials in Georgia also said they expect continued coverage of the shot.
In Washington, a spokesperson for the state health agency told local media that the department is advising pregnant people to speak with their provider “to determine if receiving a COVID-19 vaccine is best for them.”
During this year’s legislative sessions, at least seven states introduced legislation aiming to ban or limit mRNA vaccines. Instead of using a weakened or dead version of the actual virus to stimulate an immune response, mRNA vaccines use a genetic code created in a laboratory to tell the body’s cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response. The Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA technology.
“The COVID vaccines were a remarkable scientific accomplishment, and they remain the best tool that we have to prevent severe outcomes associated with COVID infection,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, ACOG president, wrote in a statement. “Ob-gyns know that COVID infection during pregnancy can be incredibly dangerous for our pregnant patients — and we know that the vaccine can protect both them and their infants after birth.”
When patients are “forced to pay out of pocket, or to cover high cost sharing,” he wrote, “they are less likely to be able to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”

The protest was one of over 1,000 planned across the country. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a court brief Thursday in support of California’s lawsuit looking to block President Donald Trump’s federalization and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles. 
More than 20 attorneys general from Democratic-led states signed onto the brief in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that says Trump’s actions are “unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic.” 
Trump has ordered a detachment of 700 U.S. Marines and thousands of National Guard troops to deploy to L.A. over the objections of state and local leaders, the first such move by a U.S. president since 1965. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sued to block the deployments, which he said “crossed a red line.”

The attorneys general said in the brief supporting Newsom’s case that the circumstances necessary for the president to legally federalize the National Guard are not present.
“By calling forth troops when there is no invasion to repel, no rebellion to suppress, and when state and local law enforcement is fully able to execute the laws, the President flouts the vision of our Founders, undermines the rule of law, and sets a chilling precedent that puts the constitutional rights of Americans in every state at risk,” the brief says. 
The memorandum Trump issued authorizing the military escalation is not specific to L.A. or California, leaving open the potential for similar responses in other states. He says the action was necessary to protect U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents and the broader public amid demonstrations that have damaged property. 
The amicus brief says court intervention is “vitally necessary to vindicate state sovereignty and protect the States’ National Guards.” It says each of the involved states are implicated by the “unlimited scope” of Trump’s memorandum, which allows him to deploy National Guard troops of any state for 60 days. 
Democratic leaders in Colorado decried the Trump administration’s response, and Colorado anti-ICE protests have grown since the escalations in L.A., with more than 1,000 people gathering outside the Colorado Capitol Tuesday night. 
Weiser, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said the president must have a legal reason to federalize National Guard troops and that he “can’t just make up an emergency out of thin air.” State governors have authority over their National Guard units, but in certain circumstances, such as the danger of invasion, rebellion, or inability to enforce laws, the president has the authority to “federalize” them. 
“President Trump’s decision to deploy armed soldiers into the streets of our cities to engage in civil law enforcement violates our laws and Constitution and undermines the liberties we hold dear as Americans,” Weiser said in a statement.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)State government entities in New Mexico that act like courts when they resolve disputes can claim immunity from civil rights lawsuits, the state’s highest court ruled earlier this month in its first interpretation of the 2021 New Mexico Civil Rights Act.
However, the New Mexico Court of Appeals must still figure out whether the state’s horse racing regulator was acting like a court when it disciplined a horse trainer in the summer of 2021.
The New Mexico Supreme Court on June 2 ruled that state government entities sued under the New Mexico Civil Rights Act can claim “judicial immunity,” but stopped short of saying whether the New Mexico Racing Commission is immune from civil rights claims in this particular case.
The justices laid out a framework for determining when agencies under the state’s executive branch can use the defense against claims stemming from “quasi-judicial adjudicatory proceedings,” like disciplinary action.
Joshua Kastenberg, a law professor at the University of New Mexico, told Source NM the Supreme Court’s ruling preserves the law as the Legislature intended it.
“They wanted to make sure that the citizens would keep the state government accountable, except in the judicial arena,” Kastenberg said in a phone interview on Thursday. “So it’s a victory for all New Mexicans, but I don’t know if we can immediately say it’s going to benefit people other than it’s going to maintain that important balance of a functioning government and government accountability.”
Dispute over horse trainer’s license
Horse trainer Bradley Bolen alleges the Racing Commission violated his state constitutional rights by pursuing a vindictive prosecution against him. He argues the commission disciplined him in retaliation for advocating that his assistant trainer Isidro Rodriguez’s license be reinstated in July 2021.
Bolen alleged that Ron Walker, chief steward of racing at Ruidoso Downs, and Director Izzy Trejo initiated disciplinary proceedings against him, and ultimately imposed a $500 fine that was suspended so long as he didn’t receive any more discipline for a year.
Bolen appealed to the board of stewards but, before the administrative hearing on his appeal, he filed a civil rights complaint in district court and withdrew his appeal.
The Racing Commission argued that when it disciplined Bolen, it was acting like a court, which entitled it to immunity from his civil rights claims. This is called a “quasi-judicial immunity” defense.
District Court Judge Joshua Allison ruled that the commission isn’t entitled to quasi-judicial immunity, and the commission appealed. Then the New Mexico Court of Appeals reversed and ruled that government entities can use this kind of defense in general, and the commission can use it in this case.
High court’s first swing at landmark law
The federal government and the United States’ 50 state governments have sovereign immunity, which means they cannot be sued unless lawmakers open up avenues to lawsuits, said Kastenberg, who teaches constitutional law, criminal law and evidence.
When the New Mexico Legislature wrote the state Tort Claims Act during the 20th century, it kept in place immunities that already existed, including judicial immunity, which is meant to protect judges from being sued for damages as a result of an allegedly corrupt decision, Kastenberg said.
“A judge, on the federal side or the state side, is supposed to be able to make their rulings free from the fear of public pressure or litigation, so that although their rulings may be wrong, they’re not pressured into making those rulings,” Kastenberg said.
In April 2021, New Mexico became one of the first states in the country to abolish qualified immunity through the New Mexico Civil Rights Act, making it possible for people to sue police officers and others in state court for constitutional rights violations.

This month’s ruling was the first time ever that the Supreme Court has interpreted the Civil Rights Act, the justices wrote. The new law preserved other kinds of immunity defenses, including judicial immunity, they wrote.
The justices sent the case back down to the lower court in order to analyze whether the Racing Commission was acting like a court when it pursued discipline against Bolen.

If the court finds that the Racing Commission wasn’t acting like a court, then it would be open to a lawsuit under the state Civil Rights Act, Kastenberg said.

“Bowen did not win in the sense that he hasn’t proven his civil rights were violated,” Kastenberg said. “He only won in the sense that he gets to have his day in court.”

In promoting his bill to fund professional sports stadiums, Missouri Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory warned about the potential hit to jobs and tax revenues if the state were to lose a team.
But on the floor of the Senate last week, he acknowledged that pride was also a prime motivator in his efforts to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals, both of which are being courted to move several miles away into neighboring Kansas.
A former University of Missouri football player, Gregory pointed to the Missouri-Kansas rivalry that dates back to the Civil War and characterized Kansas as “kind of an archrival.”

“We just let the state of Kansas poach, you know, really the pride and joy of the western side of the state, and I would say the entire state of Missouri?” he said in his floor speech. “And then I would also say, what’s next? What’s the next thing the state of Kansas is going to try and take from us?”
Days after the 2025 legislative session ended in May, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session for lawmakers to consider stadium funding and disaster relief bills. Last week, the state Senate approved Gregory’s stadium incentives bill in the middle of the night by a 19-13 vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the state House approved the measure by a 90-58 vote, sending it to the governor’s desk.
The bill would fund up to 50% of construction or renovation costs and is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion over 30 years, the Missouri Independent reported.
Stateline was unable to reach Gregory for comment.
Economists have panned the ongoing stadium bidding war between Missouri and Kansas — which has offered to pay up to 70% of new stadium costs — as a waste of taxpayer dollars. But Gregory’s comments highlight the emotional undercurrents frequently at play in sports stadium funding debates across the country.
Experts nearly unanimously agree that public subsidies for stadiums are a poor investment, but that hasn’t slowed a wave of local and state spending for billionaire team owners.

Washington, D.C., could spend more than $1 billion to move the Washington Commanders some seven miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site, described by the team’s controlling owner as the “spiritual home” of the NFL franchise.
Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who studies stadium deals, said these kinds of arguments ignore the economic reality of stadium subsidies.
“You’re not talking economics. You’re talking pure emotion,” he said.
Despite mounds of evidence showing the public does not fare well on stadium investments, he said lawmakers and mayors still tout the potential for jobs and new tax revenues with stadiums and arenas.
Oftentimes, teams and politicians stir fears about the possibility of losing franchises to another market to increase pressure, he said. But three of the most prominent stadium subsidy deals under consideration now — in Chicago, Kansas City and the district — involve teams looking to move within the same metro area.
“I would appreciate it if lawmakers were that transparent, and they’re like, ‘I don’t care how much this costs, there’s no price that’s too high for us to pay to keep them here,’” Propheter said.

‘Generations to get past’

But cities and states have more at stake than raw economics, said Irwin Kishner, a New York attorney who has represented pro teams in multiple stadium deals.
He likened the stadium debate to those surrounding the Olympics: Research has found that host cities generally spend well in excess of the revenue generated by the games. But cities and nations still fiercely compete for the chance to host the high-profile event.
“It elevates the status of venues,” Kishner said. “And I think it’s very much the same thing with stadiums and arenas.”
He said cities also face potential economic consequences of lost jobs and tax revenues if teams leave altogether.
Oakland, California, for example, lost both its pro football and baseball teams to Nevada after local stadium talks fell apart. The NFL’s Raiders now play in Las Vegas and MLB’s A’s are playing temporarily in West Sacramento, California, before moving into their under-construction stadium on the Vegas strip.
“What happened in Oakland is a classic example of what happens when a team doesn’t get their building in the way they want it,” Kishner said.
And those sorts of relocations can leave lasting marks, he said, pointing to the sour feelings that still persist in Brooklyn decades after MLB’s Dodgers left for Los Angeles. Other cities have similarly iconic teams, such as the NFL’s Chicago Bears.
“When push comes to shove, municipalities would be embarrassed to lose a team. I mean, could you imagine the Bears playing in St. Louis as an argument?” Kishner said. “I think Chicago would have something to say about that in a very emotional way. And by the way, these things take generations to get past.”
Currently, Chicago’s stadium discussions are more localized.
After first sharing plans to build a new stadium along Lake Michigan’s shore in Chicago, the Bears are now pursuing a massive football stadium development in suburban Arlington Heights. Despite introducing various tax measures aimed to benefit megaprojects such as stadiums, Illinois lawmakers ended their session on May 31 with no action on the matter.










My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal, but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.


– Illinois Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner


Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side, said lawmakers have little appetite to invest heavily in stadiums.
The MLS’ Chicago Fire just announced plans to privately finance a new $650 million professional soccer stadium in the city’s South Loop — the same area the MLB’s White Sox are also eyeing as they explore a new baseball stadium.
“The days of widespread public money for private stadiums without public benefit — those days are over, and that is not just a sentiment in the state of Illinois. I think this is a sentiment across the country,” Buckner said.
Still, he acknowledged the sway emotions can have in the matter. While the Bears leaving the city limits likely would not affect the region’s economy, he said, it would still prove a blow to morale.
“My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal,” he said, “but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.”

Money matters

Missouri’s stadium debate has been simmering for years now: The Royals first announced plans in 2022 to move downtown from their stadium on the outskirts of the city. And the Chiefs — who share the sprawling stadium complex with the Royals — quickly followed with talks of wanting a new or renovated stadium.
After voters in a county election last year soundly rejected extending a stadium sales tax to fund those plans, lawmakers across the border in Kansas passed legislation that would fund up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That measure expires at the end of June, pushing Missouri legislators to act.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said such deadlines are arbitrary and meant to exact political pressure.
While politicians once had plausible deniability about the pitfalls of stadium subsidies, the research is now overwhelmingly clear and well covered in the media, he said. (It’s been nearly a decade since HBO’s John Oliver dedicated an episode of his satirical news show to the folly of stadium finance.)

But politicians on both sides of the aisle continue to push stadium subsidies — whether they’re touting the potential for wider real estate development or intangibles such as team pride and fears of losing franchises.
“It’s this prescribed dance, where everybody sort of pretends to be doing due diligence, but at the same time, everybody knows it’s going to happen,” deMause said.
He said that appears to be the case in the nation’s capital.
In April, city and team officials for the Washington Commanders announced plans for a 65,000-seat stadium. The proposed deal, which must be approved by the full city council, would cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over eight years.
But deMause’s analysis of the plan determined the public will be spending well in excess of that figure because of billions in free rent and hundreds of millions in property tax breaks. He estimates taxpayers will pay or forgo at least $7.5 billion on the deal.
“Everybody in and around the D.C. Council seems to be saying, ‘Yeah, it sure is a lot of money, but the mayor really wants it, so it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can improve it some,’” he said. “It’s a little bit like saying, ‘World War II is going to happen — just try and keep the death toll down.’”
Last week, Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report it commissioned that projected the stadium would create billions in new economic output and local tax revenue in the coming decades — figures that were quickly disputed by skeptical economists and academics.
Still, much of the district’s stadium conversation has centered on intangibles such as hometown pride and nostalgia. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell waxed about his childhood memories attending games at the old RFK Stadium at an April event announcing the deal.
Sitting in front of a “WELCOME HOME” banner at that event, the mayor said the RFK site was “where they belong.”
“I want to start by saying welcome home,” she said.

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
For the first time in five years, the majority of low-income students across Tennessee will not receive supplemental grocery funds this summer to help bridge the months when they aren’t receiving school meals.
Tennessee this week will send one-time $120 payments to an estimated 25,000 low-income students in 15 counties to help pay for summer grocery costs. Tennessee’s largest counties, include Shelby and Davidson, are excluded from the program.
The program is a significant rollback of Tennessee’s previous summer food benefits initiative, which served an estimated 700,000 students across the state each summer since 2020 with the help of a state-federal partnership.
That program, known as summer EBT or SUN Bucks, ended this year when Gov. Bill Lee declined to continue the partnership, effectively rejecting an estimated $75 million in federal funds that provided the summer grocery benefits.
Signe Anderson, senior director of nutrition advocacy at the Tennessee Justice Center, called the decision to discontinue the federal EBT program “devastating” for food insecure families.
“Tennessee’s decision to serve fewer than 25,000 children in just 15 counties leaves vulnerable families with fewer options at a time when hunger is on the rise for Tennessee families,” Anderson said. “We have already started hearing from families who will not have the support this summer.”
Though many Tennessee school systems have other summer feeding programs to reach students when class is out of session, advocates in the state argue the programs can be restrictive or inaccessible for families with scheduling conflicts or transportation issues.

In Memphis, for example, around 100 different sites are serving meals and snacks at some point in the summer. However, the sites offer a patchwork of availability, with hours varying by location and some offering only a few days of meals.
Other providers are more flexible, like the dozens of YMCA locations across the state offering meal packs for pick up with a week’s worth of breakfast and lunch food. Still, advocates raise concerns about rural families who may live miles from a meal location.
The decision to end the federal EBT program sparked heated pushback from a Tennessee congressman and child advocates earlier this year who argued the federal dollars were an important tool to address food insecurity, a particularly concerning issue during summer months when some students lose access to the regular meals provided during a school day.
Amid questions from lawmakers about giving up the federal funds, Lee’s office announced a new, state-funded program to provide payments to a limited number of counties, which the administration said were selected due to the lack of summer feeding partners like the YMCA.
Tennessee Department of Human Services Commissioner Clarence Carter has referred to the scaled-back state program as a “fiscally responsible” approach. Lee’s administration cited the state’s share of administrative costs as one reason to discontinue the state-federal partnership first launched under the Biden administration in 2020.
However, it’s now costing Tennessee $3 million to distribute benefits in 15 counties, while under the federal program Tennessee was responsible for around $5 million in administrative costs to serve 95 counties.
“This is cruel to Tennessee families and fiscally irresponsible when the state could have served 700,000 children for less money if they had run the federal S-EBT option,” Anderson said.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The Louisiana Legislature overwhelmingly approved a $51 billion budget plan Thursday without funding for Gov. Jeff Landry’s signature private education voucher initiative, one that he initially promoted with much fanfare. 

Legislative leaders, especially in the Senate, had said for the past year that they weren’t going to fund the LA GATOR program in the budget cycle that starts July 1. Landy and state education Superintendent Cade Brumley pressed forward with launching the program anyway, attempting to force lawmakers into changing their minds with public pressure. 
In March, Brumley opened up applications for LA GATOR for the 2025-26 school year, even after Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said he didn’t think the extra slots would be funded. Now without the extra money from lawmakers, none of the nearly 30,000-plus students who applied for additional vouchers will have an opportunity to receive funding for private education. 

In the approved budget plan, lawmakers only included $43 million to pay for school vouchers for 5,600 students already attending private schools under a voucher program started more than a decade ago by former Gov. Bobby Jindal. Legislators rejected Landry and Brumley’s request to provide $50 million more for a more lenient, publicly-funded private education program that was supposed to include at least 5,300 more students. . 
Henry and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, have not committed to paying for more private education vouchers with public dollars in future years either.

Approximately three-quarters of the students who applied for LA GATOR this year are already attending private school, according to Henry and McFarland. It raises questions about whether extending vouchers to more families would actually help children escape inadequate public schools or simply subsidize families who are already sending their children to private institutions, Henry said. 

McFarland said on the state House floor Thursday that legislative leaders want “assurances that [the vouchers] are addressing the specific needs of those that are in failing [public] schools,” before providing more tax dollars to cover students ‘ private education.

Legislators have instead used some of the money Landry wanted for vouchers to continue a popular tutoring program for public schools that costs $30 million. Brumley has attributed Louisiana’s impressive gains on national reading assessments, in part, to the tutoring efforts. 

Another $18 million Landry wanted for LA GATOR will instead increase money sheriffs receive to house state prisoners in their parish jails. It raises the daily rate for holding approximately 15,800 state inmates in local lockups from $26.39 to $29.39.

So why subject them to a new tax when lawmakers could be making it easier — not more difficult — to access products that help them improve their health? (Getty Photo)Rhode Island lawmakers have slipped a new tax into the state’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget that could hurt people struggling with addiction and set back public health efforts in the state.
The proposal would institute a new and highly aggressive tax — nearly doubling the price — on tobacco-free nicotine pouches, a product that many adult smokers use to stop smoking. Unlike cigarettes, pouches provide users with a nicotine fix without the need to inhale deadly smoke. Users place a small, smokeless, pouch between their lip and gum, allowing nicotine to be absorbed into their bloodstream.
Unfortunately, nicotine pouches are often unfairly targeted by organizations and policymakers that base their attacks on misinformation about the products and their users.
As a licensed physician certified in the field of smoking cessation and a co-founder of a New England recovery clinic, I have spent more than 40 years treating patients who struggle with a variety of addictions including alcohol, narcotics, and nicotine. Most people with nicotine addictions are rightly focused on quitting one product in particular — cigarettes.
Health experts, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have recognized that tobacco and nicotine products exist on a “continuum of risk” with cigarettes by far posing the largest public health risk. This is because cigarettes require the user to inhale a deadly mix of chemicals that cause emphysema, cancer, and a wide range of health problems.
Nicotine, by comparison, is a highly addictive stimulant but is also non-carcinogenic. Therefore, it is in smokers’ best interest to move toward smoke-free products like nicotine pouches that pose substantially fewer risks to their health.
Reflecting this reality, the FDA recently authorized the marketing of ZYN nicotine pouches. In making this authorization, the FDA reported that “due to substantially lower amounts of harmful constituents than cigarettes” these nicotine pouches “pose lower risk of cancer and other serious health conditions.”
But rather than embrace the promise of these products, Rhode Island legislators are proposing a punitive tax that would make them significantly more expensive. They propose making nicotine pouches subject to the same excise tax of 80% of the wholesale cost for all smokeless tobacco products to nicotine pouches, effective Oct. 1. Other states like Maine, Illinois, and Minnesota have also taken a similarly misguided step to raise revenue.










Rather than embrace the promise of these products, Rhode Island legislators are proposing a punitive tax that would make them significantly more expensive.


Extending taxes to nicotine pouches is especially dangerous because we know there is an inverse relationship between smoking and income brackets. Households with less income are more likely to have smokers. Lawmakers rightly struck a proposed 50-cent tax hike on cigarette packs proposed in January in the governor’s budget. They should be making it easier — not more difficult — for them to access products better for their health.
Some tax supporters argue that smokers should only quit using pharmaceutical tools like gum, patches, and prescription medications, but my experience has been that these methods have a terribly low rate of success. Highly touted medications like Chantix work for less than 10% of people who try them and carry side effects like suicide ideation and psychosis.  
Excessive taxes on nicotine pouches are also not necessary to curb youth usage. Since the national age to purchase tobacco products was raised to 21 more than five years ago, youth tobacco use has sunk to its lowest levels ever. In fact, the most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey found that only 1.8% of young people reported using nicotine pouches.
When it comes to addressing the harm done by smoking, Rhode Island’s concerns should be on the nearly 10% of adults in the state who are cigarette smokers. These are the individuals who will be needlessly hurt by placing high taxes on products that could be key to overcoming their cigarette addiction.
As lawmakers seek to address Rhode Island’s budget shortfall, they should not do it on the backs of people who are seeking to make better choices for their health. An expensive tax on nicotine pouches is likely to make a small impact on the budget, but it will put a big dent in efforts to improve the state’s public health.

The money will go toward the purchase of the 200-acre Copper Crowne Equestrian Center in Opelousas. It was included in the state’s larger $50 billion budget plan passed Thursday. 
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said the facility was at risk of closure, and the purchase is necessary because it is “vital” to the horse racing industry. 
“It was a necessity to keep that facility open,” Henry said in an interview. 
Henry said there were discussions about whether to give the facility to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette or to LSU. Before the money was added into the budget bill, Henry said he had discussions with John Walters, LSU vice president for external affairs. 
Walters told the Illuminator he discussed the purchase with Henry, but that LSU did not ask for the facility and was not asked to approve the purchase. 
Walters said Henry told him it made more sense to give it to LSU than to ULL because LSU has a veterinary school and an AgCenter. 
Oliver Garden, dean of the LSU veterinary school, said he had not yet been “fully engaged” in conversations about the facility but added the school has a number of potential uses for it. 
LSU will receive the money for the purchase unless Gov. Jeff Landry uses his line-item veto power to remove it from the bill. 
The facility is currently owned by Harold Forman, a native New Orleanian in the construction business. Situated on over 200 acres, it is made up of a veterinary clinic, barns, an arena, a training track, a rehab facility and foaling and boarding facilities. 
Henry said the facility is valued at $7 million. The state will cover half the asking price, and the other half of the center will be donated to LSU.

Dr. Taylor Weckstein, a graduate of Harvard medical school, last year worked for several weeks in residency at the Indian Health Services in Shiprock, New Mexico. Her work included outreach trips in triple-degree weather. She saw people experience burns from concrete, severe dehydration and heat stroke, and the experience stayed with her.
“After seeing the suffering of some of the patients, I thought it would be really important to try and have data to look at these really stark health implications,” Weckstein told Source.
On June 9, the Journal of the American Medical Association published research Weckstein co-authored based on national emergency room visitation data in 2021 and 2022, which found homeless people visited emergency rooms for heat illness or injury at a rate 27 times higher than other people. While Weckstein expected homeless individuals to face greater exposure rates, the stark disparity surprised her.
“Heat stroke and heat-related-illness are preventable conditions and it’s pretty tragic that all those individuals are exposed to such dangerous levels of heat because there’s a lack of affordable housing,” Weckstein said. “As we’re trying to combat climate change, we need to consider which populations are most affected and how we can advocate for human-centered policies to protect those who are at greatest risk.”
Weckstein said further research is needed to better understand the scope of the issue and possibly break it out into regional trends.
“If anything, this research probably was an undercount of the magnitude of the problem,” Weckstein said, noting researchers only tracked heat-illness specific codes, and didn’t capture how extreme heat worsens kidney or heart conditions.
The study comes as New Mexico braces for a hot weekend — and rising temperatures in the years to come.

‘We have to be proactive, rather than reactive’
Dangerously hot temperatures forecasted in the coming days have nonprofit advocates and providers bracing for “life or death” impacts to unhoused people in New Mexico’s largest cities. Advocates said governments at all levels need policies, funding and data to better address the threat.
According to the National Weather Service Heat Risk Map, Albuquerque this weekend could hit triple-digit temperatures for the first time this year, and Las Cruces highs are projected to reach 103 and 104 degrees for several days, with nighttime temperatures hovering at 70 degrees — making it harder for the body to cool off.
Local New Mexico officials said they’re monitoring for heat threats and ready to take action during extreme heat.
But it’s the overall hotter temperatures as a result of climate change that pose a continued threat, not just triple-digit days, said Nathaniel Matthews-Trigg, a board member for nonprofit Healthy Climate New Mexico.
“In New Mexico when the temperature reaches 90 degrees, we see emergency visits increase for heat, so really, any time you’re getting into the 90s, there is a risk,” Matthews-Trigg said.
Rio Rancho, Albuquerque and Las Cruces recently topped a USA Today analysis of cities with the largest increase of high-heat days — 90 degrees and upward — since 1985: 39, 36 and 31 more such days, respectively.
Matthews-Trigg said rising heat threats, particularly for unsheltered people with substance use disorders and mental illness, mean that cities need to do more to offer cooler spaces, water and support.
“All of those organizations that are working with those most vulnerable, we need to bring them in on the conversation and really intentionally plan,” he said.  “We can’t just leave it for the emergency to occur and then we do something; we have to be proactive, rather than reactive.”

‘Life or death implications’
Local officials in Albuquerque and Las Cruces told Source they are monitoring the heat risk situation this weekend, but as of Wednesday did not plan to extend cooling center hours, unless a power outage or further needs arise.










 “When it’s very hot, it has life or death implications for people living on the street.” 


– — Rachel Biggs, chief strategy officer for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless


Doña Ana Assistant County Manager Steven Lopez said recent temperatures have not reached a threshold of 105 degrees on the heat index, also known as the “feels like” temperature. The county requires those high temperatures for several days to provide additional cooling sites, he said.
Outreach teams, which deliver water, hygiene kits, food and other supplies will be out late on Friday to “help people get stocked up” for the weekend, according to Nicole Martinez, the executive director with Mesilla Valley Community of Hope in Las Cruces.
Community of Hope operates an outdoor tent-shelter area, adding more shaded areas and misters. Martinez described a couple of close calls, with people overheating in the courtyard.
“It seems like we’re constantly assessing for heat exposure,” she said.
In Albuquerque, which the USA Today report described as “one of the hottest places in the country,” city officials emphasized long-term goals to address heat, such as planting more trees to increase shade and the ordinance requiring landlords to ensure rental units have cooling systems.
Services for homeless residents include increased outreach with delivery of water and supplies, along with increased referrals and transportation to city and nonprofit-run shelters, said Matthew Whelan, the deputy chief administrative officer at the city.
“When there’s extreme weather, it is always a concern for everyone in the city, but absolutely folks that are experiencing homelessness or at the top of that list,” said City of Albuquerque spokesperson Staci Drangmeister. “The city has moved away from opening up temporary cooling centers, as we have built out some more permanent infrastructure to support people and keep people out of the elements.”
Access to the Gateway Center, located on the far Westside, presents a hurdle for people spread throughout the city, said Rachel Biggs, chief strategy officer for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless, a nonprofit that offers health care for unhoused people.
“I think there’s still a need beyond what the shelter is able to provide,” Biggs said. “Especially during these really challenging times when it’s very hot, it has life or death implications for people living on the street.”
Biggs said Albuquerque could learn from Arizona’s responses to extreme heat and homelessness. She pointed to that state’s strategy of prepositioning supplies before heat events. More water, towels and multiple cool-down areas required additional funding and resources, but the strategy contributed to lower heat deaths in Arizona last year for the first time in decades. Better responses for heat impacts such as education on heat safety, along with distributing sunscreen, water and protective clothing, help triage, but fail to address the root problem.
“We have the solution,” Biggs said. “It’s housing. If we all come together at all levels of government working together to provide access to affordable housing for everyone that needs it, we will see an impact on our health systems, on mortality.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents will consider a roughly 5% tuition increase at its meeting next week after state appropriations fell well short of NU’s request.
Nebraska lawmakers in May approved a 0.625% increase in state dollars for the next fiscal year ($4.35 million) at NU. But regents last August asked for a 3.5% increase, mostly to cover inflationary costs. NU President Jeffrey Gold said that while the Legislature must balance its budget, “the other side of the coin” is that NU faces similar inflationary pressures to the rest of state government.
Gov. Jim Pillen, a former regent for 10 years, initially suggested a 2% cut of state funding to NU, but federal funding cuts and freezes helped ignite new negotiations.
“While we’re not a supermarket or a car dealership, we still have to buy the same dozen eggs, the same tomatoes to feed our students,” Gold told the Nebraska Examiner this week.

Lawmakers, Gold and Pillen landed at a new “compromise” to increase state funding by 0.625% next year and 0.625% over that new baseline in the following fiscal year, both short of the annual 3.5% increase regents asked for. The state runs on a two-year budget cycle, but NU passes an annual budget.
Gold said NU leaders studied tuition at peer institutions, as well as within specific colleges and programs so NU maintained competitive tuition rates. Most are within the lowest quartile or decile, he said, or the lowest compared to other universities and colleges.
As a first-generation college student, Gold said he always has concerns that tuition increases could hurt enrollment, and he’s focused on trying to keep college as affordable as possible.
“Not to say that it’s not a significant change in tuition and that it is essentially asking families and students to pay more for their education out of pocket,” Gold said. “It is still a very conservative approach, with our focus on remaining affordable long term into the future.”
Increased costs
Under the proposal, NU’s $1.1 billion “state-aided budget” would increase by $19.07 million, the result of new state dollars and increased tuition, minus $2.5 million in declining investments. 
It’s an overall spending increase of about 1.8%.
Operational expenses would increase by $37.44 million, but Gold is seeking $18.37 million in cuts to balance new expenses and revenues. The increased costs are:

$22.31 million for general operations.
$12.73 million for faculty salaries (faculty at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and the University of Nebraska at Kearney are unionized.)
$7.78 million for health insurance (assuming a 7.25% increase in premiums).
$1.64 million for utilities.
$793,507 for employee benefits.

The budget also seeks to expand the “Nebraska Promise” — free tuition for any Nebraska student whose family makes $65,000 or less — by about $1 million and invest $2 million in deferred maintenance. 
Another $1.5 million will go to maintain the “Presidential Scholars Program” to waive tuition and pay students with top scores on the ACT to attend NU, for a 50-student annual cohort. Regents had asked for matching state fund, which did not come.
Gold said campuses are proposing planned reductions that will be ready by the end of the month. He said administrators are committed to closing any budget gap while also turning attention to a growing set of legislatively mandated tuition remissions, waiving tuition for law enforcement, public safety workers, firefighters, first responders, veterans and more.
While Gold said it’s good to offer higher education to those individuals and often their families, the roughly $10 million cost next year means sustaining those programs get more difficult. NU continues working with Pillen and lawmakers to find a solution.
No budget for salary bumps
While there is a net increase in faculty expenses, the NU budget shows a $12.34 million decrease in nonfaculty expenses, meaning the status quo for staff also won’t be maintained.
Jordan Gonzales, president of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Staff Senate, said in May he was “deeply disappointed” after Gold announced the budget would include no allocation for general salary increases or across-the-board raises.

Gonzales told UNL staff that investing in them “is not just a matter of fairness, but a strategic imperative for the long-term health and success of the University of Nebraska.” He predicted “significant, negative consequences,” including diminished morale and productivity, declines in recruitment, increased staff turnover and higher workloads passed on to remaining staff.
“Investing in our people is also critical if we truly aspire an odyssey to the extraordinary, especially if we want to create and maintain an extraordinary culture and environment,” Gonzales wrote, citing Gold’s long-term strategic plan.
Gold had said campuses can pay for promotions, often needed for recruitment and retention, but that those costs would need to be made up on individual campuses.
Federal challenges
Outside of the general state-aided budget, the total $3.57 billion NU budget (including cash funds, auxiliary funds, federal funds and trust funds) estimates that NU will receive about $11.85 million less in federal funds. NU is estimated to receive about $740.7 million in restricted federal funds.
Gold said federal cuts would predominantly be dealt with on a campus-by-campus and college-by-college level, such as if a research grant is canceled or indirect cost recovery rates are dropped. He noted that the current congressional tax-focused bill — dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” — calls to significantly reduce federal research funding.
It could be harder to compete for federal research grants, Gold said, and if a research program is terminated, NU would try to repurpose those researchers. If not, they could lose their jobs.
“These are very, very significant changes, and there’s no easy solution to this across the country,” Gold said. “But we’re going to do everything we can to protect our faculty and our staff who are involved in these research-intensive programs.”
Next UNK chancellor
Regents are also set to officially confirm Neal Schnoor as the next UNK chancellor.

Gold said he is excited for the “right person at the right time,” someone who knows Nebraska, Kearney and UNK “extremely well” as a former faculty member and administrator. Gold said the public vetting process has been “astoundingly positive” and that Schnoor understands how to focus on enrollment, leadership development and make hard decisions.
Schnoor is currently the president of Northern State University in South Dakota.
“It will be with a great sense of pride that I will recommend Neal Schnoor to be the next chancellor of UNK,” Gold said.
If confirmed, Schnoor would start July 1 with a $355,000 salary. He would succeed former UNK Chancellor Doug Kristensen, who retired May 2024 after 22 years.
The regents will meet at 9 a.m. June 19 in NU’s Varner Hall in Lincoln.

Despite calls from students in previous meetings to keep tuition flat and help keep higher education affordable and accessible, the board approved 3% increases to resident undergraduate tuition at the University of Iowa and Iowa State University and a 2.7% increase at the University of Northern Iowa. Tuition and fees for other categories of students will also rise at varying rates.

One section taken out of the proposed tuition and fees was UNI’s proposed tuition and fees for nonresident undergraduate students from states bordering Iowa, which would have been equal to what resident undergraduate students pay.
Board of regents Chief Business Officer Brad Berg said during the meeting the board will vote on those rates at a later meeting, as Gov. Kim Reynolds line-item vetoed funding for the tuition program before signing education appropriations legislation June 11.
The board voted unanimously to approve all other proposed tuition and fee increases.
Anne Moore, a UI student and graduate research assistant in the university library system, said Wednesday during the board’s public comment period she paid more than $1,000 in mandatory fees in the last academic year — more than a monthly rent payment — even after she received a 58% discount as a union-represented graduate worker.
Fees for UI graduate students will increase by 3% for both resident and nonresident students in the upcoming year, according to the board document, bringing the total cost to $1,829.
International students face even higher fees, Moore said, and those surveyed by the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students, or COGS, have reported increased rates of food insecurity.
“While we struggle to have our basic needs met while pursuing higher education, the regents want to raise tuition and raise our fees even higher,” Moore said. “You are leaving students, workers and families wondering how they’re going to make up the difference.”
Members of the board of regents have a “duty to keep education accessible and affordable for the people of Iowa,” Moore said, and if they want to attract students and keep people in the state, they shouldn’t be “nickel and diming students” while approving multimillion-dollar capital projects and other programs.
“Education is a right, not just for the rich and white,” Moore said. “Keep Iowa education affordable.”
Board approves director, president pay
The board of regents also approved increases to compensation for board Executive Director Mark Braun and university presidents, with new pay for all positions starting July 1.
Regent David Barker said Braun’s base salary will increase to $176,384 and he will receive a new, two-year deferred compensation plan with planned annual payments of $230,000. Board President Sherry Bates will have “the authority to negotiate and finalize a retirement incentive agreement to be effective July 2, 2027,” Bates added.
Braun’s current salary is $154,000, according to state records.
UI President Barbara Wilson received a $65,000 increase to an $825,000 base salary and ISU President Wendy Wintersteen will see a base salary increase of $25,000 to $735,000 a year.
UNI President Mark Nook received an increase of $12,890, bringing his pay to $410,000.

Garlin Gilchrist at the State of the State speech, Jan. 24, 2024 | Anna Liz NicholsLt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, a candidate to try and become Michigan’s next governor, has joined with 20 other Democratic lieutenant governors in condemning President Donald Trump’s move to deploy the California National Guard and United States Marines against protestors speaking out against immigration raids in Los Angeles. 
As of Wednesday, 4,100 California National Guardsmen and 700 U.S. Marines were present in the greater Los Angeles area, ABC reports, with orders to defend federal buildings and law enforcement. About 500 of the National Guard troops deployed to the city have been trained to accompany agents on immigration raids, the Associated Press reports. 
Since Saturday, the Los Angeles Police Department has made nearly 400 arrests and detentions, with the vast majority stemming from protestors refusing to disperse at law enforcement’s request. Two men have been charged with possessing molotov cocktails while the Los Angeles district attorney announced charges against more than a dozen people Wednesday for crimes including assaulting peace officers, grand theft and vandalism.
In a statement, members of the Democratic Lieutenant Governors Association said they were “deeply disturbed by the chaos unfolding in Los Angeles caused by President Trump’s reckless abuse of power.” They accused the President of using communities as a political battleground for retribution and to project force and fear. 
“Deploying federal troops and threatening military action in our neighborhoods is not only unconstitutional, it’s profoundly dangerous,” they said. 
With California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis opposing the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines within the city, the Association offered its solidarity with their fellow Democratic executives. 
“The streets of Los Angeles – or any of our communities – should not be a stage for Trump’s political posturing. We stand united against this manufactured crisis, and we will defend the rights to peaceful protest and organize, without federal interference or intimidation,” they said. 
On Sunday, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and 21 other Democratic Governors issued a statement condemning the president’s action as an overreach of his authority.
Newsom filed a suit on Monday, arguing the federal government had overstepped, bypassing his approval as the commander-in-chief of the California National Guard in a situation where federal intervention was not needed. 
A hearing is set for Thursday afternoon.

(Photo by David Wren/SC Daily Gazette)A taxpayer-funded rail and cargo hub for the Port of Charleston is behind schedule and over budget, and legislators are hoping to learn more about those problems in the coming weeks.
The Navy Base Intermodal Facility in North Charleston will not open as scheduled on July 1. A sister project that would move cargo containers between port terminals by barges is on indefinite hold.

Lawmakers set aside $550 million from the state’s general fund for both projects in 2022.
Now, the state’s Joint Bond Review Committee is seeking answers from the S.C. State Ports Authority, which is in charge of building the cargo hub and barge system. A subcommittee that provides financial oversight of big-ticket spending is looking to schedule a meeting in July to hear from the ports authority.
“We need to hear from port leadership about the delay and whether it’s going to be two months, three months, nine months or 36 months,” said Sen. Sean Bennett, R-Summerville, a member of the fiscal oversight panel. “If it’s an extended period of time, that’s a concern for everybody.”
The ports authority declined to comment on the status of the cargo hub – a rail yard where cargo boxes will be transferred between trucks and trains operated by CSX Corp. and Norfolk-Southern railroads.
The maritime agency said Barbara Melvin, its president and CEO, will update the project in open session during a ports board meeting on Tuesday. She told a Charleston maritime group this week that the cargo hub won’t open until early next year.
Melvin also told the group that state lawmakers are aware of the delays, according to a report by The Post and Courier. But those interviewed by the SC Daily Gazette said they’ve been given little information.
Bennett said the state’s investment in the cargo hub could be hurt, depending on how long it takes before the facility starts making money.

“The longer the delay, the worse it gets,” he said.
Also at question is the project’s ballooning cost.
The project started with a $400 million price tag, which included repayment of a $51 million loan to pay for initial planning documents.
The cost had grown to $468 million, not counting the loan, when Melvin updated legislators a couple years ago. She said at the time that any cost overruns would be paid for by the ports authority. A current budget for the project was not available.
“These are the sorts of things that pique my interest,” Rep. Micah Caskey, R-West Columbia, said of the project delays and cost overruns. Caskey, also a member of the oversight panel, said the group is trying to coordinate a meeting time to learn more about the issues.
Potential project delays have angered legislators in the past.
The ports authority promised legislators the NBIF would open in mid-2025 when money for the project was first appropriated in 2022. In August of the next year, Melvin told the fiscal oversight committee the NBIF might not fully open until 2026.
That news didn’t sit well with the panel, which told Melvin to find a way to get the entire project built on time.
“It was never envisioned that it would be ‘26 before we opened and had everything fully completed and functional,” former state Sen. Nikki Setzler, then-chairman of the subcommittee, said at the time. Setzler has since retired.
Part of the delay has been due to disagreements between CSX and Norfolk-Southern over how their trains will access the container transfer site, which has been in the works for more than a decade.

Melvin has also blamed tariffs, trade uncertainties, a changing business climate and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that forces the ports authority to use union labor at new terminals – citing training issues – for the delays.
A Norfolk-Southern spokesperson said this week that the railroad is “not quite able to dive into those specifics at this time,” when asked when it expects to begin using the NBIF. The railroad referred further questions to the ports authority.
A CSX spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Ryan Johnson, a spokesman for North Charleston, said the ports authority has not told the city when the NBIF is expected to open.
The ports authority has long lobbied for a rail-based cargo hub near its waterfront terminals, saying the lack of on-dock or near-dock rail puts the Port of Charleston at a disadvantage to other ports.
Charleston is the only major East Coast port without such rail access.
“This critical infrastructure project will greatly enhance SC Ports’ capacity, allowing imports and exports to swiftly move between the hinterland and the Port of Charleston,” Melvin said in a statement last year.
About 300,000 containers, or roughly 25 percent of the port’s annual total, are moved by rail each year, with trucks handling the rest. The NBIF will have the capacity to nearly triple that number while potentially eliminating thousands of tractor-trailer trips along local roads and state highways.
Once completed, the 118-acre NBIF will have about 78,000 linear feet of track, a container stacking area, an administrative building, security booths, truck gates and six electric gantry cranes that span over tracks where cargo containers will be moved between trucks and trains.
The project also includes work to minimize the impact of rail traffic on local roads.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Floridians in more than 70 cities throughout the state plan to join nationwide demonstrations to protest the Trump administration on Saturday, prompting Attorney General James Uthmeier and other law enforcement officials to say they won’t hesitate to quash protests.
The protests, part of the “No Kings” movement, are set to take place the same day as the multimillion-dollar military parade in D.C. and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
Uthmeier, who along Gov. Ron DeSantis has been criticizing the protests in downtown Los Angeles against Trump’s immigration crackdown, said he wanted to put the public on notice before Saturday. Trump sent the California National Guard into the city despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom, and the California governor rejected DeSantis’ offer to send the Florida State Guard, according to the Miami Herald.
“If you want to wreak havoc and destruction in Florida, we have enhanced penalties to ensure you will do time, so we do not tolerate rioting. As groups talk about assembling over the weekend, we haven’t seen much of that in Florida,” Uthmeier said during a press conference in Brevard County.
However, protests are planned in all the state’s major cities, including in front of the Florida Historic Capitol in Tallahassee, according to the movement’s website.
The messaging from Uthmeier reflects Trump’s warnings that those who protest the D.C. parade will be met with “very heavy force.”
“If you resist lawful orders, you’re going to jail. Let me be very clear about that: if you block an intersection or a roadway in Brevard County, you are going to jail,” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey. “If you flee arrest, you’re going to go to jail tired because we are going to run you down and put you in jail. … If you throw a brick, a fire bomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains at because we will kill you.”
Uthmeier also announced that Florida Highway Patrol troopers would start patrolling the houses of federal immigration officials who believe they have been doxxed.

(Courtesy Indiana State Teachers Association)Nearly 300 Hoosier students will receive up to $40,000 each to pursue careers in education through the state’s Next Generation Hoosier Educators Scholarship program, higher education officials announced this week.
The Indiana Commission for Higher Education awarded 295 awards for the 2025–26 academic year. The renewable scholarship provides up to $10,000 per year for four years. In exchange, recipients agree to teach for five years at an eligible Indiana school or repay a prorated amount.
Now in its ninth year, the program aims to address the state’s ongoing teacher shortage by supporting students committed to staying in the profession.
“Teachers inspire confidence in the next generation and prepare students for future career success,” said Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Chris Lowery. “The Next Generation Hoosier Educators Scholarship is a key strategy to build Indiana’s future teacher workforce with high-quality talent. The students selected for this opportunity have the passion and determination to make a difference in classrooms across the state.”
The 2025-2026 application cycle drew a record 1,091 applicants — a 15% increase over last year — from 326 high schools across 89 of Indiana’s 92 counties, according to CHE. Of those applicants, 73% were high school seniors and the rest were current college students.
State lawmakers expanded the annual scholarships in 2023, increasing awards from $7,500 to $10,000. The previous 200-recipient cap was also lifted, and a one‑time $10,000 grant was introduced for students enrolled in approved “transition to teach” programs.
Funding for the program was reduced in the state’s new two-year budget passed earlier this year, however, with annual appropriations dropping from $12 million to $11.4 million. The cut was part of broader budget cuts across state government. It’s not yet clear how the reduced funding might affect future scholarship awards.
To qualify, students must meet academic criteria including ranking in the top 20% of their high school class, earning a 3.0 GPA or better, or scoring in the top 20th percentile on the SAT or ACT. Scholarship recipients must maintain a 3.0 GPA and complete at least 30 credit hours per year to remain eligible while in college.
The full list of scholarship recipients by county is available online at che.in.gov.

(Photo via Google Earth)One of Iowa’s largest nursing home chains is denying allegations that it fired a nurse in retaliation for her quality-of-care complaints to state regulators.
The chain, Care Initiatives of West Des Moines, is currently facing three separate whistleblower lawsuits stemming from unrelated incidents. The company operates 44 care facilities in Iowa.
In the most recent case, Tina Weber of Clemens states that from May 2021 through October 2024, she worked as a registered nurse at an unspecified Care Initiatives facility in Marshall County.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Weber claims that on Oct. 5, 2024, she witnessed an incident involving a resident with schizophrenia, using a wheelchair, and a human resources worker. According to the lawsuit, the two were engaged in an argument and when the resident attempted to leave in his wheelchair, the human resources worker grabbed the handles of the wheelchair, causing the resident to fall out of the wheelchair to the ground.
Weber reported the incident to the assistant director of nursing and recorded the incident in the resident’s chart. The next day, Weber alleges, the home’s director of nursing texted Weber, writing, “Could you strike out original note and when putting in about the wheelchair say she was assisting with the wheelchair and he put himself on the ground as she tried to de-escalate him and explain that he was not allow to smoke and the policy?”
Weber allegedly responded, “So not the truth?”
On Oct.  11, 2024, an administrator allegedly asked Weber to change her account of the incident in the resident’s chart. Weber refused. Later that day, the lawsuit alleges, a corporate employee of Care Initiatives instructed Weber to change the resident’s chart so it didn’t indicate the resident’s fall was the result of an altercation with the staff. Weber again refused and, the lawsuit claims, she then reported the incident to state regulators who forwarded it to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which oversees nursing homes.
Five days later, a state inspector visited the nursing home to investigate the matter, the lawsuit alleges. The next day, the lawsuit alleges, Care Initiatives fired Weber.
The lawsuit claims the company fired Weber due to her reports and complaints regarding the health, safety, and well-being of one of its residents. The lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for Weber’s firing.
In its response to the lawsuit, Care Initiatives says it “did not terminate or take any adverse action at any time against (Weber) for participation in any alleged protected activity, including her alleged reports/complaints-both internally and externally.” The company says that it acted in good faith, without malice or disregard of Weber’s rights.
A trial is scheduled for June 9, 2026.
‘Keep your mouth shut’
Care Initiatives is currently the target of two other lawsuits alleging a form of whistleblower retaliation.
In one of those cases, Tylene Schultz states that in the summer of 2022, she was hired at Fonda Specialty Care by its then-administrator, Jennifer Blair, to work in the home as a certified nursing assistant.
On Feb. 18, 2023, the home allegedly scheduled a temp-agency nurse, Becky Manning, to work the overnight shift due to a shortage of staff nurses. During the shift, a resident with a tracheostomy passed away about 2:25 a.m., according to the lawsuit.
State records indicate the resident who died was 87-year-old Marvin “Pete” Jacobs, who had undergone a tracheostomy and needed regular suctioning of his airway. The lawsuit claims Jacobs died because throughout the shift, Manning refused to numerous requests to suction Jacobs’ airway.
“Despite multiple requests by Schultz to suction the resident — over 10 times, from 6 p.m. on Feb.18, 2023, to 2:25 a.m., Feb.19, 2023 — Manning would not suction the resident, nor did she attempt to use the suction machine,” the lawsuit claims.
According to the lawsuit, after Schultz left the home at the end of her shift, she received multiple text messages from Blair that said, “Keep your mouth shut and keep your opinions to yourself,” along with instructions that she should not communicate with Jacobs’ family.
Later that day, Schultz was summoned to a meeting with Blair at Fonda Specialty Care. During the meeting, the lawsuit claims, Blair — who was allegedly was aware Schultz planned to call state regulators and report her concerns with Jacobs’ care — informed Schultz she was being fired due to “resident complaints.”
Manning was charged with felony wanton neglect of a resident of a health care facility and later was sentenced to two years in prison on a reduced charge of misdemeanor wanton neglect. Manning also entered into an agreement with the Iowa Board of Nursing in which she agreed to indefinitely suspend her practice of nursing.
Schultz’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for wrongful termination. Care Initiatives has denied any wrongdoing and alleges that Schultz’s dismissal was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory, and nonretaliatory business reasons.
A trial is scheduled for Aug. 4, 2026.
Caregiver helped resident call 911
The third current whistleblower case against Care Initiatives involves Kandus Jellison, who worked at the company’s Oakwood Specialty Care in Albia. Jellison has alleged she was fired in June 2022 after she intervened on behalf of a resident who was refused hospital care and then helped the man call 911.
Jellison sued Care Initiatives in part for allegedly violating the Iowa law that bars employers from taking action against workers for reporting dependent adult abuse or assisting with an abuse-related complaint or investigation.
Care Initiatives has argued that while it’s a crime for a company to retaliate against workers who assist with abuse investigations, the Iowa Legislature didn’t intend for workers to use such a violation as the basis for a civil lawsuit. A judge agreed and dismissed one element of the lawsuit, but let the remainder of the case proceed.
Care Initiatives has denied any wrongdoing in the matter, and a trial is scheduled for March 30, 2026.
A fourth whistleblower case against Care Initiatives was settled several months ago. In that case, Stephanie Schlegelmilch sued the company, alleging that while working as the director of nursing for the chain’s Avoca Specialty Care, she was terminated in violation of public policy.
Schlegelmilch alleged she was fired shortly after she confronted a regional nurse for Care Initiatives and questioned why she wasn’t wearing a mask during a COVID-19 outbreak in the home.
Care Initiatives denied any wrongdoing in the case, and the case was dismissed in December 2024 after an out-of-court settlement was reached.

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-12 16:11:09+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Community garden projects regroup after USDA grant terminations, forging ahead",Steph Quinn,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/12/community-garden-projects-regroup-after-usda-grant-terminations-forging-ahead/,"The USDA notified commmunity garden project leaders it had canceled their grants, saying they were engaged in DEI initiatives.","The three-person team behind a growing network of gardens and community spaces in Jackson’s Midtown neighborhood received word in February that they had been chosen to receive $10,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service. 
In April, that group – the Farm to Community team of the Jackson nonprofit Midtown Partners – was notified that they would not receive the funding. The team lost the federal money after the USDA terminated a $157,827 grant slated to help a dozen groups throughout Mississippi establish or sustain community gardens in underserved communities. The USDA canceled the grant, the notice said, because the nonprofit that had won the grant and chosen garden projects in Mississippi to receive the money, engaged in “diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.” 
That nonprofit, Community Resources Connection in South Carolina, declined to comment about the USDA decision but updated its website this week to say that “the Community Garden contract between USDA and CRC has been terminated because of the current administration’s change in priorities” and that no funds are available for the Community Garden program at this time.
Executive orders President Donald Trump issued in January kicked off a sweeping review of grants by the USDA, as the department sought to root out support for DEI programs Trump described as “radical and wasteful” and climate initiatives he said hindered the administration’s priority of “unleashing American energy.”
Though USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins has defended the department’s grant terminations as reducing waste, leaders of community garden projects throughout Mississippi said that past federal funding has enabled them to cultivate food self-sufficiency and community cohesion. Now lost grant opportunities are forcing them to adjust plans and look for alternative funding.
Linda Fondren, founder and executive director of Shape Up Mississippi in Vicksburg, said her organization lost $10,000 in federal funding due to the USDA’s cancellation of the same grant. Due to that loss, the nonprofit will postpone its fifth annual Youth Agriculture and Health Extravaganza Day, which has featured nutrition and agriculture classes, cooking demonstrations and a petting zoo in past years.

Norma Michael, founder of the Sharing is Caring Neighborhood Block Garden in Jackson’s Georgetown neighborhood, had planned to install a drip irrigation system using $1,000 from the same USDA-canceled grant. Though she was able to obtain the funding elsewhere, Michael said, the USDA’s decision on the grant was disappointing.
“I think that it’s disheartening that programs that help people that are underserved are being cut,” Michael said. “That just makes us even more underserved.”
Matt Casteel, farm consultant for Midtown Partners’ Farm to Community team, said past federal funding has helped the group to establish relationships and infrastructure to pursue its broader vision of a walkable network of community spaces across Midtown. 
“That’s something that we’re building as our bigger vision, is to be the resource and the mycelium, if you will, that connects and keeps that structure together,” Casteel said.
The team used a two-year, $98,041 Patrick Leahy Farm to School Grant to establish a teaching garden on the campus of Midtown Public Charter’s primary school and purchase hydroponic towers for the primary and middle schools.

Since the fall, the group has also hired lifelong Midtown resident Dewaskii Davis as farm coordinator.
Davis said he is passionate about empowering others in Midtown to participate in Farm to Community events, as well as start their own rain barrels and plant their own gardens.
“No cheat codes, no chemicals, just hard labor,” Davis said. “But it’s worthy and worth it at the end.”
Congress approved the Farm to School program as part of the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which mandated a minimum of $5 million to farm-to-school competitive grants annually to address hunger and improve children’s nutrition – a vital issue in Mississippi, where the childhood poverty rate is 23%. The USDA announced the cancellation of $10 million in fiscal year 2025 funding for that program in late March with no explanation. 
Though Midtown Partners’ 2024 grant was unaffected, the group had hoped to re-apply in a future funding cycle.
“I’ve applied for over $2.3 million in grants, and we’ve received about 250,000,” said Jina Daniels, Midtown Partners’ creative economy coordinator. “We keep at it. Every little bit helps.”
Prophetess Robinson, principal of the private K-12 Ron’s Brothers Academy in Picayune, said it’s difficult for her and her staff to find time to apply for grants on top of their teaching and administrative duties. 
Robinson applied for a Patrick Leahy Farm to School grant to replace the school’s garden, which was destroyed this winter in a fire that began on a neighboring lot. But she was notified that that program had been canceled before she received feedback on the school’s application.
“One of the kids just asked me, ‘Miss Robinson, are we going to do the gardening? What are we going to do?” 
Robinson said the school has put its plans for a new, bigger garden on pause. 
“There was no way we’d be able to do it just on our resources alone.”
Fondren highlighted the importance of Shape Up Mississippi’s robust network of volunteers and partner organizations in Vicksburg.
Although the loss of USDA funding was a blow, she said,Shape Up Mississippi will continue to hold public “U-Pick Days” at the group’s community garden – the result of a partnership with Alcorn State University and the city of Vicksburg – throughout the summer. Those harvests are split between local shelters and for families to take home. 
“If you could see the children, the families that come out and pick,” Fondren said, “it’s a social gathering. They are so excited about what is happening there.”

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Public health officials are responding to a spike in opioid overdoses in Douglas County by offering free, lifesaving drugs, including through a vending machine.
Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health called attention to overdose statistics in a social media post, stating the Kansas Department of Health and Environment identified 33 opioid overdoses between March and May in eastern Kansas. Douglas County accounted for a majority of emergency department visits in the area, double what would be expected in a two-month timeframe.
“This isn’t just a Douglas County issue. This is a nationwide issue that unfortunately claims people’s lives every year,” said Cara Hansuld, prevention services program manager at DCCCA, which provides community and social services. “It’s hard to say what the long-term effects are right now and if this is going to continue.”

While public health officials have been swift to make lifesaving drugs like naloxone accessible to the public, other local experts are emphasizing the need for awareness and education.
“It’s important for our residents to know what’s happening,” Hansuld said. “This indicates to me that there is more concentrated fentanyl or just a more dangerous strain of the substance that they’re seeking. It’s good for everyone to know so they can be prepared in case that happens to them or somebody close to them.”
DCCCA has funded a naloxone vending machine outside of a Lawrence Transit station near the University of Kansas campus since Feb. 2024, providing free nasal spray when residents enter their zip code. Douglas County residents also can request free naloxone and fentanyl test strips online through DCCCA’s website.
“This is a communitywide and national challenge that demands a coordinated, multifaceted response,” said Ryan Sztorch, senior director of crisis services at Bert Nash Community Mental Health Center in Lawrence. “Reducing stigma is a key part of that process.”
Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health provides naloxone and fentanyl test strips as well as education on how to use them. Executive director Jonathan Smith said it’s crucial to share accurate, timely information about the clinic’s resources to save lives.
“This is a moment for the community to be alert and educated about resources available to prevent overdoses from happening,” Smith said. “The most important thing we can do is act early, raise awareness, and make sure people know where to go for support.”
Organizations are working to spread awareness about the rise in overdoses across the county. For Douglas County, collaboration has been key in helping address the opioid crisis.
“Our community is fortunate to have a wide range of strengths and resources, and it’s only through collective action that we can make meaningful progress,” Sztorch said. “Each of these partners brings unique strengths — whether it’s providing treatment, coordinating care, distributing Narcan, or offering lifesaving interventions. This united front is a testament to the power of community and shared purpose.”
Bert Nash partners with first responders across the county to provide not only treatment but also mental health resources. Sztorch says that reducing the stigma of substance use means recognizing substance use disorders the same way we would other medical conditions, as well as their connection to mental health.
“Normalizing substance use disorders as medical conditions — just like diabetes or heart disease — is essential to saving lives,” said Sztorch. “We also need insurance providers to recognize and support treatment for substance use disorders on par with other health conditions. We know that mental health and substance use are deeply interconnected — addressing one often supports healing in the other.”
Although experts haven’t identified a root cause to the uptick in overdoses, they agree the goal is to continue educating Douglas County residents and providing resources to those in need.
“Our focus right now is on preventing further harm,” Smith said. “The resources are here, and we want to make sure our community knows how to access them.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9401-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Estenson photo provided by the North Dakota Legislative Assembly. Other photos provided by the candidates.)A North Dakota Republican Party fixture and two relative newcomers are seeking to lead the state party during a time of division between establishment and populist factions.
Shane Goettle, a lobbyist who served in U.S. Sen. John Hoeven’s administration, is among the candidates to succeed Sandi Sanford as chair of the state party. Goettle, of Mandan, is a former North Dakota national committeeman who lost the spot last year during a state convention that saw several endorsements go to less traditional candidates.
Others to announce their candidacy are former state Sen. Judy Estenson of Warwick and District 8 NDGOP vice chair Matthew Simon of rural Bismarck. The North Dakota Republican State Committee will gather in Bismarck on Saturday to elect a new chair for the next two years.
Sanford, who narrowly won over Perrie Schafer two years ago, is not seeking reelection. 
Republicans control all elected statewide and federal offices in North Dakota and hold supermajorities in the state Legislature. The election of a new party leader comes a year after a contentious state primary in which several conservative Republicans sought to oust more moderate incumbents and longtime legislators skipped district endorsing conventions citing concerns of an unfair process.
Incumbent Republican legislators see big wins over primary challengers across North Dakota

Bob Harms, a former NDGOP chair from 2013 to 2015, said the party needs a leader who can bring unity.
“Right now, we need somebody who can help bring the party together to reduce some of the division and the rancor and the discord that exists, and much of the gamesmanship that is out there on both the right and the left of the party,” Harms said.
Goettle, who has held previous roles in the state party, said he’s running for chair because he believes the NDGOP needs steady, fair and principled leadership. 
“We can have our differences. That’s OK,” Goettle said. “We can even battle that out somewhat within the party, but that’s where it should happen … with debate, with dialog and with a lot of patience.”
Estenson said in an announcement that the election comes at a pivotal time for the NDGOP.
“Our party stands at a crossroads,” Estenson said as she announced her candidacy, emphasizing a need to “reaffirm our commitment to conservative principles.”
In an interview, she said she hopes to bring more unification and openness to the party.
“You want to do things in a very fair, transparent way and I want our districts to do the same,” she said. “It all starts at the grassroots and I want our districts to be committed to that same thing.”
Estenson represented District 15 during the 2023 legislative session. A judge’s ruling in a redistricting case shifted district boundaries and Estenson lost election in 2024 in District 9. She now serves as NDGOP District 9 chair.

Simon said he would like to see more transparency and open forums in the Republican Party process.
“Right now, there’s a lot of mystique behind what we actually do as a party at the state level,” Simon said. “I think that could be fairly easily resolved by just more public engagement.”
He also said divisions between factions within the party are not “irreparable,” but in-depth discussions need to be had on “what it is to be a Republican.” Simon said the party platform is supposed to be the unifying force within the party that represents an 80% consensus of its membership.
Sanford said she decided against seeking reelection after consulting with members of the state and national party.
“I just decided that I’m not the person to continue and I think it’s best for someone else to jump in,” Sanford said.
The NDGOP reorganization meeting is closed to the public.

A group seeking to upend a new minimum wage law passed in February submitted a petition for referendum to the Michigan Board of State Canvassers on Wednesday – a move that restaurant groups have called misguided.
Meanwhile, supporters of the proposed referendum submitted by Voters to Stop Pay Cuts said the Michigan Supreme Court upheld 2018 voter-initiated laws to change the state’s minimum wage law and that the Michigan Legislature should have let those laws go into effect without meddling with them.
One Fair Wage, which helped to spearhead the movement to change the minimum wage law only to have their attempts circumvented by the Michigan Legislature – twice – in a statement said workers are now prepared to fight the law head on.
“The Michigan Supreme Court ruled that these wage increases should be implemented, yet lawmakers rolled them back before they even took effect,” said Saru Jayaraman, president of One Fair Wage, in a statement. “We’re mobilizing to ensure voters – not politicians – have the ultimate say in whether these protections are upheld.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In proposed voter referendum language submitted to the Board of State Canvassers on Tuesday, Voters to Stop Pay Cuts said it is seeking to repeal Public Act 1 of 2025, which was born from Senate Bill 8, introduced by state Sen. Kevin Hertel Jr. The Michigan Legislature passed the bill in February and the bill was signed into law by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shortly thereafter.
The act was a compromise with tipped-wage workers and restaurants who foretold doom and gloom if Michigan phased out tipped wages and instituted a more than $12 an hour minimum wage. That was likely without action from the Legislature after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that two voter-initiated laws passed in 2018 should have gone into law as written. The Legislature gutted the 2018 changes to minimum wage, tipped wages and paid sick time in the same session they were passed, which prevented the issues from going before the voters. 
It was a controversial move known as “adopt and amend” because legislators took up the legislation, circumventing voter input, and then amending them in the same session. Organizers who supported the initiatives sued and argued the scheme was unconstitutional. The Michigan Supreme Court’s liberal majority agreed and struck down the amended laws in a landmark 4-3 decision. The state’s high court also determined that the Legislature had no authority to adopt voter-initiated laws and amend them in the same session.
With that, the laws were set to go into effect in 2025, but a movement supported by tipped wage workers, restaurant and hospitality business owners rallied support to have the Legislature step in and amend the laws – which was now allowed because the appropriate time had passed for the Legislature to amend the laws. Whitmer signed the bill in February.
The resulting Public Act 1 of 2025 set minimum wage $12.48 in 2025, $13.73 in 2026, and $15 an hour starting in 2026. The act also kept tipped wages intact and raised their percentage of hourly wage on a graduated scale up until 2030, much like it did with non-tipped workers’ minimum wage.
Voters to Stop Pay Cuts would like that law exorcised from statute, with referendum language arguing that Public Act 1 reduced the minimum wage for tipped workers and changed the way future inflation adjustments for minimum wage increases occurred in the future.
A notice from the board notes a suggested petition summary with explanatory materials is due on June 18. Canvassers plan to meet to discuss the summary on June 27. The deadline for the board to either approve or reject the summary is July 10.
The Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association squarely opposed the effort.
“PA 1 of 2025 represents that rare outcome voters hope for from their elected officials but rarely experience – a true bipartisan solution in the midst of a polarized environment,” said MRLA President and CEO Justin Winslow in a statement. “This particular diamond in the rough was crafted after extensive input from tens of thousands of Michigan servers, business owners, and community diners ultimately passed by both the Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate, and signed by Governor Whitmer.”
Winslow called the effort misguided and said Voters to Stop Pay Cuts was just One Fair Wage under a new name. He said suspending Public Act 1 would do nothing but slow the pace toward a $15 minimum wage.
“After six years of legal uncertainty, our industry finally has clarity and a responsible path forward. Michigan’s restaurant workers and operators deserve certainty, not the chaos that would result from suspending thoughtful, bipartisan legislation,” Winslow said. “We urge voters to decline to sign this irresponsible attempt to undermine worker-focused legislation that reflects the voices of actual Michiganders, not out-of-state interests.”

In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, the U.S. Department of Labor is alleging that Rocio Correa-Mata, 33, of Iowa City, as the sole owner and primary manager of the Mexico Lindo Grill & Cantina restaurant chain, violated the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

The department alleges that certain servers at the restaurants were “only paid via direct cash and credit tips from customers” and did not receive the federal minimum wage rate of $7.25 per hour.
The chain also is alleged to have “willfully and repeatedly” paid employees less than the statutory overtime rate of 1.5 times the workers’ regular wages for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week.
In addition, the department claims Mexico Lindo paid its “back-of-the-house employees” – a term typically used to describe kitchen workers — a cash salary that was insufficient to compensate them for any overtime hours.
According to the lawsuit, Mexico Lindo then failed to create and preserve accurate records of employees’ hours and failed to document each worker’s full name and Social Security number.
The department alleges defendant Correa-Mata has actively managed and supervised Mexico Lindo’s operations and employees from June 2015 through the present, overseeing the chain’s daily operations, hiring and firing employees, establishing work schedules, and setting rates of pay at each location.
The Department of Labor is seeking a court order enjoining Correa-Mata and the chain from “continuing to withhold employees’ unpaid minimum wages and overtime compensation,” as well as an order finding them liable for any unpaid wages, plus an equal amount in liquidated damages, payable to 25 different employees of the three Mexico Lindo locations.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Correa-Mata at home or at any of the Mexico Lindo restaurants.

This case demonstrates that no matter how long it takes, Oklahoma will hold murderers accountable for their crimes.”
In May, the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted 3-2 to decline clemency.
His attorney, Callie Heller, told the board that Hanson was homeless, developmentally disabled and didn’t get a fair shot at presenting mitigating evidence.
Hanson was imprisoned in Louisiana for an unrelated crime before being transferred in March to Oklahoma so his execution could be carried out.

The plaintiffs, meanwhile, argue the Wyoming Republican Party “went rogue” when it sidelined them. 
The post State GOP asks court to toss disputed Hot Springs leadership election case appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming GOP has asked a Laramie County District Court judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the state party, arguing that the government should not meddle in a private organization’s internal matters. 
The dispute stems from the state party’s recommendation that county GOPs disregard state statute and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling, and allow ousted committee precinct people to vote in local party elections. 
The Hot Springs County Republican Party initially ignored that advice, setting off a series of events that ultimately led to the ousting of two of the plaintiffs from their elected positions. As a result, four Hot Springs County Republican voters filed a complaint in April that accused the state party of interfering in their local GOP elections and asking the court to intervene. 
“Should this court accept plaintiffs’ invitation to commandeer the Wyoming Republican Party’s internal affairs,” the party argued in a May 20 filing, “the court would indeed be injected into an essentially political controversy and would be forced to assume the role of ‘kingmaker…without…clear, objective standards that might insulate from charges of political meddling.’”
The plaintiffs responded in their own filings, arguing that such an intervention is needed to uphold state law and to ensure that they are not prevented from participating in party business, such as voting on nominees in the event of a vacancy in one of Wyoming’s statewide elected offices. In the past few years, the party has selected nominees to fill vacancies for both superintendent of public instruction and secretary of state.
“The relief plaintiffs seek is to compel the state party to continue to comply with statutes that have been on the books for over 50 years and with which the state party in fact complied for over 50 years, until it went rogue,” the filing states. 
How we got here
The plaintiffs include Joe Martinez, Phillip Scheel, Meri Ann Dorman and Clay Van Antwerp, who were elected to chairman, state committeeman, secretary and vice chairman, respectively, at Hot Springs County GOP’s officer elections on March 17. 
After the meeting was adjourned, Cheryl Aguiar, former Hot Springs County GOP chair, filed a complaint with the state party. Aguiar disputed the validity of the county party’s elections since the ousted precinct people were not permitted to vote.

Soon after, the state party’s Dispute Resolution Committee ordered the Hot Springs County GOP to conduct a recount and allow ousted precinct committee people to cast ballots. Consequently, Martinez and Scheel’s victories were overturned. 
Both men attended the Wyoming Republican Party’s meeting in Cody in May, but stood at the sidelines as the party voted in new leadership. 
Necessary parties 
In its motion to dismiss, the state party also argues that by not naming the Hot Springs County GOP as a defendant, the plaintiffs failed to join a necessary party, and that alone is reason to dismiss the case. 
“In fact, plaintiffs’ entire complaint rests upon the foundation that plaintiff’s preferred candidates must be elected members of the Hot Springs Party and acknowledged as the same,” the filing states. 
“For this reason, the court must dismiss this matter unless and until [the] plaintiff joins all necessary parties.”
But even if that’s remedied, the state GOP says it will challenge the constitutionality of state law that regulates county political party elections. 
Response 
State law does not impose “undue burdens” on the party’s internal governance, the plaintiffs argue. 
“The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that states may enact reasonable regulations of political parties, election, and ballots to reduce disorder and ensure the integrity of democratic processes,” the filing states
As with previous filings in the case, the plaintiffs highlighted a 2023 Wyoming Supreme Court decision involving the Uinta County GOP and a party bylaw permitting ousted precinct committee members to vote in officer elections. Ultimately, the high court ruled that the bylaw “violated clear and unambiguous language” in state law. 
In its decision, “the Wyoming Supreme Court recognized the state’s interest in regulating political parties to ensure fair and orderly processes, even though it abstained from ruling on the constitutionality of [the state law],” the filing states. 
The plaintiffs also point to the GOP’s meeting in Cody, where they were sidelined, as a source of irreparable harm. In fact, they argue that the outcome of the race for state GOP vice chair would have turned out differently had Martinez and Scheel been permitted to vote. 
“Plaintiffs, had they been allowed to vote, would have voted for Virginia Bennett, the candidate who lost by one vote to Bob Ferguson,” the filing states, allegedly making Bennett the “rightful winner.” 
“The court should not reward the state party for its bad faith conduct. There is more irreparable harm on the horizon that the state party is ready, willing and able to inflict on the public,” the court document states. 
The case was filed in Laramie County District Court, where the state party is headquartered.

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.


Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.
“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

Harris told the committee on Thursday that a Lee County child suspected of having measles tested negative for the disease. (Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s state health officer said Thursday that a suspected measles case in Lee County turned out to be negative, meaning the state has not yet seen a confirmed case of the disease this year amid measles outbreaks around the nation. 
Dr. Scott Harris Thursday told the State Committee of Public Health, which oversees the Alabama Department of Public Health, that the suspected case was in a child just under 12 months old who was not yet eligible for the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The child had symptoms such as fever and rash, but tested negative on Wednesday.
“At this point, we don’t have our first measles case from this outbreak, that we know of anyway,” Harris said.

ADPH reported Sunday it was investigating a suspected case of measles. In March, the department investigated a possible measles exposure after an unvaccinated child who traveled through the state later tested positive for measles.
Alabama’s MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners was 93.8% in the 2023-2024 school year, under the 95% rate set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to achieve herd immunity.
Harris has said in each board meeting since the outbreaks started this year that a case in Alabama “is coming.” He said there could still be undetected cases, especially in areas with low vaccination rates, that can lead to an outbreak.
“If you have a case that reaches some population, for example, a day care, where kids aren’t old enough to be vaccinated yet. You could expose dozens of children at once,” Harris said after the board meeting.
An outbreak that started with two unvaccinated school-age children in west Texas in January has now spread to at least 33 other states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Since the first outbreak this year, authorities have reported nearly 1,200 cases in people who are either unvaccinated or have unknown status. Of total cases, 12% have been hospitalized and three people have died.
The measles vaccine has significantly reduced severe illness and fatalities since it became available in 1973; previously, measles led to an estimated 48,000 hospitalizations and 400-500 deaths annually in the U.S. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles, and one dose is 93% effective.
Through April, the MMR vaccination rate in Texas was up 450%, compared to its vaccination rate in 2019, according to The Texas Tribune. Since the outbreak, Texas health officials have made the vaccine, which is typically available to children ages one and older, available to infants older than six months. Health officials have also attributed the increased vaccine uptake to public awareness.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC05057.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.

Classic cars in Connecticut become exempt from emissions testing if they are of the model year 2000 or older as of 2025.
In Connecticut, cars that are 20 years or older can be registered as classic vehicles. Under Connecticut General Statutes Section 14-1(3), these are called “antique, rare, or special interest” vehicles if they are preserved due to historical interest and kept in their original, unmodified condition.
These qualifying vehicles are also eligible for a property tax break. According to Connecticut General Statutes Section 12-71(b), their assessed value is capped at $500, which can significantly lower annual property taxes.
Vehicles do become exempt from emissions testing when they are 25 model years old. Until that point, even if a car is registered as a classic, it must still pass emissions testing.
So while tax benefits start at 20 years, emissions exemptions apply only at 25.

Roger Wicker and education board member Mary Werner write.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

The Mississippi Board of Education will soon decide whether to end the U.S. history assessment that our students must pass before receiving a high school diploma.
Today, Mississippi students take four subject matter tests before graduating. Three are federally mandated: algebra, biology, and English. U.S. history is not, so it has landed on the chopping block. Some students would undoubtedly welcome the change, but we believe it would do them a disservice.
One of us is a member of the Board of Education — and the only one to vote in April against this proposal to eliminate the American history test. The other is a concerned citizen and statewide elected official. We both share a deep interest in giving Mississippi’s students everything they need for success in our rapidly changing world.
When our students cross the graduation stage, they reach out to receive their diploma. The hand-off is more than a picture-perfect moment. It is a symbol of one generation bestowing the responsibilities of citizenship onto next. In Mississippi, those duties come quickly. We hold elections every single year. Within one or two cycles, all the graduates will have had a chance to exercise their fundamental right to vote. It would be reassuring to know they are equipped with the civics and history knowledge they will need to choose wisely in the ballot box.
The current U.S. history assessment helps us prepare them for a life of citizenship. Students field questions about historic American political parties and the views these groups espoused. They are quizzed about the effects of landmark legislation and asked to place significant national events in chronological order. By the end, students have demonstrated familiarity with technical political science terms. Graduates walk the stage having handled such topics as tariffs, the Federal Reserve, income tax, and the Monroe Doctrine – each a timely issue.
Members of the Board of Education have been weighing the pros and cons of keeping the test, such as: Each assessment eats into student and staff time. Administering the test is not free. Teachers could use extra time to give students practical career skills. Removing the history exam can make way for workforce training. A U.S. history course will remain a graduation requirement, so eliminating the test frees educators from “teaching to the test.”
We are sympathetic to each of these important considerations. Education is a complicated endeavor, full of trade-offs. But the test has two primary benefits, and they are worth the costs. The first goes to the students, who leave the test room more conversant in American history than many of their fellow citizens. They understand the forces that have shaped our nation, and they can develop informed opinions about political candidates and current events. The second benefit reaches the students who will come next. Every assessment gives us valuable insights by which we can hone curriculum and teaching strategies.
Our state has been making remarkable strides in education, and this progress is equipping the very Mississippians who will lead our state into the 21st century. As they take on our future, we believe they should be as knowledgeable as possible about our past.

A new statewide initiative is aiming to bolster school board leadership across Delaware by equipping newly elected members with free, practical training and support from day one.
First State Educate (FSE), a nonprofit education advocacy organization, officially launched Board First 2025, a no-cost, comprehensive training program tailored for Delaware’s school board members.
The initiative is designed to strengthen governance in public education and improve student outcomes by providing high-quality resources, hands-on tools, and structured guidance.
“Participating in First State Educate’s training has been an incredibly valuable experience,” said said Patty Maull, a newly-elected member of the Cape Henlopen School Board. “I’ve gained important knowledge and insight that has prepared me to confidently begin my journey as a school board member.”
The launch was previewed at a virtual meeting on June 10, where school board members from New Castle, Kent, and Sussex Counties gathered to learn about the program. The strong turnout, organizers said, reflects a widespread desire for better preparation and more effective leadership.
“Our message to districts is simple,” said Julia Keleher, executive director of FSE. “If you want better outcomes for students, start by investing in board development. We’re offering a solution that’s free, actionable, and designed for immediate impact.”
The Board First 2025 program, available through FSE’s online Knowledge Hub, includes:

Self-paced modules on topics like ethics, finance, and governance basics;
Scenario-based learning and printable tools for effective board meetings;
A 90-day guided action plan with self-reflection and goal-setting resources;
Online discussion groups and peer cohorts to promote collaboration statewide.

Until now, Delaware lacked a centralized and evidence-based training program for school boards.
FSE says its offering fills that gap with a curriculum built on national research, including best practices recommended by the National School Boards Association. The program is designed to help boards set clear goals, manage resources responsibly, and improve academic results.
FSE plans to continue offering virtual training sessions and open discussions throughout the 2025–2026 school year.
Participation is open to all Delaware school board members—both new and experienced—regardless of their attendance at the launch event.

Sharice Davids questions USDA secretary Brooke Rollins about why there were terminations at Manhattan's National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Department of Agriculture video)TOPEKA — The firing and rehiring of federal workers at the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan was part of an “imperfect process,” U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said Wednesday.
Rollins responded to questions from U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kansas, at a U.S. House Agriculture Committee hearing. NBAF conducts high-level research of animal pathogens, zoonotic diseases, which are diseases that pass from animals to humans, and other issues that affect food safety.
“It’s the nation’s first bio-safety level 4 lab for livestock. It was built to protect us from the worst animal disease. I understand that 28 employees were fired on a single day, and then later, some of those firings were walked back,” Davids said. “I’m curious. Were the firings a clerical mistake or did someone have second thoughts about the initial decision to fire these specific people?”
Rollins denied there were firings, calling it instead a “probation period” from which all employees were brought back. Davids persisted, asking why any NBAF or food safety employees would be on the “chopping block” in the first place because of the important role they play in protecting the country from severe animal disease.
“It clearly was an imperfect process and one that we moved to rectify within hours if not days,” Rollins said, adding that maintaining a safe food supply is a priority of the administration.
U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, told Rollins the committee is concerned about whether the farm bill will pass and about how Department of Government Efficiency cuts are affecting farmers nationwide.
“I’m genuinely concerned that under this administration, agricultural policymaking has become more partisan and polarized,” Craig said. “This reckless push to cut nearly $300 billion in funding to a title of the farm bill, instead of prioritizing getting a 12-title, five-year farm bill across the finish line is of particular concern of this committee, and it has put the bipartisan farm bill in jeopardy.”
Craig listed high input costs, bird flu concerns, food bank defunding, tariffs causing global markets to be lost, removal of ability for schools to buy local farm products, and more, as issues.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s lawsuit over President Trump’s deployment of the Marines and National Guard to Los Angeles could influence how future presidents respond to domestic unrest.


A federal judge halted President Trump’s deployment of California National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles, finding that Trump broke the law in ordering them to put down urban unrest without consulting Gov. Gavin Newsom.The judge, Charles Breyer, wrote that Trump’s “actions were illegal — both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”The ruling is scheduled to take effect on Friday at noon and last until June 20. Breyer did not intervene to stop the president from calling in the U.S. Marines — at least for now.
The Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Lawyers representing the Newsom administration sought an immediate order to prevent the troops from performing law-enforcement duties and to instead limit their role to protecting federal property.
Judge Breyer’s ruling came mere hours after he held a hearing on the case, where he seemed to take a dim view of the administration’s argument that presidents have broad, unreviewable authority to commandeer state National Guard personnel.
“The president is of course limited to his authority,” Breyer said during the Thursday hearing. “That’s the difference between a constitutional government and King George.”
He doubled down on that point in his order, writing that “the Court is not convinced that the judiciary cannot question presidential assertions about domestic activities leading to military action.”
Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent the National Guard into L.A. last weekend and readied the Marines to do the same, over the objections of Newsom and elected officials in Los Angeles. 
It remains unclear how the White House or Department of Defense will respond to the hearing. Earlier today Hegseth refused to say whether he would follow the courts if they ruled against the deployment of active-duty Marines to Los Angeles during a congressional hearing Thursday.
Breyer seemed to have that in mind when he stressed to the administration’s lawyers that parties in a lawsuit are obligated to follow court orders. 
“That’s right, isn’t it?” he said. 
The federal attorney representing Trump nodded to the judge.
“The federal government is agreeing with me on this issue,” Breyer said.
Throughout the proceedings, which ranged from heady constitutional analysis to a deep semantic debate over the word “through,” Breyer seemed unconvinced by the federal government’s key arguments: That the president did not need to consult Newsom before seizing control of the National Guard and that judges have no power to second-guess his decision to do so. 
“How is that any different from what a monarchist does?” Breyer said when discussing those arguments.
Breyer’s order is part of several legal steps moving on parallel tracks: the decision to temporarily block Trump’s takeover of the Guard and then the wider issue of whether that was legal. Both matters can move through the courts. Because the judge ordered a temporary halt to Trump’s control of California’s National Guard, Trump’s lawyers appealed that move. But Breyer hasn’t ruled on the broader legal issues of the case. And once he does, either Newsom or Trump will likely appeal his ruling.
In his order, Breyer wrote that Trump’s White House “did not notify Governor Newsom of their intent to federalize the California National Guard,” ultimately supporting Newsom’s contention that Trump never gave him a heads up.
In calling in the troops, the administration argued that the armed forces will do what local law enforcement has so far been unable to do: Bring order to the streets of L.A. Critics, including Newsom, counter that sending soldiers — especially Marines trained for the battlefield — to quell a civil disturbance is just as likely to inflame the situation and ratchet up the risk of violence. 
Trump ordered the National Guard to Los Angeles on Saturday after protests broke out in response to federal immigration officers raiding work sites and arresting individuals they say are in the country without authorization. Trump’s order cited “incidents of violence and disorder” in his message. The soldiers will “temporarily protect” the immigration enforcement officers, the memo said.The president has so far ordered 4,000 National Guard and 700 U.S. Marine troops to L.A. Breyer, who was appointed to the bench by President Bill Clinton, seemed unwilling to weigh in on the question of the Marines, if only because they have yet to arrive in Los Angeles.
Trump has not yet invoked the Insurrection Act, a law that would give him more authority to deploy troops domestically and use them for law enforcement. As is, the National Guard soldiers are charged with protecting federal agents and buildings. 
But that didn’t stop Breyer from observing that Trump’s own social media posts sought a wider role for troops. He noted that Trump reportedly wrote online that he had directed his cabinet officials to “liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion” and that “we’re going to have troops everywhere.”
The judge wrote that “certainly differs from the circumscribed role professed in the opposition brief.”
After the ruling came down, Attorney General Rob Bonta said, “The truth is, the president is looking for any pretense to place military forces on American streets to intimidate and quiet, those who disagree with him. It’s not just immoral. It’s dangerous. And it’s illegal.”
Core to Trump’s justification was a federal statute that only one president had previously used, Bonta’s legal team wrote. President Richard Nixon employed it so that the National Guard could deliver the mail during the U.S. Postal Service strike of 1970. It’s also the first time since 1965 that a president federalized a state National Guard without the request of a governor.Newsom and Bonta sued Monday after the governor formally asked Trump to rescind his activation of the Guard. They filed the suit just as news outlets began reporting that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth would deploy the U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, as well. On Tuesday Newsom and Bonta sought a temporary restraining order to halt both deployments.
Generals side with Newsom
The California challenges argued that involving the Marines and National Guard harms state sovereignty, drains California’s resources and “escalates tensions and promotes (rather than quells) civil unrest.”
That argument earned the endorsement of two former service secretaries and six retired four-star admirals and generals on Wednesday night. In a court filing, the former leaders, who have collectively served each president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama, argued that because Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act or clearly define the role of the troops, the deployment “poses multiple risks to the core mission of the National Guard and the Marines, and to the well-being of the troops.” They add that the deployment risks “inappropriately politicizing the military.”
Newsom’s suit says the city does not need the military to keep the peace. “To put it bluntly, there is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles; there is civil unrest that is no different from episodes that regularly occur in communities throughout the country, and that is capable of being contained by state and local authorities working together,” the suit said.
Judge Breyer agreed that the pockets of unrest during the protests didn’t rise to the level of “rebellion” that would warrant Trump’s calling in the National Guard, writing that “violence is necessary for a rebellion, but it is not sufficient.”Breyer added: “Nor is there evidence that any of the violent protesters were attempting to overthrow the government as a whole”
Lawsuit tests executive power
Newsom also maintains that a president cannot deploy the National Guard without approval from the state governor. Newsom and Bonta cite the government code that permits Trump to deploy the National Guard, which says federalizing the troops is “issued through” the governor.
The Trump legal team offers the opposite interpretation of the government code: “The statute is thus clear that the orders are issued by the President, and they are conveyed through State officials. Nothing in the statute entitles a Governor to veto or impede a valid presidential order,” the team wrote in their filing on Wednesday.
Breyer seemed to look upon that argument with deep skepticism.
“I’m trying to figure out how something is ‘through’ somebody if in fact you didn’t give it to them,” he said to federal attorney Brett Shumate.Shumate had argued that “the governor is merely a conduit, He’s not a roadblock, the President doesn’t have to call up the governor.”The judge also shot down Shumate’s argument that Trump properly briefed Newsom on his plans to federalize the National Guard, saying that without a clear record of what Trump told Newsom, there’s no evidence that Newsom was briefed.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825-Natl-Guard-MDC-DTLA-TS-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503
,Mississippi Today,2025-06-12 14:04:53+00:00,Mississippi Today,Marcus Taylor should have been freed years ago. Mississippi courts refuse to release him,Lili Euzet,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/12/marcus-taylor-should-have-been-freed-years-ago-mississippi-courts-refuse-to-release-him/,Marcus Taylor has spent five years longer in prison than he should have on a drug offense and may spend another five.,"Marcus Taylor has been incarcerated for 10 years, serving a sentence that should have ended five years ago. 
In 2015, a judge sentenced the husband and father to 15 years in prison for conspiring to sell an opioid combination pain-relief medication – a schedule III controlled substance. But he spent eight years in jail before anyone realized the maximum sentence for his crime by law was five years. In May, the Mississippi Court of Appeals recognized that Taylor was serving a sentence 10 years longer than the legal maximum, but refused to order his release despite making note of the mistake, arguing that the issue was raised too late.
Taylor, now 43, was indicted in 2014 on two counts of conspiracy to sell controlled substances, and one count of business burglary for breaking and entering a drugstore to steal them. In February 2015, he took what he thought was an advantageous deal: he pleaded guilty to the first count, and the two others were dismissed. But the plea petition was riddled with mistakes. It erroneously said the maximum sentence for conspiracy to sell schedule III controlled substances was 20 years – not five years.  And no one in the court, including his lawyer, realized his sentence was 10 years longer than the legal maximum.
It’s only after he challenged his sentence in 2023, demanding eligibility for parole, that the problem surfaced. The Choctaw County Circuit Court denied Taylor’s motion for post-conviction relief, because he filed it past the three-year deadline of his conviction. 
After investigating the issue for over a year, the appellate court ruled on May 6 this year that Taylor was indeed serving a sentence 10 years longer than authorized by law – meaning he should have been released in 2020. Yet, in a five-five decision, the court of appeals decided Taylor should still serve the rest of his wrongful sentence – because he didn’t file his request in time.
The court invoked a 2023 ruling by the Mississippi Supreme Court in Howell v. State of Mississippi, which put an end to the fundamental rights exception – an exemption to the three-year time limit to file a post-conviction relief claim, made to ensure individuals don’t stay unconstitutionally incarcerated.
The Mississippi Court of Appeals is obligated to follow the Supreme Court precedent, said Matthew Steffey, professor at the Mississippi College School of Law.
“This is the expected outcome of Howell, that there are going to be meritorious claims that are shut down for these technical limits,” he said. “That’s why many people, including dissenters on the Court of Appeals, believe it’s wrong.”
Indeed, despite this Supreme Court ruling, half the judges were ready to grant Taylor relief.
“All Mississippians have the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and to incarcerate Taylor beyond the time authorized by law infringes upon that fundamental right,” Judge David Neil McCarty wrote in a dissenting opinion. 
But if the result is tied in a Court of Appeals, common practice calls for the court to confirm the original decision, Steffey said.
On June 2, Taylor filed a motion for rehearing, asking the Court of Appeals to reconsider its application of Howell, saying his incarceration is a deprivation of his constitutional rights. But the Court of Appeals could still refuse to rehear the case.
In case of an unfavorable ruling, Taylor’s lawyer, Damon Stevenson, said they were ready to take the case to the Mississippi Supreme Court. If it agrees to examine Taylor’s case, the Supreme Court could clarify how the law should be applied in cases like Taylor’s.
“I do think one has to reinterpret Mississippi Supreme Court precedent to give Mr. Taylor relief, and that’s more a job for the Supreme Court than the court of appeals,” Steffey said. 
Many hope Taylor’s case and potential release could set a precedent and protect others in the same situation. Mississippi courts have refused to grant relief to incarcerated people serving expired sentences in the past, even before Howell. 
“We could get a clear law in the state of Mississippi that says there are certain rights that are not abridged by time: at any point that injustice is recognized, the court can step in and right it,” Stevenson said.
The escalation of the case has led the Capital Post-Conviction Counsel to step in. On June 4, it filed an amicus brief – additional information and legal arguments given to the court to assist them in their decision, in support of Taylor’s motion for rehearing. Although the state office normally assists individuals sentenced to death in Mississippi, it has expertise in helping people file post-conviction petitions, just like Taylor.
The attorney general’s office, which represents the state of Mississippi in the case, rapidly opposed the counsel’s intervention, demanding that the Court reject its brief. The AG’s office argued that the Capital Post-Conviction Counsel’s involvement was “neither necessary nor appropriate,” and that it had filed the brief too late.
To Stevenson, the attorney general’s office’s immediate opposition shows a broader pattern of combativeness against defendants, at the expense of fairness and justice.
“At this point, it’s our position that Mr. Taylor has actually moved from being a defendant to a victim,” Stevenson said. “The attorney general’s office has to take an honest look at this case and say, ‘Do we really want to be on the side of fighting for people to stay incarcerated who legally do not belong in a prison cell?’”
Defendants’ rights are often overlooked although they are an essential part of a fair judicial process, because severity sells electorally, and ultimately, judges are elected public officials, Steffey said.
“Judges campaign promising to be fair, or to be tough and fair, or to be tough, all of which sends a signal that they are part of the crime fighting community,” Steffey said. “You hear a lot about justice for victims, very little about justice for the accused.”
While the Court of Appeals still hasn’t decided whether to rehear Taylor’s case or not, his children are growing up without him. And his wife, Kimberly Brown Taylor, is raising them alone.
When she started dating Taylor in 2008, Brown Taylor already had a baby, Joshua, who is 19 now. Taylor treated him like his own, she said. They still write each other letters. With Taylor, she had another son, Blakeland, who is 13 and has not seen his father since he got incarcerated when he was just a baby. 
“It has been kind of hard on me as a single parent,” Brown Taylor said. “ I haven’t slept at night at all since he’s been gone.” 
When Taylor was incarcerated, Brown Taylor found herself having to assume the financial and personal charge of raising two kids. She went back to college and studied accounting. She worked two jobs until she became an accountant. Just like everyone else, she had no idea his sentence was above the legal maximum. She’s angry about the time lost and worried about Taylor’s mental health. 
“For someone to sit in there past that time, I guess the extra five years, that can mess with someone mentally,” she said. “He could have been there, being that father to my son, giving me relief, giving my son the loving that he needed.”
Brown Taylor says she keeps Blakeland and Joshua informed about their dad’s case everyday, but they still don’t understand why he can’t come home. Blakeland feels like a part of his childhood was stripped away. He said he wishes his father could watch his basketball games and participate in school father-son events with him. 
“I just feel like my dad should be at home. It’s eating me alive,” Blakeland said.
Taylor might very well serve the five remaining years of his original sentence, if the Court of Appeals or the Mississippi Supreme Court don’t rule in his favor. His lawyer argues he has far served his time, and should be brought back into the community.
“When people make mistakes, it is totally acceptable to ask them to pay their debt to society,” Stevenson said. “However, their debt should not be greater than what is allowed by law.”
Time passes and incomprehension grows in the Taylor family. It gets a little harder everyday to understand why Taylor remains incarcerated. 
“God gives all of us chances after chances after chances. So why can’t they or whomever allow Marcus to have a chance?” Brown Taylor said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/10095411/RenderedImage.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Kurtis Gregory warned about the potential hit to jobs and tax revenues if the state were to lose a team.
But during Missouri Senate debate last week, he acknowledged that pride was also a prime motivator in his efforts to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals, both of which are being courted to move several miles away into neighboring Kansas.
A former University of Missouri football player, Gregory pointed to the Missouri-Kansas rivalry that dates back to the Civil War and characterized Kansas as “kind of an archrival.”
“We just let the state of Kansas poach, you know, really the pride and joy of the western side of the state, and I would say the entire state of Missouri?” he said in his floor speech. “And then I would also say, what’s next? What’s the next thing the state of Kansas is going to try and take from us?”
Missouri special session ends with passage of KC stadium funding, disaster aid

Days after the 2025 legislative session ended in May, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session for lawmakers to consider stadium funding and disaster relief bills. Last week, the state Senate approved Gregory’s stadium incentives bill in the middle of the night by a 19-13 vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the state House approved the measure by a 90-58 vote, sending it to the governor’s desk.
The bill would fund up to 50% of construction or renovation costs and is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion over 30 years, the Missouri Independent reported.
Stateline was unable to reach Gregory for comment.
Economists have panned the ongoing stadium bidding war between Missouri and Kansas — which has offered to pay up to 70% of new stadium costs — as a waste of taxpayer dollars. But Gregory’s comments highlight the emotional undercurrents frequently at play in sports stadium funding debates across the country.
Experts nearly unanimously agree that public subsidies for stadiums are a poor investment, but that hasn’t slowed a wave of local and state spending for billionaire team owners.
Washington, D.C., could spend more than $1 billion to move the Washington Commanders some seven miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site, described by the team’s controlling owner as the “spiritual home” of the NFL franchise.
Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who studies stadium deals, said these kinds of arguments ignore the economic reality of stadium subsidies.
“You’re not talking economics. You’re talking pure emotion,” he said.
Despite mounds of evidence showing the public does not fare well on stadium investments, he said lawmakers and mayors still tout the potential for jobs and new tax revenues with stadiums and arenas.
Oftentimes, teams and politicians stir fears about the possibility of losing franchises to another market to increase pressure, he said. But three of the most prominent stadium subsidy deals under consideration now — in Chicago, Kansas City and the district — involve teams looking to move within the same metro area.
“I would appreciate it if lawmakers were that transparent, and they’re like, ‘I don’t care how much this costs, there’s no price that’s too high for us to pay to keep them here,’” Propheter said.
 ‘Generations to get past’

But cities and states have more at stake than raw economics, said Irwin Kishner, a New York attorney who has represented pro teams in multiple stadium deals.
He likened the stadium debate to those surrounding the Olympics: Research has found that host cities generally spend well in excess of the revenue generated by the games. But cities and nations still fiercely compete for the chance to host the high-profile event.
“It elevates the status of venues,” Kishner said. “And I think it’s very much the same thing with stadiums and arenas.”
He said cities also face potential economic consequences of lost jobs and tax revenues if teams leave altogether.
Oakland, California, for example, lost both its pro football and baseball teams to Nevada after local stadium talks fell apart. The NFL’s Raiders now play in Las Vegas and MLB’s A’s are playing temporarily in West Sacramento, California, before moving into their under-construction stadium on the Vegas strip.
“What happened in Oakland is a classic example of what happens when a team doesn’t get their building in the way they want it,” Kishner said.
And those sorts of relocations can leave lasting marks, he said, pointing to the sour feelings that still persist in Brooklyn decades after MLB’s Dodgers left for Los Angeles. Other cities have similarly iconic teams, such as the NFL’s Chicago Bears.
“When push comes to shove, municipalities would be embarrassed to lose a team. I mean, could you imagine the Bears playing in St. Louis as an argument?” Kishner said. “I think Chicago would have something to say about that in a very emotional way. And by the way, these things take generations to get past.”
Currently, Chicago’s stadium discussions are more localized.
After first sharing plans to build a new stadium along Lake Michigan’s shore in Chicago, the Bears are now pursuing a massive football stadium development in suburban Arlington Heights. Despite introducing various tax measures aimed to benefit megaprojects such as stadiums, Illinois lawmakers ended their session on May 31 with no action on the matter.
Illinois state Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side, said lawmakers have little appetite to invest heavily in stadiums.
The MLS’ Chicago Fire just announced plans to privately finance a new $650 million professional soccer stadium in the city’s South Loop — the same area the MLB’s White Sox are also eyeing as they explore a new baseball stadium.
“The days of widespread public money for private stadiums without public benefit — those days are over, and that is not just a sentiment in the state of Illinois. I think this is a sentiment across the country,” Buckner said.
Still, he acknowledged the sway emotions can have in the matter. While the Bears leaving the city limits likely would not affect the region’s economy, he said, it would still prove a blow to morale.
“My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal,” he said, “but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.”
 Money matters

Missouri’s stadium debate has been simmering for years now: The Royals first announced plans in 2022 to move downtown from their stadium on the outskirts of the city. And the Chiefs — who share the sprawling stadium complex with the Royals — quickly followed with talks of wanting a new or renovated stadium.
After voters in a county election last year soundly rejected extending a stadium sales tax to fund those plans, lawmakers across the border in Kansas passed legislation that would fund up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That measure expires at the end of June, pushing Missouri legislators to act.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said such deadlines are arbitrary and meant to exact political pressure.
While politicians once had plausible deniability about the pitfalls of stadium subsidies, the research is now overwhelmingly clear and well covered in the media, he said. It’s been nearly a decade since HBO’s John Oliver dedicated an episode of his satirical news show to the folly of stadium finance.
Deal to pay for Chiefs, Royals stadiums fractures Missouri Freedom Caucus

But politicians on both sides of the aisle continue to push stadium subsidies — whether they’re touting the potential for wider real estate development or intangibles such as team pride and fears of losing franchises.
“It’s this prescribed dance, where everybody sort of pretends to be doing due diligence, but at the same time, everybody knows it’s going to happen,” deMause said.
He said that appears to be the case in the nation’s capital.
In April, city and team officials for the Washington Commanders announced plans for a 65,000-seat stadium. The proposed deal, which must be approved by the full city council, would cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over eight years.
But deMause’s analysis of the plan determined the public will be spending well in excess of that figure because of billions in free rent and hundreds of millions in property tax breaks. He estimates taxpayers will pay or forgo at least $7.5 billion on the deal.
“Everybody in and around the D.C. Council seems to be saying, ‘Yeah, it sure is a lot of money, but the mayor really wants it, so it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can improve it some,’” he said. “It’s a little bit like saying, ‘World War II is going to happen — just try and keep the death toll down.’”
Last week, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report it commissioned that projected the stadium would create billions in new economic output and local tax revenue in the coming decades — figures that were quickly disputed by skeptical economists and academics.
Still, much of the district’s stadium conversation has centered on intangibles such as hometown pride and nostalgia. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell waxed about his childhood memories attending games at the old RFK Stadium at an April event announcing the deal.
Sitting in front of a “WELCOME HOME” banner at that event, the mayor said the RFK site was “where they belong.”
“I want to start by saying welcome home,” she said.

This was the case when Eras Tour tickets went on sale in November of 2022, which fans refer to as The Great War, where glitches and online bots prevented many fans from being able to purchase a ticket for the tour off of Ticketmaster.

The bipartisan bills, House Bills 4262 and 4263 and Senate Bills 158 and 159, would prohibit individuals from creating or utilizing a bot that can circumvent ticket purchasing limits, hop the line in online queues or otherwise defrauding the online ticket buying experience through software or bot programs.

On the House side, which cleared its bills out of committee with bipartisan support earlier this month, one of the sponsors, Rep. Mike Harris (R-Waterford Township) told lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee that bad actors are exploiting the system and preventing people and their families from experiencing sporting events and concerts important to them.
“As a father of six, yes, I have attended a Taylor Swift concert. That was my duty as a father of four girls,” Harris said during committee. “I believe these are meaningful safeguards that will increase transparency and ensure a much fairer purchasing process for people here in Michigan.”
The House bills cleared the committee unanimously.
On the Senate side, Wednesday, the bills cleared the Finance, Insurance, and Consumer Protection Committee nearly unanimously, except for one pass by Sen. Lana Theis (R-Brighton) on Senate Bill 159, which like House Bill 4262, would place a $5,000 civil fine on each violation to the Event Online Ticket Sales Act and allow the Michigan Attorney General’s Office to bring civil action against violators.

A Newark woman has been arrested and charged with filing a false report after allegedly fabricating the kidnapping of her 3-year-old daughter, Nola Dinkins, which prompted an Amber Alert and multi-agency overnight search.
On Tuesday evening, police responded to the 500 block of Gender Road after 31-year-old Darrian Randle reported that Nola had been abducted at gunpoint by an unknown white male. According to Randle, the man approached her vehicle with a handgun and took the child, fleeing in a dark-colored SUV driven by a white female.

That account led authorities to issue an Amber Alert and launch an intensive investigation involving the New Castle County Police Criminal Investigations Unit and the FBI. But detectives later determined that Randle’s story was false.
The Amber Alert was canceled Wednesday, and the case has now been turned over to the Maryland State Police as a homicide investigation.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
A small town tries to revive its hospital in the middle of a rural health crisis

Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.

Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.










You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services. 


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform


“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

A recent online petition has garnered nearly 300 signatures, with people adding comments about the positive impact of a skate park for residents and visitors.

As Killington celebrates the 50th anniversary of its recreation center, some residents are pushing to make a skate park a new permanent fixture of the town’s summer offerings. 
The town crafted its recreation master plan to holistically determine how to best use its resources to serve residents in the future, Recreation Department Director Emily Hudson said.  
The department’s first priority in the next three to five years is to upgrade the outdated pool house and replace the public pool, which has a “small, slow leak” the town has dealt with for years, Hudson said. 
“We’ve had some issues with the pool,” Hudson said. Those issues “fueled this whole master plan project to start to look at what amenities we need to meet the needs of current programming and what would community members like to see.”
The proposal also included a long-term plan to build a multiuse field house for indoor tennis, pickleball, soccer and basketball, and maintenance. 
But Tucker Zink, general manager for Darkside Snowboards shop, said he noticed a gap in the project: a skate park. 
Killington could follow the lead of more populated towns, like Burlington and Waterbury, that have built shake parks in the last decade, Zink said. The town, with vast mountainous terrain, is known as a hub for skiers and snowboarding in winter, and biking, riding, hiking and skateboarding in the summer months, he said. 
“The people that are here are here to recreate outdoors,” Zink said. “Skateboarding goes hand in hand with all that.”
The Darkside Snowboards shop has a mini ramp and other regularly used skateboarding features on the property, but “a true concrete facility is worlds beyond what we have here,” he said. 
Zink created an online petition Monday night to raise awareness during the public comment period on the master plan in hopes that the recreation department would see a skate park as a priority for the Killington community.
In the three days since posting, the petition has garnered nearly 300 signatures, with more than 100 people adding comments about the positive impact of a skate park for residents and visitors.
“What I’m doing is just trying to stir up support, to get it on their radar so that, as they revise their plans and move forward with a more finalized plan, they’ll include a skate park in it,” Zink said. 
Zink said the closest skate parks to Killington are in Manchester, Ludlow and Bethel, as the Flipside skate park in Rutland shut down in 2020. The long distance to the facilities creates barriers for locals interested in skateboarding, especially for younger generations, he said. 
While a popular ski and snowboard destination during the winter, Killington’s year-round population has rested at approximately 1,400 people since 2020. During the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an influx of people moving to the town, including families with children that needed more opportunities for outdoor activities, Zink said. 
Seeing the need for skateboarding opportunities in the community, Zink said Darkside Snowboards has offered a summer skateboarding camp every summer since 2017, and participation has grown steadily over time. 
“It’s obvious that people want this type of programming,” Zink said. “It’s suddenly something people want to do. It’s just a matter of having a place to do it.”
Hudson said the Recreation Department began crafting the master plan last fall in collaboration with a consultant, town planners and the Recreation and Planning Commission, and presented it to the public on April 1. 
After little public feedback since April, Hudson said she got the petition this week along with a dozen emails from residents requesting a skate park and a pump track for scooters and bike motocross riders.
The current iteration of the plan is a “placeholder” that can change with public input, and the department plans to share the skate park feedback with the consultant, Hudson said.
Hudson said the town is welcoming ideas during the public comment period, but that it will likely take a decade or more to fund and install new facilities besides the pool and pool house. She said the department does not want recreation facilities to create “an additional burden” on the town’s taxpayers. 
Zink said facilities for soccer or baseball require long-term planning for upkeep and programming, but a skate park will offer ongoing opportunities for residents while not placing a heavy burden on the town.  
“One good thing about a skate park is that once it’s built, it doesn’t take much maintenance, and anyone can just show up and do it on their own,” he said. “It’s something that’s beneficial to pretty much everybody.”

Rep. RJ May, a founding member of the state’s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, faces 10 counts of distributing child sexual abuse material, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. May pleaded not guilty in court Thursday.
May was arrested Wednesday outside his West Columbia home and booked in the Lexington County jail, according to jail records that quickly disappeared from public view.

May was suspended without pay from the House on Thursday pending the case’s outcome, according to a letter from the House Speaker’s Office. State law requires an officeholder indicted on a felony to be suspended.
Speaker Murrell Smith, R-Sumter, declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation.
May, who arrived in court Thursday wearing a white T-shirt and gray athletic shorts, also faces up to 20 years in prison, with a minimum of five years, as well as a fine of up to $250,000 if found guilty. If May is convicted, prosecutors will seek a sentence at or near the maximum, U.S. Assistant Attorney Scott Matthews told Judge Shiva Hodges Thursday.
In April 2024, social messaging app Kik notified the nonprofit National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of videos involving child sexual abuse sent from an account called “joebidennnn69.” Investigators tracked the account to May’s house and cellphone, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
The “joebidennnn69” account was established March 30, 2024, and deleted five days later, said Britton Lorenzen, a special agent for the Department of Homeland Security’s division investigating internet crimes against children. In that time, the account sent more than 1,100 messages, mostly explicit in nature. Investigators identified 220 different videos and images depicting child sexual abuse saved to it, she testified in court.
Most of the videos involved young children, including toddlers and infants, Lorenzen said. Some depicted violent acts, and at least one included beastiality, she said.
To prove the phone belonged to May, prosecutors presented phone records that showed May made calls to his wife or clients at his consulting firm, researched legislation and, in one case, texted a friend “happy Easter” at the same time the videos were being sent over Kik.
Dayne Phillips, who represented May during the investigation and in court Thursday, argued the overlap in phone records showed May couldn’t have been the one sending the videos. The judge disagreed, pointing out that she had been texting a law clerk and rescheduling hearings on her phone while taking notes during May’s hearing.
“I don’t think it a big leap that one uses a phone for multiple reasons at the same time,” Hodges said.
Phillips also argued someone may have taken control of May’s phone or gotten onto his home internet during those five days, alluding to unnamed “political enemies” who may have wanted to harm May’s career or reputation.
May’s home WiFi and phone were both password protected, meaning it would be difficult for another person to access them, said Matthews.
Federal investigators seized electronics from 38-year-old May last August. Two months later, a court filing confirmed they took a Lenovo laptop, an Amazon tablet, four cellphones, four hard drives, four SD cards, two DVD-Rs and 19 thumb drives.
Among those were two cellphones found in May’s master bedroom, one belonging to him and the other belonging to his wife. The phone belonging to May’s wife was not linked to child sexual abuse material, Lorenzen said.
While none of the devices investigators seized had child sexual abuse material saved directly on them, that’s not uncommon, Lorenzen testified, considering the ability to save media to the cloud through various apps.
May’s phone showed several apps had recently been deleted, including Kik and other encrypted, foreign-based apps for which U.S. investigators can’t get search warrants, Lorenzen said. But data on the phone that saves commonly used phrases suggested the “joebidennnn69” username, as well as an alternate email account linked to that Kik user, had been typed repeatedly, she said.
On May’s personal laptop, investigators also found nine separate videos of May paying to have sex with women who appeared to be young. The videos appear to have been recorded during international trips May took to Colombia in 2023 and 2024, Lorenzen said. Investigators have not been able to identify the women or determine their ages, she said.
May doesn’t face any charges related to those videos. However, Hodges referenced the videos as a reason to keep May in jail until the date of his trial. She said the videos suggest May has ties to another country, making him a potential flight risk.
Hodges also worried that many of the children in the videos appeared to be about the same age as May’s two children, both of whom are under 10 years old, she said.
“I am concerned about the danger to the community, specifically to May’s two minor children, as well as other children, who are somebody’s children,” Hodges said.
Members of the Freedom Caucus, which suspended May’s membership last year, called for him to resign his House seat.
May previously served as vice chairman but no longer held a leadership position after the caucus’ officer elections last July. His connections in Congress helped launch the state Freedom Caucus in 2022. He acted as de facto spokesman for the group as it battled with the main Republican Caucus until the federal investigation became public.
“These crimes are heinous and we expect that they will be fully investigated,” the Freedom Caucus statement read.

May has not been involved with Freedom Caucus activities since last August, said Rep. Jordan Pace, R-Goose Creek, the caucus’ current chairman. May attended this year’s session, but he stayed quiet, not getting involved in floor debates and continuing to vote alongside the Freedom Caucus.
The last legislator suspended while facing charges was Rep. Rick Martin in 2021. The Newberry Republican was charged with giving alcohol to a 15-year-old girl and trying to influence an investigation by the state Department of Social Services, which the former foster parent denied at the time.
Martin lost a bid for reelection the following year, losing the primary election to Freedom Caucus member Rep. Joe White. His case is ongoing.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Developers of the Donlin Gold mine in Western Alaska must pause some of its construction while government agencies correct deficiencies that led to flawed permits for the controversial project, a federal judge has ruled.
U.S. District Court Juge Sharon Gleason on Monday ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Bureau of Land Management to analyze the possibility of a catastrophic dam failure and, if necessary, withdraw or modify the permits they already issued to Donlin Gold LLC, the project’s developer.
The order stems from a lawsuit filed by six Kuskokwim region tribal governments that oppose the project, which would be one of the world’s biggest gold mines. The plaintiffs have cited, in particular, concerns about the mine’s plan for a 471-foot dam to contain tailings, the term for ground waste rock produced in the mining process.
Tailings can hold concentrations of chemicals like mercury and cyanide that degrade aquatic ecosystems. Tailings spills can occur when mine dams are breached, as happened in 2014 at the Mount Polley copper and gold mine in British Columbia. That dam failure released about 8 million cubic meters of tailings and other waste material.
Gleason’s ruling on Monday was a follow-up to a ruling she issued in September.
Then, the judge ruled that the Corps and BLM erred by neglecting to consider the risks of a large or catastrophic dam failure. The 2018 environmental impact statement that led to the permits being issued that year identified a 2% chance of such a dam failure over a 20-year period; the Donlin mine, if built, is projected to operate for more than 25 years. The agencies, however, did not consider any spill of over 0.5% of the millions of tons contained by the planned dam, a spill that would be far smaller than the size that should have been considered, Gleason said in that ruling.
In her new ruling on Monday, Gleason ordered the agencies to add “analysis of a larger tailings spill” to their previous environmental studies. Before Donlin Gold may undertake any construction work covered by the Corps or BLM permits, the company must issue a 90-day notice, Gleason said.
That required notice would give the plaintiffs time to raise legal objections that might be grounds for further halts to work, said Maile Tavepholjalern, the Earthjustice attorney who is representing the tribal plaintiffs.
Both mine opponents and Donlin Gold, the company trying to build the mine, described Gleason’s ruling as a victory.
“Not all tribes who oppose the Donlin Gold mine are involved in these lawsuits, but most tribes in our region have concerns about the safety of the mine and potential harm to the region,” Gavin Phillip, tribal administrator for Native Village of Kwigillingok, said in a statement. “We hope this court ruling will help ensure that our lands, waters and communities remain protected. This mine does not have social license to operate, and does not reflect our tribe’s priorities, which are hunting, fishing and stewarding these lands and waters as we always have.”
Donlin Gold, meanwhile, pointed out in a statement that Gleason rejected the plaintiffs’ request to overturn the permits and instead allowed them to remain in place while the deficiencies are corrected.
“The Court’s order reiterates that the issue on remand is narrow and we look forward to working with the federal agencies to address the issue,” Todd Dahlman, general manager of Donlin Gold, said in the statement. “As it has been throughout the permitting process, Donlin Gold remains committed to working collaboratively with permitting agencies and stakeholders to advance the responsible development of the project,” which he noted is located on Alaska Native lands.
In her ruling, Gleason said the problem with the environmental impact statement was the failure “to adequately consider one aspect of a complex mining project.” The Corps and BLM have already considered the possibility of a tailings spill, “albeit only a spill of 0.5% of the total tailings volume,” she said in her ruling.
While Gleason declined to overturn the permits, as the plaintiffs has requested, she also declined to set an 18-month deadline for supplemental environmental analysis that Donlin Gold has requested.
The Corps, in a statement late Tuesday, said it will adhere to the court ruling and complete a supplemental analysis of a larger potential dam spill and follow that with action to “modify, reaffirm, or rescind” the previous authorizations.
The Donlin plan has divided the region’s mostly Yup’ik residents.
The mine site is on Native-owned terrirory, and for-profit corporations created by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act stand to be economic beneficiaries if it is developed.
The Kuskokwim Corp., a Native village corporation, owns the surface rights, and Calista Corp., the larger corporation owned by Indigenous people of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, owns the mineral rights.
Numerous tribal governments and organizations, meanwhile, oppose the mine, citing what they say are unacceptable risks of damage to the river habitat that supports fishing and other food-gathering and cultural practices.
The mine’s developer, Donlin Gold LLC, is a partnership owned by Vancouver-based Novagold Resources Inc. and John Paulson, a billionaire investor. Paulson entered the Donlin Gold partnership by buying out shares held by Barrick Resources, a major international mining company that announced in April that it is dropping the project.
Barrick, with operations in 18 countries, was less interested in Donlin than in some of its other opportunities, its chairman said when the sale to Paulson was announced.

“I had a pretty immediate, almost visceral ‘no’ inside of me to the thought of mixing psychedelics with therapy,” said Schroeder, who has had a private practice in St. Louis since 2011.
But that resistant reaction also sparked her curiosity. 
“I began reading clinical research and listening to interviews with pioneers in the field,” she said. 
As a provider who specializes in helping people work through trauma, she uses a variety of methods, including somatic and experiential healing and inner child work. 
“I was very, very intrigued, and that kind of was the biggest part of me wanting to move forward in the psychedelics.”
Earlier this month, Schroeder’s practice, Transformation Counseling, announced the addition of psychedelic-assisted therapy services in Oregon and Colorado — the only states where psilocybin services are legally sanctioned.
She is a certified psychedelic-assisted therapist and licensed psilocybin facilitator in Oregon and Colorado, where she completed her training. About half of her clients travel in from out of state for the therapy, she said, including a large number from Missouri. 
Schroeder has followed the studies by psychiatry researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, showing potential benefits of psychedelics in addressing hard-to-treat psychiatric problems. 
She’s been excited to hear about Missouri lawmakers pushing legislation for the last three years to require the state to conduct a study on using psilocybin to treat depression, substance use or as part end-of-life care. Though the bill died once again this year during the legislative session that ended in May, it was the first time it won the Senate’s initial approval.
“Psychedelic therapy isn’t really about chasing those altered states or skipping the hard work,” she said. “It’s about deepening that therapeutic process and kind of being able to get to the parts of that self that can be gotten through in conventional therapy alone.” 
Pulling back the layers
For about six years, Schroeder has been working with a client who has been committed and dedicated to their weekly sessions. But they hit a road block in their progress.
“Part of what they were trying to tap into and access was a deeper layer of fear from some childhood trauma,” she said, “and just weren’t able to get there.”
For years, her client would be triggered by certain things related to that childhood fear, and it would impact their daily life. Several months ago, the client went through psilocybin-assisted therapy with Schroeder.
“They were able to get to that layer and discharge that energy in such a way that they weren’t as activated all the time back in ordinary consciousness,” she said. 
And it wasn’t just immediate, temporary relief, Schroeder said. The benefits of the psilocybin therapy have remained months later. 
“There was a real deep, energetic, somatic nervous system shift for them,” she said. “It’s very powerful.”
For the treatment, her clients enter into a room similar to a regular therapy or meditation room, she said. Two main pieces of the experience are wearing an eye mask and listening to meditative music to help the clients go inward. 
As a psilocybin facilitator, Schroeder is there to hold a safe space for the experience. There isn’t much talking, unless the person needs help moving through certain feelings. 
One of the most important pieces is the preparation, she said. If a person who has experienced PTSD has certain triggers – such as claustrophobia or rage — that might come up during the session, there’s a lot of preparation to help resource the person on how to work through those feelings. 
A week prior, the clients follow a cleansing diet and censor any agitating or dysregulating things, she said. 
“Just like you pay attention to what you put in your body, it’s like paying attention to the energy that you’re around, and making sure you’re hydrating and sleeping and things like that.”
 Missouri psilocybin legislation

 State Rep. Dave Griffith, a Republican from Jefferson City (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
For the last three years, Missouri lawmakers have heard testimony from the veteran community about how psilocybin has helped veterans treat their PTSD in a way that prescription drugs or conventional therapy could not. 
Schroeder has been listening with much interest to the debate. During her training in Colorado, they explored research related to veterans and heard lectures and interviews about the issue.
“I, without a doubt, believe in the efficacy of this for that population,” she said. 
Schroeder works with PTSD and complex PTSD in her practice. 
“Trauma is an experience that’s kind of stuck in our bodies and in our nervous systems,” she said. “So that is why a lot of the time conventional therapeutic approaches, even medication, can only get so far, because we have to be able to get down to that nervous system and integrate the experiences. And then they take their rightful place.”
Veterans face elevated rates of PTSD and suicide, she said, so conventional treatments are often not enough. Psychedelic therapy offers more possibilities for that “profound, restorative change,” she said.  
“I appreciate that Missouri is taking a measured approach,” she said. “It’s an absolutely important option that we keep pursuing, not just with veterans, but there’s many, many, many people who could benefit from it.”
Like Schroeder, several Missouri lawmakers have repeatedly said during debates that they were staunchly opposed to the psilocybin legislation when they first heard about it.
Then they said they looked at the extensive research coming out of the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research.
“I’ve probably spent, I don’t know, 20 hours reading materials that came out of Johns Hopkins,” said state Rep. Dave Griffith, a Republican from Jefferson City and chair of the House Veterans Committee, last year. “The data that comes out of these studies that they’ve done is remarkable.”
He said he understands the idea may be outside some legislators’ “comfort zones.” 
“If you would have told me 10 years ago that I would be chairing a committee and listening to psychedelics, I would have told you, ‘You’re crazy,’” he said. “But I really have a passion for the struggles that my veteran brothers and sisters are going through, and I think we’ve got to look at the big picture.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-12-at-8.19.27 AM-1024x606.png,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

In March 2024, voters narrowly passed Proposition 1 — a mental health measure championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom that included a $6.4 billion bond to pay for the creation of housing and treatment facilities. 
More than a year later, how has the money been spent?
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall and Jocelyn Wiener explain, $4.4 billion of the bond money is earmarked for mental health and addiction treatment beds. The rest is for housing and support services for patients with mental illness or substance use disorders.
Last month the state released $3.3 billion to fund 124 projects across 42 counties, which should fund more than 5,000 treatment beds and 21,800 outpatient treatment slots, according to Newsom’s office. That’s about 74% of the beds and 82% of the outpatient slots the bond first pledged to fund.
Big counties received a large portion of the money — Los Angeles County got nearly $1 billion for 35 projects — but some rural counties, which are in the most need of mental health resources, also received grants. Fresno County, for example, won grants for four projects, including one that would enable Fresno Community Hospital and Medical Center to add 107 in-patient beds.
Though the money is a boon for health clinics and treatment centers, mental health advocates and county leaders have raised concerns about the speed of which the money is being distributed. California has historically awarded counties that can develop “launch ready” projects, which can be completed on a faster timeline. Prop. 1 is no exception, which could lead to the state bypassing funding for more complex, hard-to-build facilities, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office.
The application process for $800 million in grants is now open until Oct. 28, which Newsom’s office plans to distribute funds by next spring.

Trump threatens to freeze funds over trans athletes

After a transgender high school student in Jurupa Valley finished first- and second-place at a state track and field championship in May, President Donald Trump threatened to impose “large scale fines” against the state and to withhold federal funding. 
But can he really do that? 
California law allows transgender students in K-12 school districts to compete on teams that match their preferred gender, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman. But unless Congress or the U.S. Supreme Court steps in, the president lacks the authority to change the state’s law.
The U.S. Department of Justice did, however, send a letter last week arguing that the current policy violates federal law and is unconstitutional.
On Monday the state’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against the administration over the letter, and in a statement, California school chief Tony Thurmond said that “sending a letter does not change the law.” 
The federal government provides California over $2 billion annually for low-income schools and $1 billion for special education.

Huntington Beach rejects library review panel


Supporters of restricting library books display titles they want removed from the children’s section of the Huntington Beach Central Library during an event at Lake Park in Huntington Beach on May 31, 2025. Photo by Mette Lampcov for CalMatters




From CalMatters Capitol reporter Alexei Koseff:
After a combative campaign that devolved into fights about censorship and pornography, voters in Huntington Beach have rejected a committee to review library books for sexual content.
The special election that ended Tuesday pushed the Orange County community into the center of a national battle over free speech, parental rights and what material is available to children in public libraries. It also tested the power of an ascendant political movement led by the self-proclaimed “MAGA-nificent” city council, which in recent years has turned Huntington Beach into the bulwark of conservative resistance to California’s progressive governance.
With more than 50,000 ballots counted on Tuesday night, the campaign to repeal the community review board, created last year by the city council, led with 59% of the vote.

Spencer Hagaman, campaign manager to repeal the review board, in a statement: “We are united in protecting our libraries. No one will take away our freedom to read.”

But the city council’s push to restrict access to books that it considers obscene is likely to continue. Councilmember Gracey Van Der Mark was not ready to concede on Wednesday and noted that the election had raised awareness in Huntington Beach about the process for challenging library material.

Van Der Mark: “Our resolve and dedication to protecting our children remains strong. It remains unchanged.”

To assist California public employees, a bill introduced this year would allow newly hired police and firefighters to retire earlier, and increase the cap on how much California pensioners can earn in retirement. But former Gov. Jerry Brown says the proposal would make the state pension system “less secure.” Find out what happened to the bill from CalMatters’ Adam Ashton.






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom has asked the Legislature to fast-track the Delta tunnel project through the budget process, but Democratic legislators — divided roughly along north-south geographic lines — punted the issue instead.
CalMatters contributor Jim Newton: Antonio Villaraigosa, a former speaker of the Assembly and mayor of L.A., is magnetic, resilient and principled — and shouldn’t be underestimated as a candidate for California governor.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)As a Minnesota military family, we feel compelled to speak against the Los Angeles Marine deployment and address what we see as a far more troubling issue that affects every American family.
The deployment of active duty military forces against American citizens on American soil in a law enforcement capacity is fundamentally wrong and deeply dangerous to our republic.
Our Marines, soldiers, sailors and airmen take a sacred oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. They are trained to fight wars — not to police American communities.
When we blur the line between military force and civilian law enforcement, we abandon core principles that have protected our democracy for nearly 250 years.
The Posse Comitatus Act is 150-year old law that bans in most instances federal troops from engaging in civilian law enforcement. As Joseph Nunn of the Brennan Center for Justice writes, the law “embodies an American tradition that sees military interference in civilian affairs as a threat to both democracy and personal liberty.”
Our founders understood that military power must never be turned inward against the very people our service members have sworn to protect.
As a military family, we know the character of our service members. They are patriots who love this country and its people. They should never be put in the impossible position of having to choose between following orders and upholding their oath to protect American citizens’ constitutional rights.
This isn’t just another ho-hum political dispute — it’s about the fundamental nature of American democracy.
Military families have sacrificed enough. Our service members should not be used as tools of domestic enforcement against the communities they call home.
We call on all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, to reject the normalization of military deployment against civilians. Today it may not affect your family directly — but precedents set today will echo for generations.
Our military belongs on foreign battlefields protecting America, not on American streets policing Americans.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219573324.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Courtesy of MIRC)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an undocumented immigrant, hoped to finish high school in Detroit before returning to Colombia. That dream is likely over, his attorney said Wednesday, after his request for a stay of deportation was denied.
The Western International High School junior is in an immigration processing center in Louisiana, and his deportation is imminent, according to his legal team at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. Once Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, “have enough individuals to fill a plane to Colombia,” Maykol will likely be sent out of the U.S., Christine Sauvé, the organization’s communications manager, told Chalkbeat.
Even as dozens of people supporting Maykol packed the Detroit school board meeting Tuesday night, Ruby Robinson, his attorney, got word that the student had been moved to the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center in Louisiana. The news wasn’t a good sign – most charter ICE charter flights out of the country leave from Louisiana or Texas, the attorney said.
Officials from ICE did not immediately respond to confirm the status of Maykol’s case or his whereabouts.
The Detroit Public Schools Community District school board on Tuesday night made a public statement urging for the teen’s release so he can finish high school. Board members had been quiet about publicly advocating for Maykol’s release until hearing more than two hours of public comment from community members urging them to act.
Before the district made the statement, Robinson said support for the teen from his school would help his immigration case.
Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told Chalkbeat last week that the district has “done everything it can to protect students” while they are on school grounds. He added that Maykol was not “under the protection and responsibility of” the district when he was arrested during a traffic stop in May.
“Please help him,” one of Maykol’s friends pleaded with the board at the meeting through a translator.
Another speaker from Maykol’s neighborhood said the student’s detention is “heartbreaking” and “horrifying.”
Paula Duran, a parent of two students in the district, told the board ICE’s recent actions in the city, including detentions of students’ family members, are “destroying” the school community.
“All of us are impacted by this – the whole DPSCD community and the whole city of Detroit,” she said.
Multiple teachers told the board Maykol was a good student and a hard worker. He worked late night shifts as a doorman at a hotel, but always came to school eager to learn.
The teen was focused on earning his diploma and was only 3.5 credits away from his goal.
Maykol was arrested and detained by ICE after Rockwood police pulled him over for allegedly tailgating another car. He was driving a group of other newcomer boys as they attempted to join a field trip to Lake Erie Metropark, about 25 miles away from Detroit.
The boys had not turned in parental permission slips on time to join the trip on school buses with the other 70 to 80 other students who went, said Kristen Schoettle, one of his teachers.
“The kids wanted to be with the rest of their friends on the trip,” Schoettle told Chalkbeat.
As he was getting pulled over, Maykol called a friend in his class who was on the trip. The friend alerted Schoettle and other teachers. Schoettle said she asked an employee at the park to give her a ride to the scene of the traffic stop.
Once she arrived, the teacher said the Rockwood police did not speak Spanish and were having trouble communicating with Maykol. At that point, the police called Customs and Border Protection to translate for them, according to Robinson.
The teen wasn’t licensed to drive, according to Robinson, and only had a city identification card.
The teen already had been going through the legal process to return to Colombia. A judge issued a final order of deportation for the student in 2024, and Maykol was working with immigration officials and the Colombian Consulate to obtain a passport and the documentation he needed to board a plane with his mother.
Maykol planned on completing high school at Western International while those arrangements were made.
But those plans fell apart at the traffic stop.

The World Cup could bring more than $1 billion in economic activity, and plenty of tourists, to Massachusetts. Here’s what some are worrying about as the soccer games are a year out.
The post Could the Trump administration’s border policies affect 2026 World Cup tourism in Massachusetts? appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN SOCCER, maintaining possession of the ball is crucial. 
But as planning for 2026 World Cup matches in Massachusetts ramps up, state and local officials, who are hoping the games will lead to economic activity from tourists, may not be able to control the state of play when it comes to how federal border officers are treating visitors coming in from other countries. 
Multiple news reports in recent months have highlighted how some tourists have been stopped at the border, held inside immigration detention facilities but eventually allowed to head home. The headlines have travelers “freaked out,” as The Atlantic noted, and “online message boards have been humming with vacation worries” as well as advice. 
““There’s only so much our local authorities can do,” said Juliette Kayyem, a national security analyst who has worked for homeland security departments at both the federal and state level, under President Obama and Gov. Deval Patrick. “It’s the mood, it’s not the policy.” 
Tourism officials involved in the planning effort for local World Cup games expect a $1.1 billion economic boost to Massachusetts over three weeks next June and early July. Seven games, out of a total of 60 across the country, are set to take place inside Foxborough’s Gillette Stadium, which will be renamed Boston Stadium for the duration due to sponsorship rules under FIFA, the governing body that works to organize the World Cup. 
Two million visitors are expected to stream into Massachusetts, and organizers estimate 450,000 tickets will be sold. 
But local tourism officials are “not going to be able to overcome what’s happening day to day at our border,” Kayyem said. “German tourists being detained for six hours, people going missing. That stuff they can’t control.”
Even so, tourism officials are trying to stay positive. Martha Sheridan, the head of Meet Boston, the city’s nonprofit tourism agency, joined Mike Loynd, president and CEO of the Boston World Cup 2026 organizing committee, to unveil a countdown clock outside Faneuil Hall. The clock counts down to the first match on June 13 of next year. 
Sheridan acknowledged that her agency is preparing for a decrease in international visitors this year, primarily ones who come from Canada, which has balked at President Trump repeatedly declaring his desire to turn the country into the 51st US state.  
But she pointed to next summer’s World Cup as a unique draw that won’t be dampened by panicked travelers. “People will look at coming to the US as a place that’s safe and for the most part welcoming, and not alter their plans because it’s here,” said Sheridan. 
She noted Canada and Mexico are also hosting matches alongside the US. For international visitors looking to stay in one region, they can go see games in Toronto, the Boston area, New York, and Philadelphia. 
Asked about the detentions, Sheridan said, “Quite frankly, detentions do happen. I certainly don’t condone needless detentions. But what I’m hearing from some of our counterparts around the globe, a lot of what’s getting amplified are things that have already been happening for years, it’s now just very top of mind. But certainly, it’s a concern, we’re going to keep our eye on it, and I think for us, for the city of Boston, we’ll benefit from the fact that we do welcome all, and people will feel safe and welcome here.” 
She added that people traveled to Russia and Qatar for World Cup matches in 2018 and 2022, respectively. 
But while there were complaints about the two authoritarian countries known for human rights abuses hosting the World Cup, “at no stage did Qatar or Russia make themselves unwelcoming to the public that they wanted to come to the games, not in the way Trump is,” said Kayyem. 
Kayyem pointed to the new travel ban, mainly affecting Middle Eastern and African countries, as an example. The ban, which went into effect this week, applies to foreign nationals from 12 countries, including Haiti, Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Libya, and the Republic of Congo, among others.  Additionally, people from Cuba and Venezuela are among those who face heightened restrictions, according to NPR. 
The ban carries an exception for athletes and coaches, but that doesn’t include family, friends, and fans. 
Gov. Maura Healey and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who have clashed with the Trump administration on immigration issues and its attacks on Harvard University, are joining tourism officials in accentuating the potential for the World Cup to bring foot traffic, as well as a sense of connection and pride. Wu, a soccer fan herself, called it the “world’s unifying sport.”  
Asked about any concerns about the federal attitude towards some tourists, Wu told CommonWealth Beacon in April, “We’re taking everything day by day as best we can to prepare for unexpected circumstances but also not jump ahead to assume we should be pulling back or rescinding or slashing plans we have in place.” 
Healey took a similar tack on Wednesday before she headed to Boston University’s Nickerson Field for a “one year to go” event for the World Cup. Pointing to the opportunity for tourism dollars, Healey told reporters, “That’s what we’re really focused on. So in terms of how other things may factor in and play out, we’ll just have to wait and see.”

Gavin Newsom long insisted that he had no interest in running for president, despite rampant speculation. Now he’s publicly acknowledging that it’s a possibility.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom long insisted that he had no interest in running for president, despite rampant speculation. Now he’s publicly acknowledging that it’s a possibility.


Get ready, America. After years of firm denials, Gov. Gavin Newsom is finally acknowledging his presidential ambitions.
Over the past month, the Democratic governor who once insisted that he had “sub-zero interest” in the White House has begun publicly inching toward the idea. In a profile published in the Wall Street Journal this week, Newsom said he would wait to see if the moment felt right.
“I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold,” he said.
The shift in tone comes, perhaps fortuitously, as all eyes are on Newsom again.
With President Donald Trump sending military troops into Los Angeles in recent days to quell sometimes unruly protests against immigration enforcement raids, Newsom has seized the moment to reestablish himself as the leader of the resistance. The governor sued to stop the deployments and is now doing nearly endless rounds in the media accusing Trump of slipping into authoritarianism. He has sent daily queries to his fundraising list referencing the situation in Los Angeles and the president advocating for his arrest.
On Tuesday evening, Newsom gave a short video address, carried live on CNN, that sought to elevate his fight to national significance, warning that “other states are next,” and to rally the public behind him to defend democracy.
“This is about all of us. This is about you,” Newsom said. “It’s time for all of us to stand up.”
Many people already assume that Newsom is in campaign mode. A poll released last month by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times found that more than half of California voters believe Newsom is more focused on boosting his presidential prospects than governing the state and solving its problems.
But the ability to expand his message beyond California could stir voters in the rest of the country to start seeing Newsom as a potential leader, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. 
He commended Newsom for channeling the growing fear and anger over Trump’s actions in his remarks, which Sabato believes may have changed the minds of some skeptics who regarded the governor as just “another pol with good hair gel.”
“He saw the danger to the American republic,” Sabato said. “It was a home run.”
Though speculation about a future presidential bid has followed Newsom throughout his career — his family even joked about it in a congratulatory message in his college yearbook — he never would have admitted that he had his eye on the White House even a few years ago.
After defeating a recall attempt in 2021, Newsom told NBC’s Chuck Todd in an interview that he had “never” considered running for president and had “no, no, no, no, no” interest in ever doing so because “who needs the damn stress?”
During an endorsement interview with the San Francisco Chronicle during his re-election campaign for California governor the following year, Newsom said he had “sub-zero interest” in being commander in chief and that “it’s not even on my radar.” He reiterated to CBS that “it’s not my ambition” and “I have no interest” in ever running.
The question came up again repeatedly last summer as frantic Democrats considered whether to replace President Joe Biden on the ticket, and Newsom always loyally batted it down, emerging as perhaps Biden’s most forceful surrogate until the bitter end.
Newsom’s star has risen in recent years
Whether those proclamations were sincere is, of course, another matter.
Newsom’s political star exploded with his early handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and he has spent the years since burnishing his national profile — touring red states to campaign for fellow Democrats, proposing a constitutional amendment to restrict gun ownership, debating Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Fox News, launching a controversy-generating podcast. The recent book “Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House” reported that Newsom was among the prominent Democrats who contacted campaign operatives last summer to explore their chances if Biden dropped out.

Representatives for Newsom did not respond to questions about why he is speaking differently now about a potential presidential campaign and whether it represents an intentional strategy. But the switch has been notable and consistent in recent weeks.
In early May, Newsom told the video podcast Next Up with Mark Halperin that his decision was “to be determined.”
“I might. I don’t know,” he said. “But I have to have a burning ‘why’ and I have to have a compelling vision that distinguishes myself from anybody else. Without that, without both and, I don’t deserve to even be in the conversation.”
On his own podcast last week, guest Dr. Phil asked Newsom whether he was running for president in 2028 and the governor did not rule it out. “You’re not ruling anything out about your future either, so we’ll leave it at that,” he said.
If Newsom does ultimately enter the race, voters are unlikely to care about his pivot from past pledges that he would not, Sabato said, because it will be so expected.
“If you’re governor of California, the assumption is that you’re running for president,” he said.
And broken promises seem to matter little in politics anymore, Sabato added, “The one thing that Trump has done for everyone is eliminate the issue of hypocrisy.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/011024_Newsom-Jan-Budget_MG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

The largest source of federal homelessness grant dollars now includes restrictions on promoting DEI language and concerns.


Homeless service providers across California — and as much as $683 million in federal funding for the state’s most economically vulnerable residents — have been caught up in the Trump administration’s war on “wokeness.” 
Beginning earlier this spring, organizations that use federal Continuum of Care Program grant money to provide housing, rental assistance, street outreach and other services to tens of thousands of unhoused Californians started receiving notification from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that those dollars now come with an unusual list of conditions. Grantees would be barred from using the funds to promote “gender ideology,” “elective abortions,” and “illegal immigration,” among other restrictions.
Violating those terms carries a possible financial penalty valued at three times the grant amount and even criminal charges, according to communications the care providers received from the federal housing department. The conditions are part of a broader effort spearheaded in a set of executive orders signed within hours of his inauguration to purge the federal bureaucracy and federally-funded programs of “illegal DEI” and “gender ideology extremism.”
For the charities, faith-based organizations, public housing authorities and local governments that accept these grants, the new conditions present a dilemma. They can agree to terms, hopefully keeping themselves out of the administration’s crosshairs but, some service providers say, potentially undercutting their ability to help California’s most vulnerable by doing so. Or they can fight back, and risk a costly legal battle, a potential loss of funding and the possible ire of a president with a penchant for political retaliation.
Santa Clara and San Francisco counties have opted for the second path.
In May, the two counties joined a lawsuit against the Department of Housing and Urban Development alongside 29 other local governments and agencies. The coalition argues that the Trump administration overstepped its constitutional powers in tacking on the culture war-inspired restrictions on spending approved by Congress, that it did so without following the rules that govern regulatory changes and that the restrictions themselves are “unconstitutionally vague.” 
The federal housing department said it will comply with the court’s order, according to Santa Clara Public Information Officer Peter Gallotta. But that the county has so far been unable to access the $4.6 million covered by grant agreements and the court order, he added. 
The nearly 40-year-old Continuum of Care grant is the largest single source of federal grant dollars aimed at addressing homelessness. In the last fiscal year, more than 200 California local governments, public housing authorities and nonprofits were awarded $683 million. That includes San Francisco with $50 million and Santa Clara County with $34 million.
The restrictions present the providers with the impossible choice of either “accepting illegal conditions that are without authority, contrary to the Constitution, and accompanied by the poison pill of heightened (legal) risk,” the groups wrote in their legal filing, “or foregoing the benefit of grant funds — paid for (at least partially) through local federal taxes — that are necessary for crucial local services.”
Among the restrictions at issue, the federal contract prevents any government agency that receives grant funds from abetting “policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.” 
Such terms made it impossible for Santa Clara County to sign the agreement, said county counsel Tony LoPresti. “There are all kinds of policies that benefit undocumented immigrants, so it’s just not clear what they would wrap into that definition,” he said. “It gives (the administration) an incredible amount of license to interpret that in ways that are completely unconstitutional and unlawful and then to hold that over our heads for purposes of receiving this grant funding.”
So far the “fight back” strategy appears to be working: Last week a federal judge in Seattle ordered the federal government to hold off on enforcing the terms of its conditions on the cities and counties in the lawsuit until the constitutional questions can be resolved at trial. 
The local governments “are likely to prevail in their claim” that the federal government has “run afoul of the Separation of Powers doctrine and were acting in excess of statutory authority,” Judge Barbara Jacobs Rothstein wrote in the June 3 order. 
The press office at the Housing and Urban Development Department did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. 
Signing and hoping for the best
Taking the Trump administration to court is not a strategy available to most Continuum of Care grant recipients. 
“I think it’s more important to provide the service,” said Carol Roberts, president and CEO of Lutheran Social Services of Northern California. Her organization signed a contract in the spring for a nearly $630,000 grant to house homeless clients with disabilities in Solano County. “Our program in Solano County houses 22 individuals who were chronically homeless. And it does good work,” Roberts said. “So I’m willing to comply with the contract language, I guess.”
Small nonprofits and charities don’t always have ready access to a lawyer, the money to hire outside counsel or the time and resources to backfill any anticipated grant money that doesn’t come through, said Ann Oliva, CEO at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. 
“Most of the nonprofit grantees that we’ve talked to who have received their grant agreements already are signing them, and they’re waiting to see what happens with this bigger lawsuit,” she said. “They’re in a situation where they’ve got to pay somebody’s rent or those folks are going to start getting evicted…Most of them don’t really see much of a choice here.”
“As nonprofits, we’re sort of used to signing ridiculous things and then just doing great work.”Vivian Wan, CEO, Abode Services
The injunction in the Santa Clara County and San Francisco case only applies to the plaintiffs in the case. That means that the hundreds of organizations that didn’t join the suit and have signed the grant agreements are now on the hook for complying with its terms.
Not everyone is entirely clear what that compliance looks like.
In Contra Costa County, Christy Saxton worries the new contract language will make it harder to house people in certain vulnerable groups, such as members of the transgender community and undocumented immigrants. The county might have to avoid using federally funded housing vouchers for those people, said Saxton, director of Health, Housing and Homeless Services for the county. That could mean those people remain homeless for longer. 
The Trump administration’s definition of “gender ideology,” something the grant agreement forbids groups from promoting, includes anything that perpetuates the “false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.” 
“That will potentially make it harder for us to find housing for certain people,” Saxton said. “But we are committed. We have other state funding that supports people. We have local funding that supports people.”
Saxton’s department is still waiting for its HUD contract, she said. 
Roberts initially wasn’t sure if or how to change the programming at Lutheran Social Services because the contract language is so vague. She and her team had to get their attorney on the phone — twice — to figure it out. In the end, they decided staff will remove pronouns and diversity slogans (such as a colorful hummingbird next to the words “equality diversity inclusion”) from their email signatures. Her organization also folded its Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Committee into its Trauma Informed Care Committee. 
Interestingly, the contract that Roberts was most worried about — one that funds housing for people living with AIDS in San Francisco — arrived without any new language about gender, racial equity or immigration, she said. 
“DEI is Dead”
While removing pronouns from an email signature may seem like a small price to pay in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal funding, some service providers are worried about the broader implications of this shift. 
Erika Lee, co-executive director of Venice Community Housing, fears chilling diversity, equity and inclusion efforts will hamper her organization’s work to address the fact that Black people are disproportionately likely to be homeless, both in Los Angeles and across the state. 
“There’s no question that our system has discriminatorily excluded folks from housing,” said Lee, whose organization is still waiting for its nearly $820,000 HUD contract. “So to have anti-DEI language in contracts, it’s a step back.”
An earlier version of the grant agreements HUD sent out did explicitly bar grantees from operating “programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.” More recent versions of the contract did not include that language. But both HUD Secretary Scott Turner and the administration have made it abundantly clear where they stand on such programs. “DEI is dead at HUD,” Turner said in a written statement in March.
Sacramento Steps Forward, which leads the county’s continuum of care, recently signed a $40.5 million HUD contract for homeless housing and services and will disburse that money to nonprofits throughout the county. 
The continuum of care board on Wednesday voted to scrub references to “racial equity,” “inequities,” “equality” and “diversity” from its governance charter document. That includes removing references to opportunities for diversity awareness and racial equity training. 
It also eliminated its Racial Equity Committee, which was made up mostly of members who are Black, Indigenous and people of color, many of whom have been homeless themselves. 
The board is replacing that group with a Community Accountability Committee.
Still, other organizations have signed and are moving ahead without making any changes.
Vivian Wan, CEO of Abode Services, was shocked to read what she called the “scary language” in the grant agreement documents for the six rental assistance programs administered by the Bay Area-based nonprofit. But ultimately, she and Abode’s staff decided the stipulations were so vague and so detached from the actual work they do that the language added up to “a lot of bark and not a lot of bite.”
“I wasn’t willing to make a political stand on the backs of formerly homeless people that are receiving the dollars,” said Wan. 
Many of the grants that Abode draws on to fund its services include terms that are difficult to monitor, enforce or even understand, she added. HUD’s current list of conditions may be especially “egregious,” but “as nonprofits, we’re sort of used to signing ridiculous things and then just doing great work.”
“A really significant hit”
Slapping new restrictions on grant funds is just one of an array of current or pending federal policy changes that could upend the way that the federal government provides assistance to people experiencing or at the risk of homelessness. These included reported mass layoffs at HUD, the White House’s proposed 44% reduction in spending on the department and its proposal to provide no additional funding for Continuum of Care grants, instead folding it into another program. 
“It’s not just about the words that are in the grant agreement,” said Oliva. “It’s also not having enough people to actually administer these grants. It’s potentially zeroing it out in the President’s budget. What kind of risks does that bring for an organization?”
In Contra Costa County, the proposed cuts would cost at least 3,000 households their short or long-term housing placements or rental subsidies, estimated Saxton, director of Health, Housing and Homeless Services for the county. 
“That’s a really significant hit for Contra Costa,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/100323-DignityMoves-Tiny-Homes-LE-CM-06.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Now, see where that money is going","Marisa Kendall, Jocelyn Wiener and Erica Yee",,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/mental-health/2025/06/prop-1-mental-health-awards/,It can take a long time to build anything in California. The governor's office is trying to move fast on mental health projects funded by a new bond.,"In summary
It can take a long time to build anything in California. The governor’s office is trying to move fast on mental health projects funded by a new bond.


A little more than a year after Californians approved a $6.4 billion mental health bond with a nail-bitingly close vote, we’re getting our first glimpse into how that money will be spent. 
Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom awarded nearly half of the money to projects that range from a crisis stabilization unit in rural Del Norte County to a residential addiction treatment program for mothers in Los Angeles. The initial $3.3 billion should fund more than 5,000 treatment beds and 21,800 outpatient treatment slots for people struggling with their mental health or addiction, according to his office. 
That’s 74% of the beds and 82% of the outpatient treatment slots that the bond initially promised.
“It’s the issue of our time, and we’re not taking our time,” Newsom said during a news conference about the funding. “We’re addressing this crisis with that sense of urgency that you deserve.”
Mental health advocates and county leaders say they are impressed with the speed with which the state has allocated awards, and with improved geographic distribution to areas like the Central Valley when compared to past rounds of funding. 
But they are also voicing concerns that California is rushing a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” without adequately analyzing the types of mental health services the state most needs. This analysis is especially important, they say, given that Newsom unrolled a raft of new mental health and substance use policies over the past few years. 
Adding to the complexity: massive state and federal funding cuts are looming for mental health services.
While calling the bond “unbelievably significant,” Michelle Cabrera, executive director of the County Behavioral Health Directors Association, said the new state policies will require investment in specialized forms of treatment. In part for this reason, she would have liked for counties to be able to “hit pause and really reflect on what’s around the corner.”
“I think we were surprised by the drive to go so hard right now when there’s still a lot that needs to be worked out,” she said.
More even distribution of funds
Now, you may be wondering: Where is all this money going? Is any going to my community? And, how long before I can expect to see results?
Los Angeles County received a little over $1 billion for 35 projects. The nine-county Bay Area won almost $500 million for 19 projects. Fresno County, which in recent years has been overlooked for such funds, won awards for four different projects.The greatest number of grants went toward residential facilities treating substance use disorders in adults, followed closely by outpatient addiction programs and mental health clinics. But money also went toward sobering centers, “peer respite” programs staffed by people who have experienced their own mental health challenges, and programs specifically for children and adolescents. 
That money comes from Proposition 1, which California voters approved by the slimmest of margins — 50.2% to 49.8% — in March 2024. About $4.4 billion of that $6.4 billion bond is for mental health and addiction treatment beds. The rest is for permanent housing that comes with services and support for people struggling with mental illness or addiction.
The funding is supposed to bolster Newsom’s larger mental health agenda. He signed legislation that makes it easier to place people in treatment (both voluntarily and involuntarily), and attempted to crack down on the homeless encampments where people grappling with mental illness or addiction sometimes live.

But some mental health advocates worry the state doesn’t even know what services already exist in each county, let alone having a clear picture of the types of treatment that will be necessary to meet demand created by these new policies. 
“It really can’t be overstated how much of an issue it is that the state doesn’t have a system for doing this,” said Corey Hashida, a senior research associate with the Steinberg Institute, a Sacramento-based mental health advocacy organization. In their research, Hashida and his colleagues have found a shortage of short-term crisis beds around the state. Despite the fact that those types of beds tend to be less costly and less restrictive, he said, much of the focus has centered on creating inpatient psychiatric beds.
In addition to the $3.3 billion in Prop. 1 money already spoken for, applications recently opened for $800 million, which Newsom’s office plans to award to fund more treatment beds next spring. Another $2 billion will go toward new permanent housing as part of Newsom’s Homekey+ program — including $1 billion earmarked for veterans. The state is expected to decide those awards this summer. 
The money for treatment beds will be funneled through an existing state program that has doled out $1.8 million to help build facilities for mental health and substance use treatment since its launch in 2021. With the influx of Prop. 1 money, the program will expand by nearly 150%.
But the existing behavioral health grant program hasn’t always met California’s needs, according to a report this year by the state Legislative Analyst’s Office. 
The southern San Joaquin Valley (Fresno, Inyo, Kern, Kings and Tulare counties) has the greatest need for more adult inpatient mental health beds, according to an estimate by the RAND think tank. Yet, prior to Prop. 1, the state grants funded no beds of that type in that region, according to the LAO report. Instead, 55% of adult inpatient mental health beds funded by the grants were in the places least likely to need them: San Diego and Los Angeles counties, the northern San Joaquin Valley and the north-eastern corner of the state, from Modoc to Sacramento counties.
In the past, Fresno County was one of the areas left out of state funding awards despite needing  more psychiatric treatment beds, said Susan Holt, director of the county’s Department of Behavioral Health. When the county’s beds are full, patients have to go to the surrounding counties — or sometimes as far as Northern or Southern California — to find care, she said.
Even so, the state rejected two applications in 2022 that would have helped Fresno County build new psychiatric facilities. A third application was granted, but the state Department of Health Care Services rescinded the money after the building the county intended to renovate and turn into a residential treatment center burned down. 
The region’s luck appears to have changed with Prop. 1. Fresno County’s three awards in the latest funding round should help the county create 32 new in-patient beds and 2,255 outpatient treatment slots. One of the new facilities will be a locked unit for people suffering from severe substance use disorder, or both mental illness and substance use disorder. That’s being created in response to a law Newsom signed in 2023 that, starting last year, has made it easier to compel people with serious mental illnesses and substance use disorders to receive involuntary treatment. 
A fourth award, to Fresno Community Hospital and Medical Center, will allow the hospital to add 107 in-patient beds.
The fact that the Central Valley fared well this time, Holt said, is  “a very good indication that the state is working to evaluate where the gaps are and allocate resources accordingly.”
Another area that won out this time is the North Coast region of California, which stretches from Del Norte to Sonoma counties. It received the most money per-capita of any region — more than $24 million per 100,000 residents.
Of that money, $4 million will go to Sutter Coast Hospital to help build Del Norte County’s first psychiatric facility. Because there currently are no inpatient or outpatient treatment units in the entire county, patients needing psychiatric care sometimes have to travel as far as Sacramento, a nearly seven-hour drive. 
The $4 million grant will fund a new outpatient crisis facility in Crescent City, where patients can stabilize for up to 23 hours before being discharged or transferred to a longer-term facility.
“This one we thought was going to be a long shot,” said Jodi Nerell, director of local mental health engagement for Sutter Health, who pointed out that prior state grants rarely funded these types of facilities in rural areas. She called it “a huge win.” The Crescent City project is expected to open in the first quarter of 2026.
Tight timelines for Prop. 1 projects 
Ten of the Prop. 1 projects are supposed to be finished this year, including four this summer — a quick turnaround in a state where high construction costs and tricky permitting processes often lead to project delays. A CalMatters investigation of a 2018 $2 billion housing bond shows how big promises can lead to disappointment. More than five years after California voters approved No Place Like Home, just 1,797 of the 20,000 homes promised for people living with mental illness had been built.
“The timelines are tight,” Holt, from Fresno County’s Department of Behavioral Health, said of the Prop. 1 funds. “We are working feverishly to address all of the conditions, but they are mighty. And it is a very complex process to execute these projects.”
Prop. 1 dollars are intended to fund “launch ready” projects that can be finished quickly. That means applicants have to prove a long list of factors, including that they own or have a long-term lease for the project site, they have the support of the surrounding community, and that they also have their own funding to pour into the project. 
Despite that, county leaders say some of the same issues that delayed No Place Like Home construction — such as NIMBYism — could still prove an issue this time. Cabrera, of the County Behavioral Health Directors Association, said it’s important to continue to track the implementation and sustainability of these projects over time. 
“We can look at something on paper and decide that ‘yes, it’s what the community needs,’ and then when we get to the local planning and approvals process, we get stuck in that,” she said.

The state was prioritizing launch-ready projects even before Prop. 1. But that mindset can make it harder for small and disadvantaged applicants to apply, and can mean the state misses out on funding complex, hard-to-build facilities, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office report.
That’s part of the reason Kern County didn’t try for Prop. 1 funding in round one, said Alison Burrowes, director of the county’s behavioral health department. The county has a lengthy process it must adhere to before it buys property or kicks off a building project, which doesn’t align with the state’s quick-turnaround attitude, Burrowes said. 
“For us to have the land and the shovel-ready projects,” she said, “we just didn’t have anything in the wings.” Instead, Kern County supported the city of Bakersfield as it sought (and won) a grant for an outpatient substance use treatment facility. 
Rural communities have it particularly tough, said Nerell of Sutter Health. Submitting these applications requires a huge administrative lift, and small, rural facilities don’t have staff to dedicate to that task, she said. 
“It’s a challenge for small communities in rural areas to go after these types of things because it just requires a lot of all hands on deck,” Nerell said. “It was a daunting task thinking of how we could do this in a rural area.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-Fresno-Hospital-LV-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

But he is nothing if not persistent.","One bad bet in California politics in recent decades has been to assume that Antonio Villaraigosa, who’s now in the hunt for the governorship, was finished. Underestimating him is a fool’s game.
Some people thought he’d never make the transition from Sacramento, where he was the speaker of the Assembly, back to Los Angeles, where he’s from. Some thought he was through after losing the mayor’s race in 2001 to then-City Attorney James Hahn. Many people figured he was done after his marriage blew up during his mayoralty. 
All of those people were wrong.
Villaraigosa was elected to the Los Angeles City Council soon after losing the 2001 mayoral race. He then won his rematch against Hahn in 2005 and was easily reelected in 2009. Even critics credited him with important achievements as mayor, particularly lowered crime and vast new investments in public transit.
Here he comes again. No longer the brash young organizer, Villaraigosa is now 72, but he’s got another campaign in him, and he’s making his second stab at the governorship. 
No Los Angeles mayor has ever made the jump, but Villaraigosa is nothing if not persistent.
I’ve known him a long time. We first met in 2000, when he was a relatively unknown figure in Los Angeles politics. It has not always been an easy ride, and we’ve had our differences. Villaraigosa is talkative and bubbling with ideas, but he enjoys the sound of his own voice and rarely slows down to listen to anyone else. He’s magnetic — guests at any event are drawn to him — but he tends to hold forth. He wears people out.
And yet, that same energy that I first saw in a restaurant booth at our initial meeting is still there. He loves the attention, but he also knows that he has the chance to do something with it. He’s resilient and principled.
In this round, Villaraigosa has a couple things going for him, as well as a couple big, looming obstacles. The latter include two potential missing pieces in the race: former Vice President Kamala Harris and Los Angeles developer Rick Caruso.
Caruso is the lesser threat to Villaraigosa’s ambitions. Rich, white and self-absorbed, Caruso could elbow his way into the runoff as a moderate outside the Democratic Party mainstream — he’s only been a Democrat for a few years, after all. But that’s not a simple task, and it’s easier to see how he could finish second than first.
Caruso can self-finance, but it’s not clear where else his support would come from. Major Republican donors want him to pass on this race so that they can coalesce around a MAGA candidate (a sure-fire track to losing in 2026. See: Steve Garvey). And the state’s liberal elites showed their disdain for Caruso in his 2022 mayoral campaign against Karen Bass, who beat him by 10 points despite spending $100 million on his own campaign. His path to the governorship, if he has one, is narrow.
Harris is another story. There’s no love lost between her and Villaraigosa. In 2016, when U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer announced that she would not seek another term, it opened the gate for a chance to succeed her. Harris moved more quickly than Villaraigosa to mobilize a campaign and boxed him out, frustrating his bid for statewide office. 
They’ve mended some fences since — he enthusiastically supported her against Donald Trump, an easy call — but should she enter the governor’s race, she would cast a long shadow over every other candidate, including Villaraigosa. He wouldn’t mind running against her, but she’d be the clear favorite.
He professes little interest in the plans of either Caruso or Harris. “I’m in it no matter who gets in,” Villaraigosa told me last week, adding that the governorship is “not a stepping stone,” a light dig at Harris. “I’m in this race, and I’m ready to lead on day one.”
That last comment is telling — in two ways. Villaraigosa is a competitor, and he’s good at it. And yet, for all his formidable political skills and his impressive resume, Villaraigosa can come across as rehearsed. He likes to talk about “not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good,” about being a “problem-solver,” and, yes, about being “ready to lead on day one.” 
None of that is false or offensive, but it’s political patter.
“I’m not protecting refineries or oil. I’m protecting the middle-class and working families who can’t afford $8 a gallon for gas.”Antonio Villaraigosa, former Los Angeles mayor and candidate for governor
When he lays off his talking points, he’s better. Villaraigosa rightfully recalls that he helped California extend universal health care to children, that he’s been a champion of clean air for decades, that he presided over sharp declines in L.A. crime, that he demanded lawful behavior from the city’s police without calling to defund the department. 
He’s “unabashedly progressive,” but he’s more of a leader than an ideologue. Being mayor helped him learn and practice that. More than any candidate in the race, he can point to real executive experience in government.
He’s a little shakier on his political support, notably the backing that he’s received from oil and gas interests. That support is unexpected given Villaraigosa’s dedication to easing climate change and to environmental protection generally, and it has not escaped notice that fossil fuel interests are helping him raise money in the early, difficult stages of his race. 
Why, it’s fair to ask, would oil and gas groups support a candidate who touts his record on climate change?
He knows the question is coming, and he’s ready with an answer, albeit a somewhat pat one. When it comes to energy, he said, he’s for “all of the above.” He supports development of wind and solar and geothermal, as well as small nuclear. And he wants to protect the state’s oil refineries, too, but he wants to be clear about why. 
“I’m not protecting refineries or oil,” he insisted, “I’m protecting the middle-class and working families who can’t afford $8 a gallon for gas.”
So Villaraigosa re-enters the fray, bringing all his energy, his vanity, his thoughtful positions and his rehearsed replies, his ambition and his undeniable commitment to service. He can be exhausting — believe me, I know — but just when you think you’re tired of him, he hits his stride.
In our conversation last week, that reminder came when we briefly hit upon the events taking place around us. As we spoke, masked federal agents were rounding up Angelenos, yanking them from workplaces and families and shipping them to points unknown. Protesters were rising up, and Trump was spoiling for a fight. 
A more cautious politician might wait for those events to calm down before weighing in. Not Villaraigosa. When the subject turned to the immigration raids, suddenly his patter was gone and his voice hardened.
“What we saw yesterday,” he said, “you’d have to be a calloused human being not to be affected.” It was nothing less, he added, than “hard-working people being rounded up like animals.”
In this instance, Villaraigosa was not calculating. He was openly, unambiguously appalled and unafraid to say so. 
“I know this state,” he said. “I know these people.”
He does. And that’s why it’s a mistake ever to underestimate Antonio Villaraigosa.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/081122-NEWSOM-WATER-PRESSER-MHN-20-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

The 9% proposed rate hike is expected to cost the average customer an additional $15 to $20 a month. 
An expert witness testifying on behalf of the BCP, Mark Garrett, says NV Energy, based on a formula used to determine its revenue requirement, needs a rate hike of $106 million to provide service to its customers in the south. 
NV Energy’s proposed rate hike panned by some, praised by others at consumer sessions

The utility is asking the PUC to include in the rate hike the cost of constructing Greenlink, a massive transmission line project, while it is still under construction and not benefitting ratepayers. 
Greenlink’s cost has ballooned from just under $2.5 billion to more than $4.2 billion, and could increase even more, depending on the outcome of President Donald Trump’s trade wars with Mexico and Canada.  
The increase related to Greenlink alone would hike rates by $60.6 million, or about $3.60 a month, for a little more than two years. 
The company argues that including the cost of construction while in progress, which is usually not permitted because it requires customers to pay for a service not yet provided, will generate cash flow, and help maintain credit ratings. 
In 2021, NV Energy’s then-CEO Doug Cannon told state lawmakers that “Nevadans will not be asked to pay for this investment until at least five to six years down the road.”
Cannon left the company last month, following the revelation that the utility overcharged some 80,000 customers, some going back as far as 20 years. 
“The company is faced with meeting the demands of growth, addressing system reliability, resource adequacy, legislative goals and mandates, and operational needs as it relates to sufficient levels of staffing, technology, and insurance – all of which necessitates investments above those currently reflected in the existing revenue requirement,” NV Energy vice president and chief financial officer Mike Behrens said in testimony submitted to the PUC, justifying the utility’s rate requests. 
Behrens testified that including the costs of constructing Greenlink, while work is in progress, would help avoid a bond rating downgrade and higher interest rates on future debt.
Garrett, on behalf of the BCP, recommended the cost of constructing Greenlink not be included in the upcoming rate case. 
“The company has not demonstrated a financial need,” Garrett countered, and said the claim that charging customers now for constructing the project would save money “is inaccurate.” 
While including the cost of construction in progress in the base rate would save the company $35 million in interest, it would cost customers $52.7 million in higher rates, and “makes no economic sense for ratepayers,” Garrett testified.  
NV Energy is also seeking to recoup $16.4 million in affiliate expenses incurred by the company or its affiliates, such as Berkshire Hathaway Energy, its holding company.
Among the expenses is an invoice for just under $1.3 million for Red Rock Resort, including $14,940 for incidentals, $152,156 for “guest room attrition,” $575,068 for banquet food and beverages, $17,140 for internet, $78,482 for audio/visual services, and $3,248 for luggage porters.
Nichole Loar of the BCP recommended the PUC disallow all $16.4 million in affiliate expenses – including: 

Chauffeured transportation services;
Washington, D.C. office building and related labor;
“Excessive lodging charges” at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C. and the J.W. Marriott in Phoenix;
Lobbying expenses;
Outside counsel;  
Corporate airfare; 
Alcoholic beverages; 
Entertainment; and
Charitable donations 

“The utility needs to be reminded they operate with a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (given by the PUC), which is a privilege to serve as a monopolistic entity, not a right,” Loar testified. 
NV Energy said in a statement the corporate expenses were “accidentally included as part of the pending southern Nevada general rate review filing.  The Company is reviewing these unintentional charges and is committed to removing any charges that were incorrectly included in this case so that customers are not affected.”
“The recent proposed increases are placing vulnerable demographics at a heightened risk for heat-related illnesses, such as heatstroke,” Las Vegan Angel DeFazio of the National Toxic Encephalopathy Foundation said in a news release following a consumer input session last week on the proposed increase. She noted that seniors and others on fixed incomes are challenged to cover essential expenses, such as food and medicine, and pay for energy, especially during the summer months when bills skyrocket. 
The PUC is expected to hold hearings on the proposed rate hike in September. If approved, rates would increase on Oct. 1.

A law that maintains diversity on the Alabama Real Estate Appraisers Board remains after case challenging it is dismissed. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit last week that challenged a state law and administrative regulation requiring the Alabama Real Estate Appraisers Board to have at least two minority members.
U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker, Jr. dismissed the case on Friday after both parties agreed to end the proceedings after the plaintiff in the case, American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER), objected to being subjected to discovery.
With both parties agreeing to end the litigation, Huffaker then agreed to the stipulations from both parties and ended the case with prejudice.
The American Alliance for Equal Rights (AAER), a group founded by anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, argued that a 1989 law requiring that “no less than two of the nine board members shall be of a minority race” on the board violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Huffaker, appointed to the bench by President Donald Trump, dismissed the case without weighing in on the merits of the case after the litigants agreed to end it.
Pamela Wyatt, president of the Alabama Association of Real Estate Brokers (AAREB), a mostly-Black organization that intervened to preserve the law, said in a statement that the case “allowed us to demonstrate how important state laws ensuring diversity on state boards are to people in Alabama.”
“State boards make decisions that affect all Alabamians and should be reflective of the communities they serve,” the statement said. “For the past three decades, this Alabama law has aimed to ensure that state boards reflect the state’s rich diversity, and we are thrilled that this case has been dismissed with prejudice.”
The association intervened in the case after Gov. Kay Ivey’s office said in court filings that the regulations were an “unconstitutional requirement that ‘she does not—and will not—enforce,’” according to court documents. The governor’s office did object to AAER’s challenge to inclusivity language in the statute.
Blum, the founder of the AAER, brought a lawsuit that led to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2023 to strike down race-conscious college admissions.
The AAER sued the state after the appraisers board rejected an application filed by Laura Clark, a member of AAER, because her appointment would have violated state statute that at least two of the board members be nonwhite.
Clark, who is white, also serves as the interim president of the Alabama Center for Law and Liberty, a conservative nonprofit law firm that says it advocates for  “limited government, free markets, and strong families.”
The AAREB said Alabama’s long history of racial discrimination in housing made minority representation on the state appraisal board critical to fairness.
“This particular law is critically important for that organization and many, many, other real estate professionals of color, and people of color in the state, who will suffer immensely if the law is struck down,” said Brooke Menschel, an attorney with Democracy Forward, representing the AAREB, last year.
The parties proceeded to discovery last July after Huffaker rejected a request for summary judgment filed by AAER for the court to rule in its favor.
AAER was listed as a plaintiff in the case, which subjected it to discovery. That meant opposing counsel could depose the members and staff of the organization and request documents to be used as evidence during litigation.
“Rather than continue to litigate an issue that both plaintiff and defendant agree is unconstitutional, we went ahead and agreed to have the case be dismissed,” said Haley Dutch, an attorney with Pacific Legal Foundation.
In the spring, AAER requested to be removed as a party to the case and have Clark added instead, which would have subjected her to discovery.
“AAER brought this case on Ms. Clark’s behalf, relying on the doctrine of associational standing to assert her interests, not its own,” AAER said in a request filed with the court in March to substitute Clark for AAER as the plaintiff. “AAER is thus not a necessary or indispensable party to the litigation.”
Democracy Forward opposed the request.
“It is a fundamental rule of litigation that when you choose to sue you have to expose yourself to discovery,” Democracy Forward said in a filing in April opposing the substitution. “AAER has a clear choice. If AAER does not want to litigate this case, it may voluntarily dismiss this litigation and Ms. Clark can file a new case if and when she has standing with regard to a live controversy. But if AAER wants to maintain this action, it must sit for a deposition, like all other litigants. It cannot shirk its discovery obligations.”
Huffaker rejected the request for substitution.
“What does appear clear is that AAER declared itself the jockey in a race that it started and has ridden this horse in this manner since February 2024,” Huffaker said. “Clark could have been the jockey from the outset, but AAER chose not to proceed in that manner. Similarly, AAER could have switched riders (i.e., Clark for AAER) well before the amended pleadings deadline.”
“The Court will not tolerate such tactics,” Huffaker added.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Alabama-State-Capitol-Feb-4-2025-02-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer) Minnesota public defenders narrowly voted to stick with the Teamsters following a rancorous campaign by some rank-and-file members to break away and start an independent union.
The yearlong push intensified longstanding political and personal conflict within the union of more than 550 Minnesota public defenders.
The divisions mirror a longstanding debate within the labor movement about its fundamental purpose, either as primarily working to improve pay, benefits and working conditions of their members, or as part of a larger project to mobilize members for social justice. That debate was especially salient for the Teamsters, which represents both public defenders and the other side of the justice system: law enforcement and corrections officers.
Ballots counted on Tuesday showed public defenders voted 156-153 to stay Teamsters, with two voting for no representation and more than 250 not voting at all.
“I am disappointed we very narrowly missed this chance to be part of a union that better reflects public defender values and spirit,” said Maggie Bott, an organizer for the independent union, United Defense Advocates of Minnesota, and a Hennepin County public defender.
She said they are evaluating whether they might have grounds to appeal.
Leaders for the United Defense Advocates of Minnesota promised a clean break from the political baggage of the International Teamsters along with lower dues and more zealous advocacy for the hundreds of public defenders who represent about 90% of people charged with crimes in Minnesota.
Bott, like many of her peers, have felt uneasy about being in a union that also represents law enforcement and corrections officers, whose political and policy goals are at times in opposition to public defenders, as with disclosure rules on police discipline.
“I respect their right to be unionized … I just don’t really want to be in the same union as them,” Bott said.
There are also deep ideological and cultural divides within the Teamsters nationally, one of the most diverse unions representing sanitation workers, truck drivers, probation officers and attorneys.
Those divisions have only grown with President Trump’s appeal to working-class voters. International Teamsters President Sean O’Brien was the first in history to address the Republican National Convention, and the international union declined to endorse a candidate for president in 2024, citing an internal poll showing 60% of their members supported Trump.
Like many locals, the Teamsters Local 320 endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Even so, some continue to be troubled by being part of a union they see as right-wing and anti-immigrant.
“I don’t want to give a hundred-some dollars a month to this organization,” Bott said.

Others say the divisions are a distraction from the one unifying force that transcends all their differences: money.
“Sean O’ Brien talking at the RNC was pretty gross. But it’s part of the games that they have to play at that level,” said Jessen Alexander, a public defender in Brainerd. “The Teamsters are there to get me a bigger paycheck. They’re there to get more money into my health insurance. And that’s what I want them for.”
Alexander’s sentiment is shared by numerous attorneys, largely in greater Minnesota, said Gus Froemke, recording secretary and communications director for Teamsters Local 320.
“We can be a social justice organization if that’s what you want us to do,” Froemke said. “But here’s where I run into issues. I’m talking to public defenders all over the state … and they’re not talking to me about Trump. They’re not talking to me about Sean O’ Brien. They’re talking to me about their pay and their benefits.”
Much of the conflict is also deeply personal and a clash of personalities between former union steward and Hennepin County public defender Bob Kolstad and Teamsters Local 320 Secretary-Treasurer Brian Aldes.
Neither Kolstad nor Aldes hides their contempt for the other. Kolstad, who worked directly for the union for a couple years, ran against Aldes for the principal position and lost three times.
“It rings to us of, if I can’t get what I want, then I’m going to take my marbles and go home,” Aldes said.
When union leaders and stewards learned that Kolstad was plotting a secession, they stripped him and another steward of their leadership roles.
The ancient feud between Kolstad and Aldes turned off some members of the union, who felt the entire, polarizing saga was just about two guys who can’t get along.
“It’s like being in a custody battle,” said Laurel O’Rouke, a public defender in Washington County who voted to stick with the union.
Kolstad and his allies say it’s not personal, that the union has a toxic culture and significant management deficiencies. On the money issue, Kolstad and supporters of the independent union blame the Teamsters for letting their compensation lag further and further behind prosecutors for decades.
Only recently did public defenders catch up to their peers on the other side of the courtroom, winning eye-popping raises at the Capitol in 2023 — $66,000, or 72%, for some attorneys. Supporters of the independent union said they succeeded despite the Teamsters — not because of the union — crediting the work of rank-and-file members and an unprecedented strike threat.
“It got to be pretty apparent that we were paying people to do work that we could do for ourselves much cheaper,” Kolstad said.
Kolstad says Teamster leaders aren’t transparent or knowledgeable about the union’s finances, and promised to save members hundreds of dollars a year in dues while also hiring their own lobbyist to focus entirely on their concerns.
But other public defenders give more credit to the Teamsters in helping them secure pay parity with prosecutors, saying it took lots of people rowing together as well as a DFL trifecta and a historic $18 billion surplus during the 2023 legislative session.
“We got the highest raises percentage-wise than anybody else in the state two years ago. Why on earth are we looking for a new union?” O’Rourke said.
Public defenders are back at the bargaining table this year with the state, but facing a much more sour economic outlook that could foreshadow cuts in future years. That uncertainty had some like Alexander even more worried about leaving an established union for a start-up.
They say they want a union with expertise in complex health insurance negotiations, a legal team to litigate disciplinary procedures, a well-connected lobbyist and a strike fund.
“I’m just trying to do what’s best for myself. And what’s best for me and my three kids is that we stay with an established union,” Alexander said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P1230338-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Tensions in the city remain high with daily protests after the Trump administration called in the National Guard and the Marines against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom and city leaders. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Donald Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles is “unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford and 17 other Democratic state attorneys general said in a statement Wednesday.
Democratic U.S. Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, as well as Democratic Reps. Dina Titus, Steven Horsford, and Susie Lee are also condemning Trump’s actions that have escalated conflict in Los Angeles. 
Ford criticized Trump’s decision to federalize and deploy California’s National Guard without the consent of California state leaders, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, saying the action would “sow chaos, inflame tensions and put people’s lives at risk — including those of our law enforcement officers.”
“The federal administration should be working with local leaders to keep everyone safe, not mobilizing the military against the American people,” Ford said in a statement. 
Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta sued Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the activation of the state’s National Guard without the coordination of state leadership, asking a court to declare the order unlawful.
“As the chief law enforcement officers of our states, we are proud to protect our communities and oppose violence in any form. We support Attorney General Bonta in his challenge to the Trump administration’s illegal conduct,” Ford continued. 
The statement was also joined by the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Arizona, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon and Vermont.
Protests began in downtown Los Angeles on Friday, June 6 after Immigration Customs Enforcement officers carried out raids in three locations across the city, where dozens of people were taken into custody. 
That evening the Los Angeles Police Department declared the protests an unlawful assembly, ordering demonstrators to leave the area. The department followed by breaking up protests using tear gas and rubber bullets, but protests continued throughout the weekend with reports of vandalism and burning self-driving cars. 
Trump responded on June 7 by deploying 2,000 California National Guard members to Los Angeles. After Newsom objected to Trump sending in the National Guard without his consent, Trump ordered an additional 700 Marines into the city.
In a statement, Rosen echoed Ford’s comments on the illegality of federalizing the National Guard as protest enforcement, calling it an “unnecessary escalation.”
“Calling up the National Guard without the consent of state officials is unprecedented in recent history, and sending active-duty military troops to go after Americans on U.S. soil is unconscionable and illegal,” Rosen said. 
The last time a president federalized the National Guard over the objection of a state governor was in 1967 when former President Lyndon B. Johnson deployed the National Guard during the Civil Rights Movement’s campaign in Alabama.
“This unnecessary escalation is just an attempt by the Administration to distract from Congressional Republicans’ extreme tax spending bill that’ll cut Medicaid and SNAP to give billionaires more tax giveaways,” Rosen said.
In a post on X, Cortez Masto said she supports “people’s right to make their voices heard” through “peaceful protests without violence or harming law enforcement.”
“The Trump administration should be working with local authorities to de-escalate the situation in Los Angeles, not inflaming it by sending in the National Guard without a request from state or local officials,” Cortez Masto continued. 
Over the weekend, Horsford also condemned the arrest of David Huerta, the 58-year-old president of Service Employees International Union California. Huerta was arrested Friday while protesting outside a business during an immigration enforcement operation. Huerta was injured during the arrest and was treated at a local hospital before being transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A.
Huerta “was illegally arrested and injured by ICE in CA. He remains in custody today. Illegal ICE raids are a danger to every community. We must speak out against actions like these,” Horsford wrote on X.
In response to the deployment of the National Guard, Titus wrote on X Monday that Trump’s “immigration policies are sowing chaos and division in our communities throughout the country. Federalizing the National Guard, mobilizing the Marines, and calling for the arrest of a Governor will escalate an already tense situation.”
Democratic Rep. Susie Lee on Wednesday night called Trump’s tactics in California “unprecedented and incredibly disturbing. Like Rosen, Lee said characterized Trump’s move as “a distraction from Republicans taking away food from hungry kids and seniors and health care from hundreds of thousands of Nevadans and millions of Americans so they can give the wealthiest Americans massive tax breaks. All while adding $2.8 trillion to the debt.
“And, in the meantime, they choose to traumatize legal citizens and make our communities less safe,” Lee said.
On Tuesday Nevada State Democratic Party Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno released a statement calling the decision to deploy California’s National Guard “unlawful,” adding that state and local leaders’ authority should “not be subverted by the federal government” through “federal interference and intimidation.”
Monroe-Moreno also called on protests to “remain peaceful” and condemned “violence of any kind.” 
“Donald Trump’s move to federalize California’s National Guard and deploy thousands of its members without consulting with the state’s governor is a gross and unlawful abuse of power. This unnecessary move is a distraction from his price-raising agenda that eliminates the Department of Education, cuts Medicaid and SNAP benefits, and slashes affordable housing programs — all to give tax cuts to billionaires,” she said.

,California,2025-06-12 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom wanted to fast-track the Delta tunnel project. The Legislature slowed the flow,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/06/delta-tunnel-newsom-california/,Gov. Gavin Newsom’s fellow Democrats in the Legislature usually let him use the budget process to push his priority bills and minimize debate. Not this time.,"Repeatedly Gavin Newsom has sought legislative approval of his high-priority policy proposals within the annual state budget process, even though they often have nothing to do with the budget.
The unique rules governing the budget and its accompanying “trailer bills” allow them to be enacted quickly, bypassing many parliamentary hurdles and vote thresholds that other legislation must endure.
The Legislature, controlled by Newsom’s fellow Democrats, generally allows him to use the budget process, in part because legislators often employ the same shortcuts for their own priorities.
Their underlying motive for the sneaky use — or misuse — of the budget process is to avoid prolonged analysis and debate that might, if the bills’ contents are fully vetted, make them more difficult to enact. The trailer bills often contain favors for interest groups that would be difficult to justify in a more transparent process.
Last month, while unveiling a revised state budget, Newsom asked the Legislature to attach legislation that would fast-track the highly controversial project to move Sacramento River water to the California Aqueduct without it flowing through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta — renewing a tactic that failed two years go.
First proposed as a “peripheral canal” more than a half-century ago, it morphed into twin tunnels and, after Newsom’s election, a single tunnel. Its purpose has also evolved, from a mechanism to increase water deliveries to Southern California, to one that would, Newsom and others argue, improve the reliability of deliveries.
“For too long, attempts to modernize our critical water infrastructure have stalled in endless red tape, burdened with unnecessary delay,” Newsom said. “We’re done with barriers. Our state needs to complete this project as soon as possible, so that we can better store and manage water to prepare for a hotter, drier future. Let’s get this built.”
It would take a book —a big book — to fully explain all of the project’s environmental, financial and political aspects. Briefly, however, while advocates say that isolating water conveyance from the Delta would improve habitat for fish and other wildlife, opponents contend that less water flowing through the estuary would further degrade its water quality.
While Newsom and other supporters often depict the tunnel as a stand-alone project, it is inexorably related to other aspects of California’s very complex water picture.
For instance, as it touts a tunnel that would doubtless reduce Delta flows, the state also is pressuring farmers to reduce diversions from the San Joaquin River and its tributaries, to increase flows through the Delta. Those two efforts are not officially linked, but the connection is obvious.
The long-stalled Delta Conveyance Project — the latest of several official names — has slowly approached the final pre-construction phase, which is why Newsom wanted a trailer bill to finally get a green light.
However, his proposal immediately rekindled the political jousting between advocates and opponents and the pressure on legislative leaders over whether the tunnel should be addressed in a trailer bill.
This week the Legislature punted, its members clearly leery about taking on such a high-profile and infinitely controversial issue through the budget process, especially since Democratic legislators are very divided, roughly along north-south geographic lines.
With the budget process now off limits, the warring factions may duke it out through the normal legislative process, although there is a theory in some circles that the Department of Water Resources could proceed because the State Water Project was approved by voters 65 years ago.
The Legislature specifically approved the project as a canal more than 40 years ago, but its opponents challenged it in a 1982 referendum and won.
This could be, as the inimitable Yogi Berra once observed, “déjà vu all over again.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/052024_Delta_LE_CM_33.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Mendelsohn, regarding a lawsuit he filed against Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, for wrongful termination. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Former Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs Commissioner Kent Davis filed a civil lawsuit against Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday, alleging his firing in October violated his free speech and due process rights.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, also accused Ivey of wrongful termination, defamation and intentional interference with business relations because he has been unable to find other employment since getting terminated.
“I think anybody who reads through that complaint will see a pattern and practice of behavior there that I think we will go more into as we get into the facts of this case,” Davis said. “Hopefully we will get to discovery, and there is going to be more that comes out in this case.”
Ivey’s office said in a statement Wednesday that they were “extremely confident that Governor Ivey’s necessary actions will stand any court test there may be.”
The lawsuit is the latest clash that dates back to September, when Ivey accused Davis of mishandling grant funds from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and filing what she characterized as a frivolous ethics complaint with the Alabama Ethics Commission that was later dismissed.
Davis initially agreed to leave the position at the end of 2024, but later that month the State Board of Veterans Affairs asked him to withdraw that resignation, saying it found no evidence of wrongdoing. Ivey then moved to fire Davis, accusing him of manipulating the board.
Davis and his attorneys argue that Ivey lacked the legal authority to fire Davis.
“The law was pretty clear that he was hired by the State Board of Veterans Affairs and could only be terminated by the State Board of Veterans Affairs, and only for cause,” said Kenneth Mendelsohn, an attorney representing Davis, on Wednesday. “Initially, she tried to fire him without even going to the board, which certainly violated due process rights he had. And then she called a special meeting later to try and get the board to fire him, and they voted not to.”
Ivey signed a bill in March removing most of the board’s powers and reducing it to an advisory role within the governor’s office.
The Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs received $5 million from ARPA in June 2023 and an additional $2 million from the Alabama Department of Finance.
The governor’s office last year accused Davis of not presenting grant applications for mental health applications funded through ARPA until January, just months before a June 1 deadline. Ivey said that raised questions from other department heads about compliance and proper fund use.
The Alabama Department of Mental Health terminated a contract with Veterans’ Affairs in part due to these concerns. The Alabama Department of Finance later contacted Veterans Affairs with concerns about the grants, some of which the department said had little to no connection with veterans’ mental health.
Davis’ lawsuit argues that Ivey’s accusation that Davis mishandled ARPA funds “was false and Ivey knew or at least should have known it was false.”
“In fact, all funds were preserved and returned to the Department of Finance and, as a result of Davis’s efforts, the grant program was successful without using any grant funds,” the lawsuit said.
According to the lawsuit, Davis decided to return the $7 million the agency received from ARPA to the Alabama Department of Finance. However, Davis wanted to continue with the grant program to allow organizations who were due to receive funding to continue to serve the mental health needs of veterans, according to the lawsuit.
“Simultaneous to Davis’s efforts to salvage the grant process for veterans’ mental health programs, the Alabama Department of Finance was investigating and responding to Commissioner Boswell’s allegations regarding the ARPA funds,” the lawsuit states.
According to the lawsuit, Davis filed an ethics complaint against Boswell last July, alleging that members of the State Board of Veterans Affairs had brought concerns about the ARPA grant program and other veterans issues.
The Ethics Commission dismissed the ethics complaint in August. Ivey called the complaint frivolous.
Davis is seeking monetary relief stemming from his termination and for retirement benefits he is due.
“When I look back, every step that I and my colleagues in the Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs do was by the book, in accordance with the law,” Davis said on Wednesday. “And sometimes we were obligated by the law to take those steps. There is the old adage, ‘No good deed goes unpunished.’ Is that the point we have in this country, you follow the law, you do what you are obligated to do under the law, and you are punished as a result of it, you are retaliated against as a result of it? Maybe that is the point where we are in this country.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250611_150102-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

“We see it as our mission to make sure that whatever happens at the federal level with the federal dollars, we can manage a soft landing, and we are in a position to do that,” ACCS Chancellor Jimmy Baker said at the monthly meeting of the ACCS Board of Trustees Wednesday morning. “I don’t like the idea that just because some legislation passes, we have to jump and threaten people with their jobs and those kinds of things.”

The Pell Grant is given to students based on their expected family contribution, among other academic factors, and often goes to students with “exceptional financial need,” according to the Federal Student Aid Office. According to ACCS, its students receive an average of $4,300 in Pell Grants every year, about $500 less than the median ACCS yearly tuition.
“These would lead to some significant changes for our system, but we want our board to know that we are watching this closely, and we will see how this will play out,” Vice Chancellor of Student Success Neil Scott said. “But we are already putting contingency plans in place for the areas that may impact our colleges.”
Baker said he did not expect things to be “pleasant.”
“It’s not going to be easy. But I see the move with the federal dollars in education diminishing,” Baker said. “So we have to adjust ourselves, and we can do a lot of that. We’re going to do a lot of that because our ultimate mission is offering quality programs to the communities that we serve.”
Despite threats to federal financial aid, Scott announced Wednesday that enrollment for the Fall 2025 semester is up 29.36% over Fall 2024, or 7,976 more students than last year. Scott said that brings the total enrollment to-date to 35,143 across the system’s 24 colleges.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.

Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.
“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
 Ripple effects

Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
 State action

Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-12 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA moves to repeal rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from US power plants,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/12/epa-greenhouse-gas-mercury-power-plant-rules/,The EPA proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas, an action that Administrator Lee Zeldin said would remove billions of dollars in costs for industry and help “unleash” American energy.
The EPA also proposed weakening a regulation that requires power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic pollutants that can harm brain development of young children and contribute to heart attacks and other health problems in adults.
The rollbacks are meant to fulfill Republican President Donald Trump’s repeated pledge to “unleash American energy” and make it more affordable for Americans to power their homes and operate businesses.
If approved and made final, the plans would reverse efforts by Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration to address climate change and improve conditions in areas heavily burdened by industrial pollution, mostly in low-income and majority Black or Hispanic communities.
The power plant rules are among about 30 environmental regulations that Zeldin targeted in March when he announced what he called the “most consequential day of deregulation in American history.”
Zeldin said Wednesday the new rules would help end what he called the Biden and Obama administration’s “war on so much of our U.S. domestic energy supply.”
“The American public spoke loudly and clearly last November,” he added in a speech at EPA headquarters. “They wanted to make sure that … no matter what agency anybody might be confirmed to lead, we are finding opportunities to pursue common-sense, pragmatic solutions that will help reduce the cost of living … create jobs and usher in a golden era of American prosperity.”
Environmental and public health groups called the rollbacks dangerous and vowed to challenge the rules in court.
Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate & Health, called the proposals “yet another in a series of attacks” by the Trump administration on the nation’s “health, our children, our climate and the basic idea of clean air and water.”
She called it “unconscionable to think that our country would move backwards on something as common sense as protecting children from mercury and our planet from worsening hurricanes, wildfires, floods and poor air quality driven by climate change.”
“Ignoring the immense harm to public health from power plant pollution is a clear violation of the law,” added Manish Bapna, president and CEO of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “If EPA finalizes a slapdash effort to repeal those rules, we’ll see them in court.”
The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency’s own prior assessments and a wide range of other research.
It’s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated — they can’t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.
Even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead — and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems, the AP analysis found. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth’s warming to deadlier levels.
Biden, a Democrat, had made fighting climate change a hallmark of his presidency. Coal-fired power plants would be forced to capture smokestack emissions or shut down under a strict EPA rule issued last year. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the power plant rules would reduce pollution and improve public health while supporting a reliable, long-term supply of electricity.

The power sector is the nation’s second-largest contributor to climate change, after transportation.
In its proposed regulation, the Trump EPA argues that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-fired power plants “do not contribute significantly to dangerous pollution” or climate change and therefore do not meet a threshold under the Clean Air Act for regulatory action. Greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas-fired plants “are a small and decreasing part of global emissions,” the EPA said, adding: “this Administration’s priority is to promote the public health or welfare through energy dominance and independence secured by using fossil fuels to generate power.”
The Clean Air Act allows the EPA to limit emissions from power plants and other industrial sources if those emissions significantly contribute to air pollution that endangers public health.
If fossil fuel plants no longer meet the EPA’s threshold, the Trump administration may later argue that other pollutants from other industrial sectors don’t either and therefore shouldn’t be regulated, said Meghan Greenfield, a former EPA and Justice Department lawyer now in private practice.
The EPA proposal “has the potential to have much, much broader implications,” she said.
Zeldin, a former New York congressman, said the Biden-era rules were designed to “suffocate our economy in order to protect the environment,” with the intent to regulate the coal industry “out of existence” and make it “disappear.”
National Mining Association president and CEO Rich Nolan applauded the new rules, saying they remove “deliberately unattainable standards” for clean air while “leveling the playing field for reliable power sources, instead of stacking the deck against them.”
But Dr. Howard Frumkin, a former director of the National Center for Environmental Health and professor emeritus at the University of Washington School of Public Health, said Zeldin and Trump were trying to deny reality.
“The world is round, the sun rises in the east, coal-and gas-fired power plants contribute significantly to climate change, and climate change increases the risk of heat waves, catastrophic storms and many other health threats,” Frumkin said. “These are indisputable facts. If you torpedo regulations on power plant greenhouse gas emissions, you torpedo the health and well-being of the American public and contribute to leaving a world of risk and suffering to our children and grandchildren.”
A paper published earlier this year in the journal Science found the Biden-era rules could reduce U.S. power sector carbon emissions by 73% to 86% below 2005 levels by 2040, compared with a reduction of 60% to 83% without the rules.
“Carbon emissions in the power sector drop at a faster rate with the (Biden-era) rules in place than without them,” said Aaron Bergman, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research institution and a co-author of the Science paper. The Biden rule also would result in “significant reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, pollutants that harm human health,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dims.apnews-1-1-1024x683.webp,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Patricia M Sears: Why the Northeast Kingdom needs Living Waters Hospice House.","Dear Editor,


Here in Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, we’re known for rolling up our sleeves, pitching in for neighbors and showing up when it matters most.
And yet, when it comes to caring for each other at the very end of life, we’re missing something essential.
We have no hospice-specific home in Orleans or Essex Counties — a place designed solely for people in their final days who can’t stay at home, whether due to lack of a caregiver, housing insecurity or the limitations of illness.
That’s why Living Waters Hospice House matters so deeply.
It will be the very first of its kind in our region: a peaceful, home-like space with trained caregivers and volunteers who provide around-the-clock support. Living Waters Hospice House won’t feel clinical or cold. It will feel like home — with two private rooms to start and the potential to grow as our community’s needs grow.
Local VNA hospice professionals will continue providing expert medical care, while Living Waters staff and volunteers offer the presence, comfort and humanity that make all the difference at life’s end.
Living Waters Hospice House is for people like the aging farmer who has outlived his family. It is for the elderly couple who are too frail to care for each other. 
Living Waters Hospice House is for the adult daughter working two jobs who wants the best for her mom but can’t be at her side 24/7. 
And building Living Waters Hospice House is for all of us who believe no one should face death alone, afraid, or in pain.
Living Waters Hospice House is how we show up — for our neighbors, our elders and, ultimately, for ourselves. It’s a promise that even at the end, compassion will lead the way.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero)Mike Yestramski has enjoyed a low profile through much of his six years leading Washington state’s largest public sector union.
Not anymore. His very public clashes with the governor during a contentious 2025 legislative session put a political spotlight on the president of the Washington Federation of State Employees. The union represents 54,000 state government, higher education and public service workers.
Ferguson and Democratic state senators — longtime union allies — wanted to furlough workers and make them pay more for health care coverage. They also called for curtailing programs and closing Rainier School, a rehabilitation center in Pierce County for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, moves certain to trigger layoffs.
Yestramski and legions of fellow union members turned out in force to oppose these moves. Clad in the union’s green t-shirts, they rallied on the Capitol steps, demonstrated at the governor’s office and patrolled the hallways outside the House and Senate chambers to pigeonhole lawmakers through the final hours of session.
The muscular, pony-tailed labor leader was ubiquitous, rebellious and, in the end, victorious in some of the most pitched political battles of the session. 
And he didn’t hold back with rhetorical slights against the new governor, calling Ferguson a “pseudo Democrat” at rallies and “Ratfink Robbie Ferguson” on Facebook. The swipes further brightened the exposure of the union’s demands.
Yestramski said in a recent interview in the union’s Olympia headquarters that he prefers “adult conversations” to resolve differences, though he realizes what occurred in the legislative session “may have painted a slightly different impression.” But the gravity of the situation demanded a strong retort, he said.
“I generally believe that collaboration tends to be more successful than aggression,” he said. “But that takes all of the parties involved to do that.” 
Yestramski, 45, was elected to a two-year term as federation president in 2019. Then 39, Yestramski said he was reportedly the federation’s youngest ever president.  Yestramski was reelected in 2021 and 2023. He plans to seek a fourth term this fall.
He started his public service career as a homeless outreach social worker in Baltimore. He came to Washington in 2013, taking a job as a psychiatric social worker at Western State Hospital. An active union member, Yestramski said he pursued the leadership post because he was “just getting really sick of seeing my friends and co-workers getting beat up, really, really bad.” 
“People ended up in ICUs. People lost digits,” he said. Jobs at the hospital can still be dangerous, but Yestramski credited CEO Charlie Southerland for working collaboratively with the union to come up with solutions to bolster worker safety.
The following interview was lightly edited for clarity and length.
Have you had a chance to chat with or meet face-to-face with the governor?
I have not.
You’ve called him a few names. How do you feel about him now?
While his rhetoric during the session I didn’t love, he did ultimately sign the budget that funds our contracts and did not contain furloughs. As far as what he actually did, he didn’t harm us, which was the fear based on statements that were coming out. For that, I’m thankful. 
You did say you felt scammed and that workers were lied to because Ferguson’s proposals didn’t align with his pledges to labor leaders in the 2024 campaign. Do you think WFSE members now feel they can trust him to have their backs?

As a social worker — this is going to be related, I promise — the therapeutic school that I was brought up in was behaviorism. One of its basic tenets is, “I don’t really care what your motivations are, as long as you do the right thing.” To that end, whether it was genuinely in his heart or whether it was due to the political pressure of our members, whatever reason it was that got that outcome, the outcome is what was important.
As far as our members trusting him, obviously, folks are going to be a little bit hesitant. This isn’t just the governor. This is any elected official where we have to continue to make it known that we’re paying attention, that we’ll show up and that we have expectations of our elected officials. When we do that in large enough crowds, they listen and they do the right thing.
In the end, did Ferguson do the right thing enough to secure the union’s backing for reelection?
That’s three-and-a-half years away. In sports terms, there’s going to be a lot more game film to review by the time that decision comes up.
Enough time for a reconciliation?
As far as he and I, personally, I can’t say. My door is always open, even if it’s to say I don’t like you, right? I don’t care if it’s me. I believe the narrative got a little bit into a personal thing between me and Bob. I need to know that there are people in the governor’s office that he will listen to, who can make sure that our main issues are being heard and addressed.
Do you feel that way today?
I feel that now more than I did two months ago. Would I like to have a better relationship with the governor? I don’t want to be in a feud with our governor.
You’re probably not going to call him a “ratfink” again.
Probably not.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1187-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Robert L. Walsh: The governor should let the Legislature adjourn.","Dear Editor, 


On June 9, 2025, I attended a public meeting of the South Burlington senators and representatives. Attendance was moderate.
Although a variety of subjects were discussed, the governor’s proposed education bill attracted the most discussion. By the end of the evening, it was apparent that, although much has been accomplished, there are still many thorny subjects remaining to be solved. One example is the governor’s proposal to expand school choice. 
Recently, I have read in the local media that the governor is pressing for the Legislature to approve an education bill prior to adjourning. If not, he has stated he will call for a special session. I hope he will reconsider this position. 
I clearly remember the chaos surrounding the final days of the legislative sessions when I was a member. The rush to get things done ensures that bad or incomplete legislation is passed. 
Education reform is the most important subject under discussion. It requires time to be done correctly.
I hope the governor will allow the House and Senate to adjourn and use the adjournment time to complete whatever studies are required. When the Legislature is called to order next January, it should be ready to present an appropriate bill for the governor to sign.

Gov. JB Pritzker will tell a congressional committee Thursday that America’s immigration problems are a result of a bipartisan failure to reform the country’s immigration system and secure the country’s borders.

In more than five pages of written testimony submitted by the governor to the U.S. House Oversight Committee ahead of hours of questions from lawmakers, Pritzker detailed how Illinois responded to the migrant crisis and the rationale for Illinois’ “sanctuary state” law.

“We can have a secure border while also having real immigration pathways that allow people to come here, work, and support themselves on a reasonable timeline,” Pritzker wrote. “Our prosperity and our national security demand it.”

Pritzker was summoned to Washington, D.C. alongside fellow Democratic Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Kathy Hochul of New York at the behest of congressional Republicans seeking answers about sanctuary state polices.

“The governors of these states must explain why they are prioritizing the protection of criminal illegal aliens over the safety of U.S. citizens, and they must be held accountable,” committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky, said in a statement earlier this year.

Pritzker’s appearance before the committee follows Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who detailed Chicago’s Welcoming City ordinance to the legislative panel in March. It also comes after days of protests, including in Chicago, over President Donald Trump’s administration’s tactics for arresting and deporting noncitizens.

At the center of Thursday’s hearing is Illinois’ TRUST Act – the 2017 law signed by Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner that prohibits Illinois law enforcement from detaining a person based solely on their immigration status. Pritzker wrote in his testimony that this law does not interfere with federal immigration laws.

“Illinois follows federal and state laws and will continue to do so,” Pritzker wrote. “We expect the federal government to do the same. Federal officials should operate in Illinois, as they do in every state, to enforce federal immigration policy, but we will not divert our limited resources and officers to do the job of the federal government when it is not in the best interest of our state.”

However, Pritzker reiterated, as he has publicly in Illinois several times since November’s election, that he supports deporting violent people who are in the U.S. without legal permission. He clarified that there are situations where Illinois law enforcement can assist federal immigration authorities.

“When the federal government has a judge-signed warrant for a criminal’s arrest, we work to assist them, regardless of that criminal’s immigration status,” Pritzker wrote.

The governor wrote Illinois’ TRUST Act is an important tool to foster a trusting relationship between immigrants living here illegally and police that pays off in solving crimes.

Pritzker’s written testimony also sought to push back on allegations that sanctuary polices have made Chicago and Illinois more dangerous. The governor detailed his administration’s investments in policing and gun violence prevention, particularly as Illinois dealt with an influx of migrants.

Illinois saw more than 50,000 asylum seekers and other migrants arrive in the state beginning in August 2022, Pritzker wrote, mostly via transportation provided by Texas. Migrant arrivals in Illinois subsided in early 2024, but during that time, Pritzker often begged President Joe Biden’s administration to step up efforts for immigration reform and quell the influx of migrants into Texas.

The arrivals put an “unprecedented strain” on the state, Pritzker wrote. The state, Chicago and Cook County spent hundreds of millions of dollars in response to the influx.

“Illinois filled in the gaps where federal immigration policy failed, ensuring that people were not starving on our streets as they were processed through our broken immigration system, sought asylum, applied for other forms of immigration relief, or went through removal proceedings,” Pritzker said.

Migrants without housing are now in Chicago’s homeless shelters as the surge of arrivals has subsided, Pritzker wrote. However, Illinois is still set to spend $40 million on Welcoming Centers in fiscal year 2026, according to the budget awaiting Pritzker’s signature.

Though he wrote “both sides are to blame” for the nation’s immigration issues, Pritzker wrote “some border state governors and mayors” chose to “treat people as pawns.” Pritzker and Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott frequently butted heads during the migrant surge.

Pritzker wrote he hopes the hearing “will be a productive step towards much needed bipartisan reforms.”

But the hearing could also involve political fireworks. Pritzker has been one of the most outspoken Democrats against Trump, even invoking comparisons to Nazi Germany during his February State of the State address. He’s also believed to be interested in inheriting the White House from Trump.

Trump’s administration has fired back and criticized Illinois’ immigration laws. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Springfield last month to bash Pritzker on immigration.

Pritzker will face some of Congress’ most outspoken personalities on both sides of the aisle who have been assigned to the committee, including Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Texas Democrat Rep. Jasmine Crockett.

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Schaumburg Democrat, is also on the committee. Krishnamoorthi is running for Illinois’ open U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin.  Pritzker endorsed Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton in the primary race.

(Photo by Tom Banse)Teachers and staff in low-lying schools along the Pacific Northwest coast face an unusual extra responsibility alongside educators’ usual duties: can they herd the entire student body to higher ground on foot in 20 minutes or less to escape a tsunami?
It’s a daunting challenge with the highest possible stakes should an offshore earthquake unleash a wall of incoming seawater. The last megathrust earthquake to hit the region was in 1700, and the Northwest is now in the window for the next magnitude 9.0+ Cascadia fault quake and tsunami.
“It’s something that’s always on your mind. You try not to let this take over,” said North Beach School District Superintendent Richard Zimmerman.
The Washington Legislature allocated $151.5 million in the recently passed state construction budget to relocate three coastal schools out of the tsunami zone and build a refuge tower at a fourth. Zimmerman’s district is one of the beneficiaries, along with the Taholah and Cape Flattery school districts.
“We’re anxious to get this done because the lives of our students, staff and community might very well depend on it,” Zimmerman said in an interview from Ocean Shores.
The Legislature giveth and taketh away
In 2022, the Washington Legislature got serious about the hundreds of older, unreinforced public schools at risk of collapse in a major earthquake. Lawmakers allocated $100 million to a revamped School Seismic Safety Grant Program overseen by the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. In 2023, the Legislature chipped in another $40 million. 
But now comes an unexpected twist. This spring, the Legislature took back more than half of that initial sum — $80 million — because it was unspent. OSPI Director of School Facilities Randy Newman said money was left in the bank toward the end of the budget cycle because many of the prioritized seismic retrofits and school relocations were still in the design phase. The state schools superintendent asked to carry over the unspent balance into the next budget along with the new allocation, but lawmakers chose not to.
“The reality of trying to find the right locations, negotiating the contracts, doing the engineering has taken more time,” noted state Rep. Steve Tharinger, D-Port Townsend, the chair of the House Capital Budget Committee. “It’s taken us a while to build momentum.”
Tharinger said the Legislature’s budget writers decided to be more prescriptive in the newly signed state budget by steering specific sums to projects ready to go in the most vulnerable coastal school districts. Hence, the green light to break ground in Ocean Shores, Taholah and Neah Bay.
Overall, the seismic safety program was renewed at a lower level than the state superintendent asked for in light of many other competing priorities for state construction dollars.
“It’s pretty exciting to have avoided a tragedy and to be able to start building schools in safer places,” Tharinger said.
From his perch in the state superintendent’s office, Newman wishes the Legislature had funded additional school seismic projects in the new budget. Since 2021, he’s seen state-funded earthquake retrofits through to completion in Centralia, South Bend, Boistfort and Marysville — with Cosmopolis Elementary on deck to receive seismic strengthening this summer.
“We were happy with the funding level we received from the Legislature,” to now lift the highest priority schools out of the tsunami zone, Newman said in an interview last week.
Placed on standby pending future funding were multiple projects in Hoquiam, Aberdeen and the Long Beach peninsula, including seismic retrofits and elementary school consolidations and relocations. Also on the state’s future priority list is a rooftop tsunami refuge atop a seismically-strengthened North Beach Junior/Senior High School in Ocean Shores.
Washington state has long lagged behind neighboring West Coast states and provinces in addressing earthquake risk in school buildings. The Oregon Legislature, way back in 2005, created a school seismic retrofit grant program on the scale now underway from Olympia. The provincial government of British Columbia started a seismic mitigation program for schools in 2004 and has shelled out more than $1.9 billion since then.

Moving to higher ground… or climbing tower stairs
The relocation of the Taholah K-12 public school is part of a larger, years-long process led by the Quinault Nation to move much of the lower village of Taholah about three-quarters of a mile uphill, out of danger from increasingly common floods, storm surges and a future tsunami. The new school will eventually be surrounded by neighborhoods, parks and ballfields to be built on freshly-cleared forestland.
Taholah Superintendent Herman Lartigue Jr. said he hopes to welcome roughly 200 students to their new quake-ready school in 2027. He said the use of cedar planking on the outside of the school and exposed cedar beams and columns inside — as well as installations of tribal art — would give the building a distinctive appearance.
“This building is going to be indicative of the culture. It’s great,” Lartigue said.
The Cape Flattery School District is making a parallel push to incorporate tribal culture in the new Neah Bay K-12 campus, which will replace an elementary school and secondary school at sea level on the Makah reservation. The groundbreaking is tentatively scheduled for mid-July, with move-in anticipated in mid-2027.
The Makah Nation donated a long-term lease on a hillside parcel about one mile inland from Neah Bay to build the new school with a capacity for about 600 students. District Superintendent Michelle Parkin said she harbored a lot of concern last winter upon reading about the budget shortfalls the 2025 Legislature had to grapple with.
“It’s such a relief,” the school relocation funding came through, Parkin said. “Our children are going to be safe.”
Some unusual features of the new Neah Bay school she mentioned include a fish hatchery on campus, carving and canoe making areas in the shop class space, and outdoor fire pits where students can learn to kipper salmon.

In Grays Harbor County, the $8.2 million budgeted by the Legislature to relocate Pacific Beach Elementary covers land acquisition and conceptual design, but isn’t enough to construct a new school on higher ground. The existing school, which enrolls around 100 students, was built within earshot of the Pacific surf in 1956, long before modern seismic codes existed.
Moving the North Beach district’s other primary school out of harm’s way is virtually impossible because there is no suitable high ground nearby on the long and flat Ocean Shores peninsula. The solution the Legislature blessed with $8.2 million is to build a tsunami evacuation tower next to Ocean Shores Elementary. 
This robust steel tower will have a platform on top with a minimum capacity of 300 people to host the entire student body and staff. Modeling done for the city of Ocean Shores in connection with another tsunami tower proposal said the refuge platform should be about 50 feet high to be comfortably above the surging waves.
Earthquake risk mitigation can also be done with local funding, which is how larger and wealthier Washington school districts have replaced or modernized the majority of their buildings to withstand strong shaking. But small and rural districts with limited tax bases and tax-averse voters usually have trouble with that approach.
Waiting years in line for state grant funding for seismic upgrades is a gamble, but there’s a financial incentive for districts: taxpayers statewide foot the bill for at least two-thirds — if not close to 100% — of the school reconstruction costs.
“We know that districts have struggled to pass local bonds and levies to modernize their school facilities,” Newman said. “It’s a big lift to address all the seismic needs of aging school buildings.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/tsunami-sign-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Hoosiers could be prohibited from purchasing soda and candy with their food benefits as early as January, but researchers and retailers question the effectiveness of the move — noting how difficult it could be to implement. 
Teas and other, non-milk based beverages may be out but candy bars with flour — like Twix or Butterfingers — are fine, a confusing distinction for clerks and cashiers to explain.
Last month, the federal government approved the state’s application to exclude the treats based on loose definitions added to Indiana’s code more than two decades ago. Gov. Mike Braun and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith are fans — and so is U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
But Joe Lackey, president of the Indiana Grocery and Convenience Store Association, said the decision came without much warning for the retailers responsible for face-to-face communication with the consumers enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program.
“The day after they held the press conference and announced they were doing it, they asked the industry to come to a meeting to talk about it and we basically said, ‘This meeting should have happened a couple of days ago before you made the decision,’” said Lackey, a longtime lobbyist. 
“I think it’s probably the end of the program (nationwide). I think food stamps and SNAP are going to just go away,” Lackey continued. “That was the intent, I think, to start with in Washington.”
He said SNAP retailers near the border will be hit hardest by the change, since benefits apply across state lines. Indiana cannot restrict what a SNAP enrollee purchases in neighboring states.
The approved waiver has an explicit goal to help “low-income households … obtain a more nutritious diet” to combat the nationwide “health epidemic further induced by diet-related chronic disease.”
But even that impact is far less clear for the 610,000 Hoosier enrollees. 
  Indiana University Professor Emeritus Dan Knudsen (From IU)
“I think, as a person who tends to think about these things from more of an economic point of view, it’s probably just going to shift (SNAP expenses to) other places,” said Dan Knudsen, a professor emeritus of geography at Indiana University and part of the IU Food Institute. 
Knudsen approaches food benefits from a mathematical perspective, analyzing the pros and cons of the Thrifty Food Plan used to calculate benefit allocations under SNAP. He noted that many beneficiaries might not have regular access to refrigeration, a stove or transportation — limiting their food options to whatever’s accessible and shelf stable. 
“Our current read from our most recent literature would indicate that SNAP benefits, right now, given the rise in food costs, are getting people through somewhere between 15 and 21 days of the month,” said Knudsen. “And then you need to take into account the fact that somewhere in the neighborhood of 50-60% of the SNAP benefit is typically utilized in a single purchase.”
SNAP enrollees already can’t purchase alcoholic beverages, tobacco or hot/prepared foods under federal rules.
 More about the waiver

Indiana’s soda and candy exemption waiver was signed the same day as Iowa’s, the latter of which includes snacks in addition to candy. Both came just a few days after Nebraska’s approved move to ban soda and energy drinks from SNAP purchases.
But their definitions, though overlapping, are distinct from Indiana’s. For example, Nebraska’s definition of soft drinks is more narrow and focuses on carbonation, but specifies that sports drinks like Gatorade are not included. 
On Tuesday, Braun went to Washington D.C. as part of a press conference at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, for a ceremonial signing to exempt certain foods in Arkansas, Idaho and Utah. 
All are part of a growing number of state leaders seeking to limit food benefits, including lawmakers in at least a dozen states that explored legislative options earlier this year. The federal government pays for the program’s benefits, only shuffling some administrative costs to states, and must approve any changes to SNAP. 
Lackey pointed to a pair of failed bills earlier this year as evidence of a lack of  widespread support, saying he and a coalition of anti-poverty advocates alongside industry lobbyists opposed the legislative efforts. 










Indiana is proud to be a leader in the Make America Healthy Again initiative, and I'm proud to join Secretary (Brooke) Rollins, Secretary Kennedy, Congressman (Jim) Baird, and my fellow Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders today to discuss returning SNAP to its proper purpose of nutrition, and how my Make Indiana Healthy Again agenda supports Indiana agriculture and empowers Hoosiers to live longer, healthier lives.


– Gov. Mike Braun, speaking at a June 10 press conference in Washington D.C.


“I don’t know anyone in Indiana — except for the governor — that’s for it,” said Lackey. 
Indiana’s waiver bans soft drinks, which defined in Indiana code are “nonalcoholic beverages that contain natural or artificial sweeteners. The term does not include beverages that contain milk or milk products, soy, rice, or similar milk substitutes, or greater than fifty percent (50%) of vegetable or fruit juice by volume.” 
Candy is defined as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners in combination with chocolate, fruits, nuts, or other ingredients or flavorings in the form of bars, drops, or pieces. The term does not include any preparation containing flour or requiring refrigeration.”
The loose definition of these terms appears to ban popular items like bottled teas and granola bars from purchase. Yet candy bars with flour, such as Kit Kats, and sugary bakery items are fine.
The state is required to notify beneficiaries and will even provide informative posters to retailers, retailers will have to reprogram their computers to align with the new rules. And clerks and cashiers will likely be the ones telling SNAP enrollees. 
“They’re the ones that are going to have to try to explain to the customers why they can no longer buy soft drinks or why they can no longer buy a candy item,” Lackey said. “This is going to be a real problem and a lot of stores, major stores throughout the state, have said they’re seriously considering dropping (SNAP).”
Such purchases can make up 20% of a convenience store’s sales, Lackey said. The hit also comes on top of the state’s long-proposed cigarette tax increase, which Lackey said would also hurt his members.
 But will it help?

The waiver itself cites several studies concluding that SNAP enrollees consume more sugary drinks and snacks than their peers — and the consumption of both has been linked to higher rates of obesity and diabetes. 
A similar public health effort to improve health by increasing taxes on soda has split experts, with researchers at the University of California in Berkeley finding such moves decrease consumption in low-income neighborhoods while Tax Foundation analysts argue that reducing obesity and sugar intake requires a more complicated plan.
SNAP cost-sharing jeopardizes food assistance program

Knudsen pointed to many other sources of sugar in the typical American diet — including his personal favorite, bread, which some European countries classify as confections because of the high sugar content in American brands.
“Taxes on sugar and taxes on candy are just the tip of the iceberg of the sugar consumption of the average American,” he said. 
Instead, SNAP supporters point to programs that allow enrollees to “double up” on fruits and vegetables with their benefits card by offering a discounted rate on certain produce at participating farmers markets and stores. An Indiana University study on SNAP beneficiaries at farmers markets concluded that “economic incentives (like double bucks) are a critical means for enhancing access to local fresh fruits and vegetables by subsidizing further purchasing power for low-income individuals,” though transportation posed a big barrier for SNAP enrollees. 
However, Knudsen noted that such studies like the above — which was produced by a former student of his — also struggle to connect those efforts to long-term health goals.
And more change could be coming. Lackey said he’s heard that the state plans to exclude other foods from SNAP, adding to the burden on retailers.
“It’s grown to a point where they just can’t fund it anymore, which is pretty scary,” said Lackey. “But do it on a national basis; don’t do it on a restricted, state-by-state basis where you have inconsistency.”
Also on the horizon: work requirements for SNAP enrollees, which Knudsen called a “red herring” since many beneficiaries are children, disabled or retired seniors. 
“Why are we punishing the poor?” Knudsen asked. “… it’s really important that any changes to SNAP are thought about from the point of view of individuals who are on SNAP who are food insecure.”

(Photo via Florida State Parks)Hey kids, here’s a civics lesson for you. The Florida Senate and House of Representatives — or as they’re sometimes called, “Dumb and Dumber” — make a lot of headlines by passing dopey laws, but that’s not their real job.
Deleting mentions of climate change from state statutes? Not their job. Changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico after 500 years to the cheesy Gulf of ‘Murrica? Not their job. Supporting the wacko conspiracy theories about chemtrails? Not their job.
The one thing that IS their job, kids, is passing a budget for the state. Period.
They’re supposed to complete this job by the end of their annual two-month legislative session. This year, they failed, which qualifies them for inclusion on the satirical “You Had ONE Job” website. This is not considered a high honor.
They’re still working on it, they say. They hope to hold a vote on June 16. They’re racing the clock, because they have to finish by July 1. That’s the start of the next fiscal year. If they’re not done by then, state government may be forced to shut down.
Surprisingly, one of the budget items on which the two houses differ from the governor is parks.
“Florida’s renowned state parks would suffer under state House and Senate proposals for the 2025-26 state budget, supporters of the public lands said this week,” Politico reported last week.
I say “surprisingly,” because both the House and Senate just passed a bill to protect the parks from another dimwitted drive by Gov. Ron DeSantis to build golf courses there.
They passed this pro-park bill because they saw how immensely popular the parks are, and how immensely unpopular DeSantis’ efforts to “upgrade” the parks were.
Yet now they’re also cutting the parks’ throats. I know Oscar Wilde said consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative, but c’mon, folks. Do you really think our legislators have ever listened to Oscar Wilde about anything?
What’s even kookier is that they also voted to repeal a law that created a big source of funding for buying and preserving even more environmentally sensitive land. It’s a law they had passed unanimously and with great fanfare just a year before: the Seminole Gaming Compact.
The compact is still there, and the gambling is still going on. But now the money will go elsewhere.

Former state parks director Eric Draper told me he’d never seen anything like it.  First Florida politicians brag about securing millions for a popular cause, “and then one year later, they just reverse it. The whole thing is tossed out.”
I contacted the most environmentally minded legislator I know to see what she had to say about it. She was, in a word, upset (two words, one of them a verb starting with a P and the other one “off,” would also be appropriate).
“I don’t think they consider the things that are most valued by all Floridians,” said Rep. Lindsay Cross, an actual environmental scientist. “Honestly, it’s like nothing is sacred anymore.”
 Gambling for greenspace
The Seminole Tribe has the most remarkable turnaround story in Florida history. Before you ask, yes, I’m counting the time the Florida Marlins won the World Series and then finished dead last the following season.
The Seminoles fought three wars against the federal government and never waved a white flag. They became the only tribe that never surrendered to the U.S.
But the members spent decades barely scraping by, living in chickee huts and eking out a living selling roadside souvenirs and putting on alligator wrestling shows for the tourists. According to a 1913 report to Congress, gambling was “unknown among them.”
Not anymore.
The Seminoles were the first tribe in the nation to launch its own gambling operation in 1979, fighting off a legal challenge from the Broward County sheriff. Today, this tribe of about 4,300 controls six casinos in Florida and six more in other states, Canada, and the Dominican Republic, not to mention the Hard Rock hotel and restaurant chain with locations in 70 countries.

Thanks to a 2021 agreement with DeSantis and the Legislature, the Seminoles are now running the largest legal sports betting operation in the country.
Sure, calls to the gambling addiction helpline have doubled since their sports betting operation started. But hey, you can’t make an omelet without impoverishing a bunch of blue-collar workers who don’t have money to lose, can you?
But what would happen to the state’s share of this gambling bonanza? Last year, at the urging of Senate President Kathleen Passidomo, the Legislature passed a bill decreeing that hundreds of millions of dollars from sports betting would be spent on land acquisition, preserving wildlife, and protecting waterways.
Gambling for greenspace! See how wholesome it is? Why, the amount was enough to make some environmental advocates start singing along with Marlon Brando, “Luck be a lady tonight!”
The money was desperately needed, especially for the Florida Wildlife Corridor. “To truly keep pace, Florida needs at least $500 million a year to permanently connect and protect the Florida Wildlife Corridor,” corridor foundation CEO Mallory Dimmitt told me.

The money wasn’t just for the parks and the corridor, but for water quality improvements too, noted Ryan Smart, executive director of the Florida Springs Council.
Yet now the Legislature wants to repeal that supposedly worthwhile investment. What were they thinking?
Or maybe the better question is: Were they thinking?
 Never seen a conference like this
  Senate President Ben Albritton via his campaign website
Seeking clarity, I turned to the legislative leaders’ aides. Turns out that was one commodity in short supply.
“This was a position the House had in their budget that the Senate has agreed to in the budget conference process,” Katie Betta, spokeswoman for Senate President Ben Albritton, told me. She suggested I contact the House with my questions.
  Speaker Daniel Perez via Florida House
So I tried several times to contact Betta’s counterpart in the House, Speaker Daniel Perez spokeswoman Amelia Angleton, but got no response. Perhaps it was “Talk Like a Mime Week” in Tallahassee.
It’s hard to say why they’re doing this, just judging by the paperwork that’s been made public so far. Florida has a rich tradition of open government, but when it comes to the current budget process our legislators have been imitating Peter Falk in “The In-Laws” and going serpentine.
  Clay Henderson via subject
“There is very little transparency here,” said Clay Henderson, a longtime environmental attorney and activist who literally wrote the book on land preservation in Florida (“Forces of Nature,” I give it five stars). “I’ve never seen a budget conference like this and guess no one has.”
The Seminole gambling money was “a solid commitment of funds,” he said. The repeal language “appears to wipe this out and basically says the Legislature will appropriate these funds as they see fit.”
He called the whole Seminole snatch-back “deeply disturbing.”
 Inaccessible and inexcusable
Even beyond the loss of the Seminole gambling money, legislators have made it clear that they want to cut the taxpayer resources going to Florida’s popular parks.
Both the House and the Senate are proposing to spend a mere $15 million on park facilities improvements, compared with $37 million requested by DeSantis (for once, playing the good guy in a park scenario).
The House also does not want to put any money toward the Florida Forever land-buying program, even though nearly 75% of all Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment to fund such programs.
But wait, it gets worse.
House negotiators want to eliminate 25 positions in the Florida Park Service that are currently vacant. Draper told me that move made no sense, given that the state recently approved turning a parcel of Panhandle land into a new park in Walton County, No. 176 for the state. Staffing that new one would require hiring people to fill those empty slots, he said.
“You can’t run a new park without any park rangers,” he said. “People love the parks, and they really love the park rangers. But the parks are desperately understaffed.”
A wise man (okay, it was me, so it was more like a wise guy) once said, “Florida’s state parks are one of the glories of this place we call home.” Our award-winning parks cover 800,000 acres where you can hike, fish, swim, bike, canoe, kayak, camp, and watch wildlife. At Florida Caverns State Park in Marianna, you can even spelunk, should you so desire.
There are places of awe-inspiring beauty, like Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park, home to one of the largest and deepest freshwater springs in the world. There are also places that preserve some slice of pre- Disney Florida kitsch, such as Weeki Wachee Springs State Park, where you can watch a mermaid show that dates to when it was a roadside attraction.
No matter where they are, people flock to them, seeking a respite from the overcrowded sprawl that’s spoiling the rest of Florida. The parks admitted some 30 million people last year, generating $3.6 billion (that’s billion with a B) in direct economic benefits to the surrounding local communities.
Given their economic and environmental value, can you believe that our duly elected dummkopfs want to shortchange the parks? It’s like owning a souped-up Lamborghini and equipping it with the cheapest tires possible.
Here’s a partial list of what’s broken, taken from the Politico story I mentioned earlier: “At Torreya State Park along the Apalachicola River, the campground has been closed since last August for repairs. The campground at Suwannee River State Park remains closed until August, as is an overlook along the river… And the boardwalk at the Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park near Tallahassee has been closed for repairs for nearly two years.”
Two years! That’s an inexcusable length of time for a public boardwalk to be inaccessible. If one of the Disney theme park rides were shut down for two years, people would demand the park’s managers be fired. In this case, the managers are those folks in Tallahassee who control the purse strings.
Given how passionate parks supporters have been in protesting DeSantis’ golf course plans last year, Henderson said, “There’s no excuse for cutting Florida Parks Service funding.”

 To the splatter zone!
It’s possible that our tightwad legislators don’t care about the parks because they’ve never been to one. If you happen to know any of these lawmakers, invite them out to join you for a trip to a spring, river, hiking trail, or fishing hole so they can see how magical these places can be. And they’re a lot cheaper than the theme parks, too.
In the past, when I heard about some problem with Florida’s state parks, I would sincerely wish that the legislators at fault would be forced to go to one park in particular: Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park. Then, at least in my imagination, they’d be forced to stand in the “splatter zone” for the park’s biggest celebrity, Lu the Hippo, until they saw the error of their ways.
Alas, Lu — made an honorary citizen of Florida by then-Gov. Lawton Chiles — has died at age 65 and gone to that great splatter zone in the sky.
Lacking Lu’s persuasive power to convince these lawmakers that they shouldn’t take the parks for granted, perhaps we must turn to more conventional means of turning this boneheaded budget move around.
DeSantis, lame duck though he is, still holds veto power over the budget. If Albritton and Perez fail to restore the parks money the way they should, I would encourage all of you to send the governor a strongly worded message encouraging him to employ his veto pen on that part of the budget.
Feel free to point out to him that, under the state Constitution, that’s his job.

The GOP-controlled House Appropriations Committee on Wednesday reported its version of the school aid budget for K-12 schools, universities, community colleges, the Michigan Department of Education and the Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential.
House Republicans set university funding at $2.4 billion with $461.3 million coming from the state’s general fund, which would be an overall increase of $76.4 million or 3.3%. However, overall funding for university operations would see a decrease of $828.1 million.
State Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the committee, said Republicans were trying to support Michigan high school graduates as they transition to adult life and encourage them to stay in the state to attend one of several public universities.
State Rep. Gregg Markkanen (R-Hancock), chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Higher Education and Community Colleges, said in a statement issued after the bills were reported that the budget corrected the imbalance of the state funding poured into Michigan State University and the University of Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus.
“Michigan’s largest universities have been getting way more than their fair share for far too long,” Markkanen said. “Our plan sets things right by trimming the fat off MSU and U of M and distributing that funding amongst our 13 other remarkable universities.”
But, much like its counterpart in the K-12 budget, the university budget has a series of cuts to operational grants and aims to restrict university diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
The budget raised questions for universities who stand to see their funding reduced if they do not obey certain requirements spelled out in boilerplate language, and the inconsistency of billions in one-time funding without a plan for years later.
Universities with an endowment fund between $1 billion and $5 billion would lose 50% of those funds, impacting Michigan State University, in particular. Those with endowments of $5 billion to $10 billion would lose 65% of their funds, and universities with endowments of $10 billion would lose 75% of their funds, which would affect the University of Michigan.
The sum total of campus investment funds, support payments and ending tuition waiver payments would be subject to a 31% cap on increases above what was appropriated to universities last year. When paired with estimated new Michigan Achievement Scholarship payments, the appropriations to universities would be conditioned on holding back undergraduate tuition and fee increases to 3% or $489, whichever is greater. Projected funding decreases in that case could range from 5.1% to 91.6%.
New boilerplate language would require universities to report on information related to the current university president, provide a list of the number of out-of-state students by state origin, provide a list of the number of international students categorized by citizenship, certify that all enrolled students are lawful residents, and provide the contact information of students who are not lawful residents to the director of Michigan Department of Lifelong Education, Advancement and Potential. 
Universities would have 5% of their campus investment funds withheld for disobeying those requirements, the same penalty if they allow transgender women to participate in women’s sports.
Vamping on a theme,  the House also added language that restricts public universities from having any common area spaces that are restricted by sex or race, and restricts institutions from having any public ceremonies or gatherings restricted by sex or race and authorizes the state budget director to withhold 5% of monthly campus investment funds payments until an institution complies.
The House plan also mandates universities abide by a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that held Harvard University’s limited race-based affirmative action program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Michigan House Republicans’ university budget includes language that states 25% of campus investment funds would be taken from any institution that violates the court’s holding.
State Rep. Matt Madodock (R-Milford) extolled the budget as making cuts to the “woke” universities and giving the money to “non-woke” universities.
Universities unclear on what the future holds
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Dan Hurley, CEO of the Michigan Association of State Universities, said the association was still analyzing the budget, but said it was “certainly comprehensive in its approach to reframing how the state funds its public universities and the students they enroll.”
“There are a lot of provisions that are not minor in their potential impact on allocations to universities and their long-term implications,” Hurley said.
Hurley noted as Markkanen did during the committee that attention will now go toward negotiating with the House, Senate and the governor’s office. He said the goal was, as a set of 15 public universities, to improve and to allow students the ability to afford a university degree.
“I think the litmus test on a final budget is how it will affect the universities’ abilities to produce a talent pipeline that the state desperately needs at this moment,” Hurley said.
One of his top-line observations is the more than a billion dollars in one-time funding monies to support the overall budget framework. As huge enterprises that have been around for hundreds of years, Hurley said they need predicability and sustainability. 
“We need to have a much better understanding of what the thinking is, what the plan is to maintain a healthy, vibrant public university ecosystem,” Hurley said. “In year two, in year three and year four down the road. To me, that is not clear at the moment.”
Bollin to universities: ‘Mind your budgets’
Bollin said the House was providing a roughly flat investment in higher education, which she said would make universities compete for the students they have. Although the move was characterized during the committee meeting as positively impacting some universities’ bottom lines over others, Bollin later said it was a move to support students wherever they end up going to attain a higher education. 
When it was noted that the budget changes the way some universities would receive money from the state, Bollin doubled down and said universities will have the same opportunity to receive funding.
“Maybe they ought to mind their budgets just like the rest of us. Everybody’s budget is getting tighter,” Bollin said. 
Bollin was asked about the DEI cuts and more specifically the language targeting transgender women in women’s sports. It was noted that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender were tenants of the state’s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act. Bollin was asked how the various budgets’ boilerplate language were not blatant violations of the state’s civil rights law.
Bollin said she didn’t see it that way, using language that essentially denies the very nature of transgender individuals.
“Frankly, I want to get away from focusing on those parts in the bill and in our policy statements. We are talking about educating and we want everybody to feel welcome; to come in and get a good education. And, frankly, we don’t want to see boys in girls’ sports. That’s universal. I don’t want to go into the restroom with a man,” Bollin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/DSC_0076-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Silver O. Jenkins, 29, who was found unresponsive in the Eau Claire County Jail on the morning of March 12, 2023, had by choice eaten very little in the 27 days leading up to  her death. She appeared ”emaciated,” raising concerns among jail and medical staff. Still, no interventions were taken to save her life because the sheriff’s office didn’t believe it had the authority for drastic measures and instead  continued to offer her food and water and monitor her condition.  
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The Eau Claire County in-custody death investigation report on Jenkins, prepared by the St. Croix Sheriff’s Office, was released Monday June 9.
St. Croix County Sheriff Scott Knudson had told the Wisconsin Examiner back in July 2024 that the death investigation had been completed in August 2023, but the report was not available through a  records request pending a review by the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ).
On Monday, Eau Claire County Sheriff Dave Riewstahl issued a press release saying that  the DOJ had “declined to bring charges.”
The investigation included interviews with the sheriff, the jail’s security services captain Travis Holbrook, four shift sergeants, 17 correctional officers, Christ Hill with the Eau Claire County Department of Health Services and five employees of Wellpath, an agency providing medical and mental health services to the jail.
“The Wisconsin Department of Justice concluded criminal charges were not appropriate in this matter,” said Riewestahl.
Jenkins was booked into jail on February 9, 2023, for criminal trespass and held on a $500 cash bond. By Feb. 18, Jenkins had refused 22 meals.
On Feb. 19, 2023, due to difficulty breathing, Jenkins was transferred to the Mayo Clinic, where she received two liters of IV fluids and was returned to jail on Feb. 20, 2023.
On February 28, 2023, Jenkins again requested to go to the hospital due to chest pains, but the request was denied.
On March 3, Jenkins was moved to a special needs cell at the suggestion of a clinical social worker, where there are better facilities for showering.
On March 5, Jenkins asked to see a nurse and go to a hospital, and again her request was denied.
The nurse attending Jenkins on March 5 said it was challenging to obtain heart rate and blood pressure because Jenkins would not sit still.
On March 8, Jenkins made a court appearance via a laptop held by correctional officer Craig Berg, who told the investigators on that date Jenkins looked malnourished. Berg later told Sgt. Phil  Field, the day-shift sergeant, that he didn’t think Jenkins would be physically able to make a court appearance the following week.
On March 8, Field sent out an email that states, “I witnessed her in her cell a few moments ago and observed that she is very emaciated from the last time I personally saw her. It appears that most of her hair is gone and her overall physical appearance does not look well. Her log indicates that she did eat some the past 2 days but mostly refused for many days before.”
The investigation revealed that Holbrook, who was in charge of the jail, took no action because he thought the situation was under control and the medical staff was monitoring her condition.
Riewestahl said he had asked Hill whether his office could use a Chapter 51 mental health detainment to address the feeding issue with Jenkins.
Hill told the investigators that Chapter 51 emergency detentions cannot be used for medical conditions, although it was Riewestahl’s opinion that Jenkins was also experiencing mental health issues.

Correctional officer Ryan Addis had the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. shift starting March 11. He said he passed by Jenkins’ cell in the early morning hours of March 12, between 1-2 a.m., and Jenkins was lying on the ground naked but moving. He didn’t enter the cell because in a previous situation, he did try to help her, and she lunged at him and he noted she had previously slept on the floor naked.
Addis said he noticed Jenkins was breathing and moving. He could also see her skeletal structure and what he observed concerned him, prompting Addis to send an email to the nursing staff asking what was being done for Jenkins.
Addis said he talked to his morning replacement, Byran Dachel, and they both thought Jenkins was dying.
Addis said he went home and told his wife that Jenkins would be dead within a week or a couple of days, and he determined, when he saw Jenkins again, to intervene and offer her some juice or “something.”
But later that Sunday morning, March 12, Jenkins was found in her cell by medical personnel not breathing, and her body was cold.

The autopsy findings, reported by Kristin E. Howell, M.D. Assistant Medical Examiner, attributed Jenkins’ death to “dehydration due to voluntary restriction of food and liquids.”
Day shift Sgt. Kevin Otto said in his interview that he didn’t believe Jenkins’ death was inevitable.
“I mean, all the players that were involved, something should have happened, and it always seemed to just get dumped back on us as a staff.”
He added, “I just think the staff was, were frustrated, we don’t know what to do with her. We’re not capable of doing it in our roles, and it seemed like the people that could weren’t doing it.”
Several of the jail staff said they felt frustrated in that all they were being asked to do was monitor and document Jenkins’ condition, but nothing was being done to ameliorate it other than offering her food and water.
Sheriff and jail captain
Since 2019, Jenkins had spent 205 days in the Eau Claire County jail for various charges.
Sheriff Riewstahl said that often when Jenkins was released, she would ask to be taken to a local hospital and then refuse to leave the hospital’s premises, resulting in a complaint and Jenkins returning to jail.
Riewstahl, Holbrook and others interviewed also noted that Jenkins from previous stints in the jail would often not eat the food offered to her and even ask for bottled water instead of using water from the jail sink.  
Hill said she believes Jenkins didn’t have a food disorder, but that refusing to eat gave her one thing she could control in her otherwise chaotic life.
“Silver has severe mental health issues, and our jail is the largest mental health facility here in Eau Claire County,” said Riewestahl. “Jails have been turned into the answer for mental health.”
He added, “we are technically a jail but the people that come to us have more mental health crisis needs at a different level than a Chapter 51 [a person who is involuntarily committed for mental health reasons].”
Investigator Dustin Geisness asked Riewestahl if he was aware of any concerns being expressed by the jail or medical staff regarding Jenkins.
“Ultimately, the hunger strike was a concern, and it was a concern every time she’s been here,” he said.
Holbrook also told investigators there was concern every time Jenkins returned to jail
“Obviously we know Silver as often as she’s here,” he said. “We know she‘s a problematic inmate, not cooperative, whatever. We knew that something potentially could happen someday.”
He added, “She was a non-cooperative inmate. She was offered food, medical services. A lot of times or sometimes she would refuse that, sometimes she wouldn’t. You never knew what she was going to  do.”
He said Jenkins was never on a full hunger strike and occasionally would eat small amounts of food offered.
He was asked about March 12 when she was naked on the floor and noted that was normal behavior for Jenkins and that she was often naked.
Holbrook also said the local hospitals didn’t want to see Jenkins unless it was an emergency because she had been disruptive there during previous visits. He said because everyone was aware the hospitals were reluctant to see Jenkins that may have played a part in not sending her to a hospital again before her death.
“Most of the hospitals don’t want nothing to do with her here, so even when we’d bring her there for something, we’d get a lot of heat from the hospital,” he said.    
Holbrook was asked by the investigator after Feb. 19,  when Jenkins returned from the hospital,  if anything  different was done for Jenkins besides  documenting her condition and food intake.
 “They’re just still documenting, documenting, documenting and in my opinion that sounds like the definition of insanity,” said investigator Geisness. Holbrook concurred, saying, “Over and over.”
Holbrook was also asked, “Who is ultimately responsible for this jail?” and he responded, “Ultimately, ultimately, yeah, that’s exactly. That’s the problem.”
Holbrook also said there was a “leadership issue,” but he didn’t specifically place responsibility for the issue on himself or staff or the sheriff.
Investigator Capt. Tim Kufus asked a similar question of the sheriff: “But while she’s here, whose responsibility is she?”
Riewestahl responded, “Ours.”
“When you’re saying ours, you’re saying collectively?” asked Kufus.
“The sheriff, the sheriff’s office,” responded Riewestahl
“Okay, and are you the …”
“I’m the sheriff,” said Riewestahl.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State Sen. Jane Raybould announced Thursday that she will not seek reelection to her central Lincoln seat in 2026, retiring at the end of her term after 16 years in public service.
Raybould, 66, said she has been honored and humbled by getting to serve on the Lancaster County Board of Commissioners, Lincoln City Council and in the Nebraska Legislature. In each office, she said she juggled family obligations and outside work.
“Knowing I was making a difference in my community has been tremendously rewarding and profoundly fulfilling,” Raybould said in a statement Thursday to the Nebraska Examiner.

Raybould made clear that her announcement is not a resignation speech, writing: “Oh no, not even close!” She said she remains committed and dedicated “to being the most effective senator” in her remaining year and a half in office. 
That window will likely include a revived effort to slow the state’s minimum wage, a Raybould priority that stalled just a couple of weeks ago, receiving pushback from some voters who supported the measure on the ballot just a few years ago.
“I look forward to working with my colleagues as I have always done to create policies that help all Nebraska families and businesses thrive in a state that I love,” Raybould wrote.
Raybould, a Democrat, ran for lieutenant governor in 2014 with former University of Nebraska Regent Chuck Hassebrook in 2014, and, challenged Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2018, falling short both times. 
Raybould served as chair of the Lincoln City Council during the COVID-19 pandemic, and she called it a “distinct honor” to work with Lincoln Mayor Leirion Gaylor Baird and the late Pat Lopez, former director of the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department.
“We worked together to keep our community safe, and we did,” Raybould said.

In 2023, Raybould succeeded former Lincoln State Sen. Patty Pansing Brooks, who was term-limited out of the seat representing Legislative District 28. Pansing Brooks endorsed Raybould. 
No one had announced a 2026 campaign for the seat by Raybould’s announcement.
Legislative record
In Raybould’s first three legislative years, she introduced a variety of bills, including those focusing on affordable housing, campaign finance reform, red-flag gun legislation, emergency care for survivors of sexual assault, expanded access to and coverage of contraception, mental health access and expanding the state’s homestead exemption.
Raybould, who now chairs the Legislature’s State-Tribal Relations Committee, has also taken the mantle to support indigenous Nebraskans from past senators, which helped influence the creation of a state liaison for missing and murdered indigenous persons.
In 2024, multiple Raybould bills helped prioritize grants for water improvement projects for tribal lands under federal no-drink orders and allowed state recognition of tribal emergency protection orders.
Raybould sometimes stood on an island in her legislative service, such as singing on the legislative floor after conservatives booted her from an assignment on the Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee for a desired partisan lean.

In 2023, she was a leading voice against the state’s enactment of “constitutional carry,” and she regularly spoke against bills to restrict abortion access and to advance “needless culture-war attacks” against transgender children and adults.
She has also tried multiple times to claw back hundreds of millions of dollars from the proposed Perkins County Canal project and to slow the state’s “accelerated” income tax cuts. By 2027, the income tax rate for corporations and individuals making more than $18,000 will drop to 3.99%.
A 2025 partnership with State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln could soon lead to statewide evidence-based nurse home visitations for newborns and their families.
Minimum wage fight
Perceptions of Raybould have been reshaped by the 2025 fight over Legislative Bill 258, her effort to slow the voter-approved increase in the state minimum wage. That bill is set to resurface in 2026. 
Voters in 2022, the same year Raybould was elected to the Legislature, raised the minimum wage by $1.50 multiple times, from $9 before the law to $15 by Jan. 1, 2026. Voters also approved annual inflationary increases after beginning in 2027.

LB 258, which Raybould designated as her 2025 priority and amended during negotiations, would instead lock annual minimum wage increases at 1.75%, which is smaller than average inflation in recent years. It also would increase a 90-day “training wage” for teen workers to roughly 90% of the state minimum wage, rather than 75% of the federal minimum wage. It would apply only to 16-19 year olds.
Under her proposal, teens aged 14 and 15 could instead be paid a “youth minimum wage.” As lawmakers return in 2026, Raybould has suggested locking that wage at $15 instead of starting at $13.50, the current minimum wage, with small increases every five years.
Raybould has said the fixed increase offers better stability and predictability for businesses that need to plan and that her motivation is to help small businesses and others who might not be able to absorb less predictable costs.
“You have to always balance it out to make sure that we maintain the economic vitality and vibrancy and economic growth in our state without falling off and creating a cycle of cost increases that are so much harder for Nebraska families to be able to afford,” Raybould said in April.



Raybould declared a conflict of interest on the legislation shortly after introducing it because her family owns B&R Stores, the grocery store chain that includes Russ’s Market and Super Saver. She stepped down as vice president of her family company in late March and continues to serve as vice chair on the company board.
The bill continues to have 33 supporters — 32 of 33 Republicans and Raybould as the lone Democratic supporter — the minimum support needed under the Nebraska Constitution to change or repeal laws that voters have enacted.

The minimum wage fight turned deeply personal among progressive legislators, including State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, who said she had “never seen such a blatant, bald-faced, self-serving, self-dealing, selfish, unethical example of self-dealing as this bill.” 
Others, such as State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, who led the opposition that stalled Raybould’s bill this year, said consumers didn’t care about the age of employees, which should be “equal pay for equal work.” The bill was defeated by a filibuster when one of Raybould’s supporters briefly left the legislative floor.
Republicans had defended Raybould for what they said was a thoughtful approach that properly considered federal work restrictions on young workers.
Future plans
Raybould said she plans to focus in 2026 on “true property tax relief” while working to address the state’s projected structural budget deficit compounded by the state’s 2023 income tax cuts.

Raybould said her decision not to seek reelection was “a thoughtful one long in the making,” similar to the “deliberate and well-scheduled plan” to retire from her family company this year.
Raybould said those “who want to rush to judgment” that her decision is directly related to the “rather brutal” 2025 session “are wrong, but you are also welcome to speculate.” 
“There is no doubt it certainly was a tough one,” she said.
However, Raybould said that those who know her know she has “never shied away from any controversial issue, fought tirelessly and advocated for smart policies for working families, small businesses and the most vulnerable.”
Raybould said previously she had “never cared, not ever” about reelection, but that she did care about “doing the right thing every day for the right reasons that help the most Nebraskans.”

In early 2024, she was diagnosed with a rare type of blood cancer: splenic marginal zone lymphoma, which took her away from much of the 2024 session.
Raybould said her family has “enthusiastically and wholeheartedly supported” her political career, “beyond anyone’s reasonable expectations.” She said reflected on her “own mortality and life priorities.”
“Thank you, dear family, for all the sacrifices and sharing that you have made. Now, it is my turn to be the full-time spouse, mom, grandma, sister, aunt and friend they deserve. I plan to spend more time with all of them,” Raybould said. 
“I’m officially announcing that my next campaign is to be the best grandma ever!”

Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.Education advocates are making a push for more investment in public schools from the state as the Republican-led Joint Finance Committee plans to take up portions of the budget related to K-12 schools during its Thursday meeting.
The issue has been a top concern for Wisconsinites who came out to budget listening sessions and was one of Gov. Tony Evers’ priorities in his budget proposal. Evers proposed that the state spend an additional $3.1 billion on K-12 education. Evers and Republican leaders were negotiating on the spending for education as well as taxes and other parts of the budget until last week when negotiations reached an impasse. 
Evers has said that Republicans were unwilling to compromise on his funding priorities, including making “meaningful investments for K-12 schools, to continue Child Care Counts to help lower the cost of child care for working families and to prevent further campus closures and layoffs at our UW System.” He said he was willing to support their tax proposal, which Republicans have said included income and retiree tax cuts. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) said on WISN 12’s UpFront that Evers “lied” about Republicans walking away from the negotiating table.
“We’re willing to do it, just not as much as he wanted… When you read that statement, it makes it sound like we were at zero,” Vos said. “We were not at zero on any of those topics. We tried to find a way to invest in child care that actually went to the parents, and to make sure that we weren’t just having to go to a business. We tried to find a way to look at education so that money would actually go back to school districts across the state. It just wasn’t enough for what he wanted.” 
Public education advocates said school districts are in dire need of a significant investment of state dollars, especially for special education. After lobbying for the last week, many are concerned that when Republicans finally announce their proposal it won’t be enough. 
State Superintendent Jill Underly told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview Wednesday afternoon that she is anticipating that Republicans will put forth more short-term solutions, but she said schools and students can’t continue functioning in that way. 
Underly compared the situation of education funding in Wisconsin to a road trip.
“The gas tank is nearly empty, and you’re trying to coast… you’re turning the air conditioning off… going at a lower speed limit, just to save a little fuel and the state budget every two years. I kind of look at them as like these exits to gas stations,” Underly said. “We keep passing up these opportunities to refuel. Schools are running on fumes, and we see the stress that is having an our system — the number of referendums, the anxiety around whether or not we’re going to have the referendum or not in our communities. Wisconsin public schools have been underfunded for decades.” 
The one thing lawmakers must do, Underly said, is increase the special education reimbursement rate to a minimum of 60%, back to the levels of the 1990s. 
“It used to be 60% but they haven’t been keeping up their promise to public schools,” Underly said. “They need to raise the special education reimbursement rate. Anything less than 60% is once again failing to meet urgent needs.”
The Wisconsin Public Education Network is encouraging advocates to show up at the committee meeting Thursday and continue pushing lawmakers and Evers to invest. Executive Director Heather DuBois Bourenane told the Examiner that she is concerned lawmakers are planning on “low balling” special education funding, even as she said she has never seen the education community so united in its insistence on one need.
“We’re familiar with the way they work in that caucus and in the Joint Finance Committee,” DuBois Bourenane said. “The pattern of the past has been to go around the state and listen to the concerns that are raised or at least get the appearance of listening, and then reject those concerns and demands and put forward a budget that fails in almost every way to prioritize the priority needs for our communities.” 
While it’s unclear what Republicans will ultimately do, budget papers prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau includes three options when it comes to special education reimbursement rate: the first is to raise the rate to 60% sum sufficient — as Evers has proposed; the second is to leave the rate at 31.5% sum certain by investing an additional $35.8 million and the third is to raise the rate to an estimated 35% by providing an additional $68.6 million in 2023-24 and $86.2 million in 2024-25. 
The paper also includes options for investing more in the high cost of special education, which provides additional aid to reimburse 90% of the cost of educating students whose special education costs exceed $30,000 in a single year. 
The School Administrators Alliance (SAA) sent an update to its members on Monday, pointing out what was in the budget papers and saying the committee “appears poised to focus spending on High-Cost Special Education Aid and the School Levy Tax Credit, rather than significantly raising the primary special education categorical aid.”
SAA Executive Director Dee Pettack said in the email that if that’s the route lawmakers take, it would “result in minimal new, spendable resources for classrooms and students.”
Public school funding was one of the top priorities mentioned by Wisconsinites at the four budget hearings held by the budget committee across the state in March. 
“I just think it’s time to say enough is enough,” DuBois Bourenane said. “We’re really urging people to do whatever they can before our lawmakers vote on this budget, to say that we are really going to accept nothing less than a budget that stops this cycle of insufficient state support for priority needs and demand better.” 
Pettack and leaders of the Wisconsin Association of School Boards, Southeast Wisconsin School Alliance and the Wisconsin Rural Schools Alliance also issued a joint letter Tuesday urging the committee to “meet this moment with the urgency it requires,” adding that the budget provides the opportunity to allocate resources that will help students achieve.
The letter detailed the situation that a low special education reimbursement has placed districts in as they struggle to fund the mandated services and must fill in the gaps with funds from their general budgets.
“The lack of an adequate state reimbursement for mandated special education programs and services negatively affects all other academic programs, including career and technical education, reading interventionists, teachers and counselors, STEM, dual enrollment, music, art and more,” the organizations stated. “While small increases in special education reimbursement have been achieved in recent state budgets, costs for special education programming and services have grown much faster than those increases, leaving public schools in a stagnant situation.” 
“Should we fail in this task, we are not only hurting Wisconsin’s youth today but also our chances to compete in tomorrow’s economy,” the leaders wrote. 
If the proposal from Republicans isn’t adequate, Underly said Evers doesn’t have to sign the budget. Republican lawmakers have expressed confidence that they will put a budget on Evers’ desk that he will sign. 
“There’s that, and then we keep negotiating. We keep things as they are right now. We keep moving forward,” Underly said. “But our schools and our kids, they can’t continue to wait for this… These are short term fixes, I think, that they keep talking about, and we can’t continue down this path. We need to fix it so that we’re setting ourselves up for success. Everything else is just really short sighted.”
WPEN and others want Evers to use his veto power should the proposal not be sufficient. DuBois Bourenane said dozens of organizations have signed on to a letter calling on Evers to reject any budget that doesn’t meet the state’s needs and priorities.
“What we want them to do is negotiate in good faith and reject any budget that doesn’t meet the needs of our kids, and just keep going back to the drawing board until you reach a bipartisan agreement that actually does meet those needs,” DuBois Bourenane said. “Gov. Evers has the power to break this cycle. He has the power of his veto pen. He has the power of his negotiating authority, and we expect him to use it right and people have got his back.”
The budget deadline is June 30. If it is not completed by then, the state continues to operate under the 2023-25 budget. 
“Nobody wants [the process] to be drawn out any longer than it is,” DuBois Bourenane said. “Those are valid concerns. But the fact is we are in a really critical tension point right now, and if any people care even a little bit about this, now is the time that they should be speaking out.”

(Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service/Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1)As hot, dry weather settles in, officials are predicting a greater than usual likelihood that Idaho will experience significant wildfires this summer.
The Predictive Services Office at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise’s new forecast for June through September shows an above normal potential for significant wildfire developing in northern Idaho this month. The above normal potential for significant wildfire then expands into southern Idaho and central Idaho from July into September.
“What that means is if an accidental ignition occurs or a lighting ignition occurs, there is going to be a greater potential for those ignitions to develop into serious incidents that get large enough to affect people or pose a risk to life or property,” said Rebecca Paterson, a public affairs specialist for the the Bureau of Land Management who is based at the National Interagency Fire Center, or NIFC, in Boise.

Even though there was a healthy snowpack in many parts of Idaho this winter, warm, dry weather has rapidly melted the snowpack, which contributes to the risk of wildfire, Paterson said. 
Abundant drying grass crops throughout southern Idaho, mixed with forecasts for low levels of precipitation and high temperature also contribute to the risk, she said. 
Located next to the Boise Airport, NIFC is the country’s headquarters for wildland fire operations. Several different agencies are represented at NIFC, including the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service and more. 
 State of Idaho, federal government set aside money to boost firefighter pay following concerns 

Both the state and federal government have taken steps to address widespread concern over pay for wildland firefighters.
In March, the Idaho Legislature’s budget committee approved $1 million in pay bonuses for state firefighters working for the Idaho Department of Lands. 
That same month, the U.S. Department of Interior announced permanent pay increases for federal and tribal wildland firefighters.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Paterson said the federal pay increases are a result of years worth of efforts to help recruit and retrain firefighters. She said the firefighters who stand to benefit most from the pay increases are firefighters in the beginning stages of their career at the lower end of the pay scale.
It’s too early to tell how the raises are affecting retention, but on Monday afternoon a Department of Interior spokeswoman said hiring is up slightly compared to a year ago. As of June 2, the U.S. Department of Interior had hired 4,830 wildland fire personnel across the country, which is up slightly from a year ago, the spokeswoman said. 
But even with steps taken to address pay and turnover, Idaho Department of Lands Director Dustin Miller still expressed concern with the levels of federal nonfirefighting staff and the ability to hire and retain mid- to upper-management level engine captains in Idaho.
“I am confident in the amount of resources we are going to have this year (at the state level, but) what is concerning is the support positions at the federal level,” Miller said in a phone interview Monday. “We have been told to expect the same level of initial attack resources from the U.S. Forest Service, but what is concerning is that many nonfire staff who pay critical roles in incident management teams have taken various voluntary departure options offered by the federal government.”  
At the state level, Miller said Idaho will also have slightly more firefighters than last year. But Miller said Idaho still struggles to fill permanent engine captain positions. As a result, Miller said the Idaho Department of Lands will only be able to staff 50% of the engines with seven-days-per-week coverage. 
Miller said the Idaho Department of Lands is looking to other permanent staff members who have retained their fire qualifications to help boost staffing and coverage.
“We are ready to go this fire season,” Miller said. “We have most of the resources we need and, again, we will be relying heavily on others within the Department of Lands to participate at some level during fire season.”
  Support for Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund 

Another potential concern is funding in Idaho’s state wildfire suppression fund. This year, the Idaho Legislature approved transferring $40 million to the state’s Fire Suppression Deficiency Fund, the Sun previously reported. However the $40 million is less than the $58 million the state spent fighting wildfires in 2024 alone.

If the state spends more money than it has available to fight wildfires, it can still pay its bills through a process called deficiency warrants. But then the state would need to go back to the Idaho Legislature next year with bills for the deficiency warrants, which would be a little bit like using a credit card to pay wildfire bills. 
At any rate, Gov. Brad Little had requested $60 million in new funding (not just the $40 million) for the wildfire account and urged legislators to give the state the tools it needs to aggressively fight wildfires from the beginning.
Partnerships and relationships between different state and federal agencies are key factors in fighting wildfires.
In Idaho, the location of where a fire starts plays a role in determining which agency responds. Depending on jurisdiction, what type of land the fire is located on and how big the fire is, federal wildland firefighters, state firefighters, the local community fire department or a volunteer fire protection service may show up to fight the fire. 
 Fire officials call on the public to help reduce risk of wildfire 

While firefighters cannot prevent lightning strikes from starting wildfires, Paterson did say Idahoans can help reduce the risk of wildfire this summer. Most of the wildfires in Idaho in recent years have been caused by people.
Dousing all campfires and extinguishing them dead out, avoiding parking vehicles on grass and preventing chains from dragging behind vehicles and throwing off sparks can all help prevent wildfires. 
“Weather, climate and fuel conditions cause those ignitions to become serious incidents, perhaps a lot faster than you expect, and tax responders’ ability to respond,” Paterson said.

The program on the DOGE chopping block has benefits large and small, writes past participant Jordan Giese. We should stand up for it.
The post Wyoming Conservation Corps protects resources and changes lives. It’s worth fighting for. appeared first on WyoFile .","It’s August 2015, and I am in the Red Desert on a job site with my Wyoming Conservation Corps crew. We are helping put up barbed wire fences around “hummocks,” curious turtle-shaped protrusions of ground left behind after cattle scar up the land. The work was hard and so were the sleeping conditions. We camped in a bowl and would wake to sub-freezing temperatures in the middle of summer. Worth it to be in the midst of a vast sage expanse with blue skies as far as the eye can see — beautiful. 

Opinion

My friend is helping hold a tool to keep the wire taught as we wrap it around a post. He’s tall and lanky with large veins running down his arms. Some of the line flies free and one of the barbs perfectly punctures one of his lifelines, sending a comical if not slightly concerning squirt of blood across the sage sea. He quickly clamps a hand over his arm. A short time later, he returns, only for the next wayward wire to hit him in the same spot. “Goddamnit!” he yells, though mostly joking. 
WCC volunteers like that decade-old version of my friends and me are heading into the hills right now for what could be the last season the organization operates. Recently, the Department of Government Efficiency announced a $400 million cut to Americorps. Even with a recent court order to restore funding, it was only on behalf of 24 blue states; Wyoming won’t see this money flow back for the foreseeable future. 
The potentially fatal cuts facing the Wyoming Conservation Corps mean future rag-tag bunches of young folks won’t get to camp for days at a time, eat beans and drink instant coffee in return for 12-hour days working to improve public land and support natural resource management. Sounds rough, but would I do it again? Absolutely. 
I was a WCC crew member in 2015 when I was 22. I was wrapping up my political science degree at the University of Wyoming, but I yearned for hands-on work. It was also the summer Donald Trump announced his candidacy, and I looked at slowly loading news articles when we’d get spotty service between job sites. I still remember him coming down the gilded escalator and not quite knowing any of the implications that it would have. WCC always seemed so permanent then because it came to completely encompass my life for the better part of four months. In that time, I suffered tick bites, second-degree sunburns and once in a lifetime views of the Milky Way. People pay good money to see the things I saw. Instead, I got paid enough to keep my $250-a-month dingy basement apartment over the summer.  
Often, WCC “hitches” were negotiated with state and federal agencies that, even 10 years ago, were catastrophically behind on maintenance. It was usually advertised as trail building and dead-tree felling. Many times, we helped state agencies paint decaying facilities’ walls. These were 10-day ventures with a Suburban, five other team members, and two leaders who all work at 5 a.m. and worked until after 6 p.m. 
I would love to give you a complete history of each hitch etched into my heart. I could tell you about the lightning around Bear Lodge (Devil’s Tower), which lit the dark campgrounds so well you could swear it was noon. Or the time WCC’s crew coordinator drove out to take me to get cell service to call friends after one took his own life. I will never forget his kindness in the face of what seemed like overwhelming odds to help me throw a lifeline back home. I always fondly remember Pepsi, not because I love soda, but because after several days pulling cheat-grass in a canyon to protect petroglyphs, it might as well have been an ice-cold beer.
The same punctured friend from the Red Desert (who I still keep in touch with and roomed with for several years after) told another friend that even though I was smaller and not as physically strong, I had earned his respect because I never gave in to the grueling demands of the job. I would work my shift. I would eat my hastily packed sandwich. Then I would go back to camp and read (my favorite that summer was “All the Shah’s Men”). It was as close to a traditional lifestyle that a lot of folks cheering on Americorps’ downfall espouse, but I doubt we’ll see them out there volunteering to fix up trails and parks abandoned by DOGE.
But WCC is more than an opportunity for young people to prove themselves. We helped lighten the load for already overworked state employees. I won’t make the cost-benefit argument, mostly because WCC is a drop in the bucket as far as the national budget. It’s more than a drop though. Sometime between nearly giving in to heat exhaustion while spraying bull thistle in full PPE and seeing runners appear out of nowhere in the Red Desert (pilgrims on the Continental Divide Trail), I discovered a love for Wyoming I didn’t know I had. I’m a first-generation Wyomingite; I was born here but I have no long ties to ranching families or farmers. WCC gave me that identity as a Wyomingite, an identity that came flooding out of a wellspring. 
So, get out there. Don’t be afraid to tell elected officials what you think at their town halls. Vote a few out when the next election comes around. More importantly, though, visit all the cultural sites in Wyoming and record their demise. Note every single defaced marker that previously gave a parent respite to read on a trail with their kids. Watch those trails disappear off maps or be marked “closed” one by one, bleeding like the veins in my friend’s arm. Remind someone down the road of what was left to rot. Make someone mad. Anger can be a little corrosive, but it can also be clarifying, letting us know just what the hell is wrong.

The Davidson County District Attorney’s Office is facing scrutiny for not filing charges after a man struck a transgender woman in the head at a Nashville business in May.
Surveillance footage from the office of Extra Space Storage on Charlotte Pike shows 35-year-old Jeremiah Hendricks approaching 27-year-old Tyler Flanagan on May 30 and striking her, causing her sunglasses to fly off of her face.
In a statement issued June 9, the Metro Nashville Police Department wrote that “after discussion with the District Attorney’s Office, the MNPD is not placing any charges.”
The Metro Nashville Council’s LGBTQ Caucus is now calling for the district attorney to complete a “more thorough analysis” of the case, including whether the case falls under Tennessee’s hate crime law.
MNPD spokesperson Don Aaron said the department’s Specialized Investigations Division, which looks into hate crimes, reviewed the footage.

District Attorney General Glenn Funk will review the case early next week upon returning from vacation, according to the LGBTQ Caucus. In the meantime, the caucus stated MNPD must “recall and restate its press release to reflect the DA’s new review and intended actions.”
The police statement — details of which Flanagan and her attorney dispute — provides a brief description of the altercation and notes that both parties can choose to privately prosecute the case.
Flanagan and a friend reported that former Black Tie Moving employee Hendricks and his coworkers used transphobic and homophobic slurs toward them before the physical attack, according to police.
Hendricks, who is Black, and his coworkers accused Flanagan and her friend of using “racially insulting language,” according to the MNPD statement. Hendricks also said Flanagan threw a milkshake toward him. Surveillance footage shows Flanagan tossing something out of the car, but it’s not clear whether Hendricks, who was several feet behind the vehicle, was hit by the cup.
Attempts to reach Hendricks for comment were unsuccessful.
Civil Rights attorney Abby Rubenfeld, known for filing the lawsuit that led to Tennessee’s role in the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States, is representing Flanagan. Rubenfeld said the claim that Flanagan and her friend used racial names toward Hendricks is “false and unsupported.” She also said the police description of Hendricks striking Flanagan with an “open hand” is incorrect.
“An unsupported allegation of a drink being thrown and liquid perhaps spilling on an individual is not in any way comparable to a physical assault, a brutal punch to the head of an unsuspecting, vulnerable person, which is what happened here and is documented on video,” Rubenfeld stated.
The LGBTQ Caucus also expressed concern at the “impression that throwing a milkshake at someone is the equivalent of a physical assault.”
How the process works
District attorneys “have an obligation to look into (a) case to see if a conviction can be obtained,” but they also have authority to screen cases before they get to court to determine which cases are the best use of the office’s scarce resources, said Nashville criminal defense attorney David Raybin, speaking generally about the criminal justice system as an attorney who is not representing either party in the case.
“All criminal cases are brought in the name of the state … and the district attorney is the one who brings the charges under the law,” Raybin said. “The DA has discretion to charge someone or not, even though the victim of an alleged assault may want to bring charges.”
Davidson County is one of many that screen cases to avoid overwhelming the courts with cases that may lack sufficient evidence or have legitimate defenses that could impact the likelihood of a conviction, he said. The parties in an assault case can also choose to file a civil lawsuit.
Aaron said neither Flanagan nor Hendricks has filed charges independently. 
Rubenfeld said Flanagan is “waiting for the DA to bring charges, as they should when there is an obvious, documented, unprovoked assault captured on video.”
In a post on Instagram, Flanagan said the attack was “intentional and came from hate.”
“This is the first time ever in Nashville I’ve ever felt so unsafe, terrified for my safety in that moment a grown man twice my size fully trying to beat me,” she wrote.
Black Tie Moving fired Hendricks after reviewing the incident, which it described in a statement as “deeply troubling and entirely unacceptable.”

(AmeriCorps photo)“The needs will go unmet.” 
That’s what Habitat for Humanity of Kanawha and Putnam executive director Andrew Blackwood told West Virginia Watch in April when asked about the cuts the Trump administration made to AmeriCorps that month. In total, an estimated 32,000 AmeriCorps service members were told to stop working. 
AmeriCorps members, of course, often do vital service work in distressed areas for low pay. You name it, and an AmeriCorps member has probably done it. After school programs, disaster clean up, home repair, the list goes on. It’s an important service program that steps in to fill gaps that our local and state governments and nonprofits simply can’t afford to do. 
That’s why it was so disappointing that West Virginia didn’t join the multistate lawsuit to challenge the program’s termination. Our attorney general J.B. McCuskey, who early into his role has already joined lawsuits to challenge other states’ own laws, couldn’t be bothered to provide a comment to West Virginia Watch. 
A spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who would be the first to tout his bona fides in suing the Obama and Biden administrations when he was West Virginia’s attorney general, said, “The governor believes most matters can be solved through collaboration and communication rather than lawsuits. The governor will continue to fight to protect all West Virginians and will work diligently to help all those impacted.”
Well that’s great and all. But I wonder if he would repeat that now, after a judge ruled that the AmeriCorps members can return in the 24 states and Washington D.C. that sued the administration in April. Those two dozen states will now have the young (although many older Americans join AmeriCorps, too), eager people returning to work and helping the communities they’ve chosen to make home, doing projects, supporting their neighbors. 
A win for them; a loss for us. Unfortunately because of our elected leaders’ decision not to join the lawsuit, West Virginia won’t be one of those states. 
To be fair, the governor’s office has a point. Most matters should be resolved through collaboration. 
But it never should have gotten to this point in the first place. 
This year we’ve seen story after story of programs, grants, employees and offices being cut all across the country. Some people, organizations, cities or states sue. Others hope that their senators, congress members or governor will get down on their knees and beg the administration to spare their states from the cuts and pain. Sometimes, sometimes, it works. Usually it hasn’t.
We’re not a healthy, efficient democracy if you have to routinely beg someone to change their mind after, arguably illegally, killing your job, grant or anything else. Here in West Virginia we’ve seen a grant terminated that would help the state address its long history of PFAS contamination. Our very own Department of Environmental Protection wanted that grant. They applied for it. They won it. Then, they saw it taken away. 
Health professionals who work on black lung disease and other issues at NIOSH in Morgantown had their jobs cut. It took congressional and advocate pressure, and ultimately, a lawsuit, to get Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to change his mind. 
That should never have happened. But it did. I could go on with things in West Virginia or what I’ve seen and heard from friends in other states. 
We already live in a state where some of our most basic services for some of our most vulnerable people are heavily reliant on the work of volunteers and government grants. The reality is our politics today makes simple “collaboration” a pipe dream, especially when doing so would require members of a certain political party to publicly acknowledge that these vital services are more than just the woke ideologies they want them to be. 
So many of these vital services — from efforts to improve our drinking water, protect miners’ health and feed families to programs that provide coaching for our kids, improve homes and safeguard our national parks — face political threats. 
It’s going to be hard to ignore the ramifications of these cuts and the impacts they have on average West Virginians for long. The legal system has, unfortunately, proven to be one of the only effective tools we have to stave off the worst of these consequences. 
We can’t let it go on like this forever. This can’t become a genie that stays out of the lamp. If we allow future administrations, whether they’re Democrat, Republican or another party, to casually and unilaterally upend systems, no one will be safe. What’s to stop a Democratic president from attacking programs that are seen to help “red states?” 
Our electeds must do a better job at speaking up — and actually doing something — for the West Virginians who stand to lose the most when funding for programs that serve our state are cut. The madness has to end, and it’s their job to stop it.

(Lexi Browning | West Virginia Watch)West Virginia’s ranking for child well-being has made slight improvements, but the state is still struggling with students meeting basic academic benchmarks.
The new Kids Count Data Book from the Annie E. Casey Foundation said that in 2024, 75% of West Virginia’s fourth graders were not proficient in reading, and 82% of the state’s eighth graders were not proficient in math. 
The annual report assesses childhood well-being in every state.
The data showed that, nationally, students are struggling with reading and math since the COVID-19 pandemic’s interruptions to learning. Plus, chronic absenteeism has become a major challenge. 
West Virginia ranks 45th in education, according to the report that was released earlier this week. 
“State lawmakers have spent the last few years focusing on really a small sliver of the population by passing policies related to private school and home school,” said Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, which is West Virginia’s member of the Casey Foundation’s Kids Count network. 
“We’re always going to see most of our kids [receive] their education through public schools. So if we really want to boost these outcomes in education, we have to focus our efforts on where kids are, in our public school system,” she continued.
Additionally, the number of children attending early childhood education programs worsened. Around 70% of West Virginia children ages three and four are not enrolled in school pre-school or child care, which is the second-worst rate in the country. 
The state is woefully short in child care programs, which Allen said has played a part in the decline of students attending preschool.
“Whether it’s Head Start or pre-K or child care — and those are areas where we have seen backsliding or lack of investment from the state level — and we know early childhood education is so formative for children’s future,” she said, adding that the state is spending less on child care than it did before the pandemic. 
West Virginia moved to 41st in child well-being — up from 44th last year. In 2023, 20% of West Virginia’s kids lived in poverty, an improvement over the previous year’s rate of 25%. 
The state is third best in the country for health insurance coverage, and only 3% of kids are uninsured. Many West Virginia children use the state’s Medicaid Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, but potential federal cuts and changes to Medicaid could threaten that coverage.
“Children with health insurance are more likely to have a regular source of health care they can access for preventive services, developmental screenings and treatment for physical or mental health needs,” the report said. 
However, nearly 10% of babies were low birth weight, placing the state at 45th in that category. Low birth weight is a leading cause of infant death in the United States, and these babies have a higher probability of developmental problems and disabilities. 
The share of U.S. infants with a low birth weight has steadily worsened for more than 30 years, the report said, and the rate remains higher than most other peer nations.

The Public Library Training Institute “has long served as a continuing education program for library practitioners, support staff, and trustees of South Dakota public libraries who do not hold formal library degrees,” according to a Wednesday press release from the state Department of Education.
Fifteen students from 13 libraries, with jobs ranging from library director to front-line staff, attended the 2025 training.
The institute has helped librarians earn their certificates – typically pursued by those seeking a master’s degree in library science – since 1985, initially with courses at what was then Northern State College in Aberdeen. 
State Library secures full federal funding, will resume interlibrary loan deliveries

The State Library, in partnership with the Institute of Museum and Library Services in Washington, D.C., has offered financial support for the training.  
Students attend in-person sessions for one week each June, supplemented by online coursework throughout the year. Librarians who complete the program are awarded a certificate of public library management and are recognized as certified library practitioners.
“This year, our students delved into crucial aspects of information literacy, library resources, and emerging technologies,” State Librarian George Seamon said in the press release on this year’s graduates. “They explored topics such as digital literacy, AI in libraries, makerspaces, SDSL-provided resources, educational programming through the SD Discovery Center, and research databases.”
Due to cuts by the South Dakota Legislature, however, 2025 will be the final year for the institute “in its current form,” Wednesday’s press release said. Former Gov. Kristi Noem had proposed budget cuts large enough to threaten the State Library’s access to federal funding. Lawmakers compromised on a budget figure large enough to allow the state to secure federal matching funds, but not large enough to maintain the full range of library services.
The State Library will still pay for statewide access to a host of curated databases, keep most of its staff, and carry books ordered via interlibrary loan from place to place. The library cut the equivalent of two and a half staff members, however.
The State Library “remains committed to supporting public library staff through continuing education,” Wednesday’s news release said, and “future training opportunities will evolve to meet changing needs and circumstances across the state.”

Jason Knight and Jon Thorp, have announced they will run in the special Republican primary to fill the vacancy created by U.S/ Rep. Mark Green's resignation. (Knight photo: Montgomery County Commission; Thorp photo: Jon Thorp for TN-7 Facebook)Two combat veterans are joining the race to replace outgoing Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green, while a former political operative is considering a candidacy for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District seat.
Springfield resident Jon Thorp and Maj. Jason Knight of Clarksville, both veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns, announced they are entering the field as Republicans. 
A special election is to be held for the seat after Green said this week he will step down as soon as the House votes on President Donald Trump’s budget plan.
They join Tennessee Department of General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, who reportedly left his post, in announcing their candidacy this week.
In addition, Michael Lotfi, deputy state director of Americans for Prosperity, said he is considering entering the race. Lotfi sparked outrage among Tennessee lawmakers six years ago when they found out former House Speaker Glen Casada put him on the state payroll as a political operative.
Thorp, an officer in the U.S. Army on multiple tours of duty, is billing himself as a political outsider under the “Liberty Reset” movement in which he’s calling for “fiscal sanity,” congressional and bureaucratic term limits and full audits of government agencies.
Potential replacements for Tennessee U.S. Rep. Green line up

“This isn’t about filling a seat. It’s about flipping the script,” Thorp said in a statement. “For too long, Washington has served lobbyists, not Tennesseans. This is our moment to choose a different kind of leadership – one that values honesty over polish, accountability over party loyalty, and courage over careerism.”
Thorp acknowledged he hasn’t voted in 24 years because he didn’t like candidates from either major political party but said he is entering the race as children are being “handed a collapsing economy, weaponized bureaucracy and a rigged political class that serves donors instead of voters.”
Knight, a Montgomery County commissioner and former Clarksville City Council member who served nine years with the 101st Airborne Division, said he is running because “President Trump needs reinforcements” and “backups” in Congress.
“From lawless rioters in California to obstructionists in Congress to far-left governors like Gavin Newsom, it is clear that an extreme out-of-touch minority is trying to stop President Trump and the America First policies that he is fighting for,” Knight said in a statement.
Knight described himself as a “staunch constitutionalist and a proven conservative” who would support increased border security and efforts to deport “criminals” who have no permanent legal documentation.
In a statement to the Tennessee Lookout, Lotfi admitted he would be a “pretty flawed candidate” but said he is honest, “if that counts for anything anymore.”
If no candidate emerges who will try to cut wasteful spending and return the federal government to its original “scale and scope,” Lotfi said he would enter the race.
“Voters want bottom-up solutions that will empower them. They want to reclaim the American dream,” he said.
Others considering running for the post are Republican state Sen. Bill Powers of Clarksville, Republican state Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson and former Republican state Rep. Brandon Ogles of Brentwood. Those drawing mentions are House Speaker Cameron Sexton, state Rep. Gino Bulso and Chris Burger, a Tennessee political operative.

On the Democratic side, state Rep. Vincent Dixie of Nashville confirmed he is considering running.
“I’ve had a lot of support and phone calls from people I respect who have asked me to run,” said Dixie. “I am seriously contemplating running for District 7: I’m about 98.3% sure that this is what I want to do.”
Sen. Charlane Oliver told the Lookout she is not interested in a congressional run at this time. 
“I take it very seriously,” Oliver said. “It’s not just an opportunity, it’s a life change. I’m honored and flattered that people would consider me.”
Others being floated are former Nashville Mayors Megan Barry and John Cooper, state Rep. John Ray Clemmons, former Tennessee State University President Glenda Glover and Darden Copeland, founder of Nashville-based land use consulting firm Calvert Street Group.
In a statement, Barry said, “Green has announced his resignation before so let’s see if he actually follows through. I’m still taking it all in and don’t want to enter into this lightly.”
“I’ve been talking with my family and advisors and will make a decision when the time is right.”
Clemmons told the Lookout that Democrats must unite behind a single candidate, but did not indicate whether he will run. 
State Rep. Bo Mitchell and state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, all of whom have been mentioned as potential candidates, did not respond to requests for comment from the Lookout.

Adrian Smith, R-Neb, in a Republican primary.","David Huebner of North Platte says his background in agriculture gives him an advantage against U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb. (Courtesy of David Huebner for Congress)LINCOLN — A former U.S. Border Patrol agent has decided to run for Congress in Nebraska’s largely rural, sprawling 3rd Congressional District. 
North Platte native David Huebner will try to do what other Republicans in the district haven’t and beat U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb, in a Republican primary. Huebner said he is running to bring some “energy back” to the seat.
“I like active and present representation,” Huebner said, “I don’t feel like we have that right now from the incumbent.” 
Huebner said Smith lacks a background in agriculture, and the district wants someone with that background who can advocate for rural issues. He said the issues potential voters have brought up so far are the need for increased border security and improving the agricultural economy. 
Huebner acknowledges he’s an underdog but said he wants to give voters a choice.
“I’m getting out, meeting people … finding out what’s important to them,” Huebner said. “Life is very different in western rural Nebraska than it is in D.C. It’s very easy to get out of touch up there.”  
Smith, from Gering, has represented the district since 2007. Before Congress, Smith served in the Legislature from 1999 to 2007. He is on the House Ways and Means Committee, which is Congress’s chief tax-writing committee. 
The 3rd District includes central and western Nebraska and much of the state’s northeastern and southeastern edges. It’s one of the nation’s most conservative congressional districts by political party registration advantage and voting record. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in the district by 197,650 voters, according to data maintained by the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office. 
Smith having a GOP primary opponent is nothing new. He has had at least one primary opponent in every election since 2018 and has never gotten less than 65% of the GOP primary vote. In 2018, he faced three Republican opponents, including current State Board of Education member Kirk Penner. Smith faced four GOP challengers in 2020.

Huebner said he differs from previous Smith opponents because he is an active agricultural producer growing hay and raising Black Angus cattle. 
A Smith campaign spokesperson said the congressman is a “proven and trusted conservative fighting for Nebraskans alongside President [Donald] Trump,” focusing on issues such as border security and making the Trump tax cuts permanent.
“Adrian has a conservative record that reflects the priorities of Nebraska’s Third District,” said Chris Peterson, speaking for Smith’s campaign

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)State election regulators decertified all three members of the Searcy County Election Commission on Wednesday over allegations the commission accepted equipment in violation of state rules.
The decertification means the election commissioners cannot work in any official election capacity for 14 years.
The State Board of Election Commissioners, per its rules, did not identify Searcy County or the election officials by name as it reviewed 10 possible violations of state election law and regulations, but election commissioners from Searcy County attended the meeting and confirmed afterward they were the subject of the board’s actions. 
Searcy County was the only county to count ballots by hand last year. The county’s election officials used audiovisual equipment —  television monitors, cameras and scanners — provided by the Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative to help observers monitor the vote counting, according to the board discussion. The nonprofit Voter Integrity Initiative unsuccessfully sued the state last year to get approval of a ballot measure that would require all elections in Arkansas to be conducted by hand-counted paper ballots.
The state election board also sanctioned Searcy County last October over issues involved in its hand count during the March 2024 primaries.
Chris Madison, director of the state election board, lauded the county’s efforts to be transparent, but said his staff had difficulty getting records from officials documenting what he described as an equipment purchase. 
Only after the staff’s investigative report had been finalized at the beginning of this month did it receive an invoice from the county election commission that showed it had been billed $100 for the equipment, Madison said. 
Board member Jamie Clemmer said that receiving donated equipment from Arkansas Voter Integrity Initiative seemed questionable, “especially by somebody that has a vested interest in these sorts of elections.”
Arkansas election board to sanction county officials over issues with hand-counted ballots

Madison said his staff didn’t examine the ethics of the donation, only whether it was properly documented and compensated. 
Laura Gross, the chair of the Searcy County Election Commission, said in an interview after the meeting that the equipment was a one-day rental, not a purchase, and that the same terms were available to other counties as well. She disputed that there was any kind of “quid pro quo” or under the table dealing for the equipment. She said she didn’t know what the voter integrity group’s history was and that she “was trying to be a good steward of my budget.”
The county election commission also hadn’t been provided with a copy of the complaint against it, Gross said, which she said is a requirement under the board’s rules.
“It’s almost like they’re looking for something wrong,” Gross said, adding later that, “this is an out-of-control commission, and you can quote me on that.”
Gross said she doesn’t plan on contesting her decertification, while the other two commissioners told the Advocate they were undecided. Gross said she served on the county election commission as a public service. The the effort required to keep doing so wasn’t worth it, she said, as she believed the outcome of the state board’s investigation was predetermined based on the way members treated her and poll workers from Drew County on Wednesday.
The board voted to issue letters of caution to two Drew County election workers after it found the women had violated electioneering laws by asking a man to remove a pin with a graphic of former President Joe Biden’s face and the words “Weak Men Create Hard Time” prior to voting. 
The man left the polling place upset after “snatching” back his ID in response to the request. He was allowed to vote the following day after the state election commission clarified that wearing the pin was not electioneering since Biden was not on the ballot. 
In addition to decertifying the Searcy County election commissioners, the state election board also sanctioned other Searcy County election workers. A poll supervisor was given a letter of caution after a board-trained poll monitor overheard her saying she had “talked voters out of” casting provisional ballots. Another poll worker overheard expressing support for the casino ballot measure was decertified.
Additionally, the board voted to hold a hearing on July 16 for a poll worker who is contesting a previous board decertification vote. 
Clarification: This story has been updated to specify what audiovisual equipment was provided and clarify the dispute over whether it was a purchase, donation or rental.

(Getty Images)Two members of the Louisiana Public Defender Oversight Board have resigned just 14 months into what were supposed to be four-year terms on the new governing body Gov. Jeff Landry created. 
Freddie Pitcher Jr., a former state appellate judge in Baton Rouge who also ran Southern University’s law school, and Shreveport attorney Ted Hernandez are leaving the board. Their decisions to step down come shortly before the board expects to have a contentious vote Monday about the dismissal of five attorneys who run local public defender offices. 
Pitcher, who Landry appointed to the board, said he is leaving because he is having personal issues that have been exacerbated by the board having “too much drama.” Hernandez, who was Senate President Cameron Henry’s appointee, sent a short resignation letter to Landry at the end of last month. 

“Serving on the board has been a learning experience,” wrote Hernandez, who could not be reached Wednesday by phone or email for additional comment. 

The nine-member board helps supervise Louisiana’s sprawling public defense system with 37 local offices and approximately 850 attorneys. Public defenders represent 146,000 people annually and 88% of all criminal defendants in Louisiana. 

Last year, Landry pushed through a controversial change in state law that dissolved the previous state public defender board and replaced it with the current, weaker version over which the governor has more influence. 
State Public Defender Rémy Starns lobbied Landry for the new board after clashing over policy with the previous one. Starns has been the leader of the public defender system since former Gov. John Bel Edwards appointed him in 2020. Landry and the newly-formed board agreed last year to keep him in the position. 

Yet the new board and Starns have had some of the same disagreements he had with the old board. 

The new board has voted down Starns’ proposals to reduce the pay of most chief public defenders who run local offices and incentivize some to operate part-time, private law practices on top of their state responsibilities. He also wanted to offer additional money to chiefs who agreed to represent more clients personally in court. 

In February, Starns caused controversy when he told five chief public defenders who run local offices they would be losing their jobs on July 1 after their state contracts expire. The attorneys have appealed those terminations to the board, which is expected to decide Monday whether they will be terminated.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The chief public defenders affected are Michelle AndrePont in Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson in Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller in Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward of Evangeline Parish and John Hogue, who works in Tensas, Madison and East Carroll parishes. 
All five have been among the most critical of Starns’ policies in public. Over the past few years, they have testified at legislative hearings and public defender board meetings to oppose Starns’ efforts to remake the public defender board and curb their pay. They argue Starns targeted them for dismissal because they have spoken out against him. 

“If in fact these terminations are due in whole or in part to the participation of these District Defenders in the legislative process or Board meetings, then it is beyond question that the independence of the indigent defense function is under attack,” wrote Stephen Haedicke, an attorney representing the lawyers.
Starns did not respond to phone calls and text messages asking for comment Wednesday.

A special subcommittee of the public defender board has recommended the board uphold Starns’ decision to fire the attorneys. It concluded Starns had the authority not to renew the public defender chiefs’ one-year contracts. 

“Mr. Starns had no obligation to enter into new contracts with these defenders,” Paul deMahy, a retired state court judge and board member who chaired the subcommittee, wrote in a memo last month. 

Pitcher also sat on the subcommittee and said his perspective was more nuanced. He agreed with deMahy that Starns had the legal authority to dismiss the five attorneys, but he wanted to recommend that the governor keep them in their jobs anyway.

“He has a technical win there. But from a moral standpoint, they should have their jobs back,” Pitcher said Wednesday. 
The attorneys are also challenging the subcommittee’s recommendation by saying an April hearing on the dismissals violated the state’s public notice and open meetings laws for government entities.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX 
While the review of the attorneys’ terminations was taking place over the last two months, Starns had also asked the Louisiana Legislature to approve two more bills that would have increased his authority further. The legislation stalled, however, after state lawmakers expressed concern Starns was trying to work around the new public defender board set up just last year. 

Starns is also asking the 30-plus remaining chief public defenders who run local offices to waive their rights to challenge their dismissal and compensation if they want to keep their jobs, according to a copy of the contract provided by a public defender, who asked not to be named because of fear of retaliation. 
The new one-year contracts Starns has sent to chief public defenders require the attorneys to forgo the compensation plan the public defender oversight board set for one Starns has implemented. He would also be able to fire them at any time without cause with 30 days notice, and the attorneys would no longer be able to appeal to the board for a reversal of that decision.

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)The Trump administration last week released revised rules for a federal program meant to widely expand broadband access, stripping the Biden-era effort of many key requirements and making it easier for Elon Musk’s company to win grants.
Under the revised guidelines, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, will take a technology-neutral approach to expanding broadband access rather than focusing on fiber internet. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability and ability to reach remote locations.
The change opens the door for more internet providers to use BEAD grants for technologies including satellite internet service, which is provided by Elon Musk’s Starlink. Under the new rules, Starlink could receive $10 billion to $20 billion in BEAD money, up from $4.1 billion the company would have received under the original rules, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Groups applying for BEAD funding also will no longer be required to offer a low-cost service option for internet users in locations they are serving. Some states had proposed services as low as $30 a month.
Instead, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration now encourages internet providers to propose their “existing, market driven low-cost plans” to meet the cost requirement.
Digital grant program halted by Trump administration, state says

As part of the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within the government, the new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment and climate change also were cut.
And the agency eliminated a provision of the original program that encouraged states to seek out non-traditional providers, including municipalities or political subdivisions that provide internet service.
Louisiana’s, Nevada’s and Delaware’s proposals, which had been approved, will be rescinded.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick promised to launch a rigorous review of the BEAD program in March, saying in a statement that because of “woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies and burdensome regulations, the program has not connected a single person to the internet and is in dire need of a readjustment.”
In April, the Trump administration gave states an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the $42.45 billion program in anticipation of the changes, further delaying an effort that’s set to go back to the planning phase after more than three years.
Evan Feinman, the former director of the BEAD program, said states will now have to rework their proposals again.
“For some reason, [Secretary] Lutnick, who said the program was going too slowly, wants to slow the program down much more, force states and the private sector to do a ton of extra work and spend a bunch of extra taxpayer money all so we can get worse connections to people that will cost them more every month,” he said.
The Internet & Television Association, a trade association representing the broadband and cable industries, praised the new guidelines in a statement, saying, “We welcome changes to the BEAD program that will make the program more efficient and eliminate onerous requirements, which add unnecessary costs that impede broadband deployment efforts.”
But Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said in a statement that the changes will “cement the digital divide for decades.” The Benton Institute is a nonprofit organization championing digital access for all.
“[Lutnick] is hurting our economic competitiveness, our healthcare and education, and our ability to work and stay connected with loved ones,” Garner said in the statement. “He is denying rural Americans access to the modern economy and our increasingly connected world.”

And why can't anyone find out the details of how that decision was made? |Getty Images CreativeThe State Bar of Wisconsin was created by the Wisconsin Supreme Court as the trade association that all Wisconsin lawyers must join to obtain their law licenses. Its vision statement declares its cardinal purpose: “Our members are the respected guardians of the dignity and integrity of the rule of law within a fair and accessible justice system.” 
Yet recently, State Bar leaders deliberately violated their own vision statement by refusing in any way to push back against President Donald Trump’s blatantly illegal executive orders attacking lawyers, without whom the rule of law cannot exist “within a fair and accessible justice system.” Why they shirked their express mission remains a mystery because State Bar leaders voted in secrecy on the issue and refused to explain themselves to the 25,000 State Bar members they purportedly serve. Instead, they have stonewalled membership with a bogus cone of silence over their deliberations.
Here is the context:
Earlier this Spring, President Donald Trump issued punitive executive orders targeting 14 prominent law firms because he didn’t like their lawyers, clients, cases, or speech. He acted to cripple their ability to provide legal services to their clients. Trump then offered these firms an extortionate “deal” he thought they couldn’t refuse: agree to provide millions of dollars in pro bono legal work to further Trump’s political agenda, such as free work for the coal industry, or else lose security clearances, access to federal buildings and even government contracts held by their clients.  
Several of the firms capitulated, offering roughly $1 billion in legal services to Trump that otherwise would have funded true “pro bono” work for the underserved. Several others, including Perkins Coie, a distinguished national firm with Wisconsin members, refused. They fought back in court, and won.
Their wins are unsurprising. The U.S. Constitution undeniably bars our government from wielding its power to target lawyers based on their representation of clients, their employment decisions, or their advocating positions the administration doesn’t like.
Federal courts have been unanimous and unsparing in condemning Trump’s orders. One judge characterized such an order as a “personal vendetta” by Trump  that “the framers of our Constitution would see…as a shocking abuse of power.”
Retired conservative federal judge J. Michael Luttig commented that executive orders targeting law firms are “the most sinister and corrupt” of the “ocean of unconstitutional orders” coming out of the White House. He correctly emphasized that the legality of the executive orders is beside the point for Trump, who knows that no court will uphold them. The purpose, rather, is to intimidate lawyers.
Wisconsin lawyers are officers of the court, sworn to support the Constitution of the United States. We are thus duty-bound to guard the Constitution against existential hazards like Trump’s illegitimate orders. The rule of law requires no less.
Because the State Bar, through its governing board, is uniquely positioned to speak on issues of universal concern to all lawyers, we and others have repeatedly urged the Bar to honor its vision statement and publicly condemn Trump’s orders. Various versions of a statement supporting the rule of law have been offered for the board of governors’ consideration and adoption, statements that no reasonable lawyer could find objectionable while remaining true to the lawyer’s oath. 
We are not asking a lot. Already the State Bar—once a national leader in advancing the rule of law—is woefully behind many other respected lawyer organizations. On March 26, 2025, for example, the American Bar Association was joined by more than a hundred other lawyer organizations in a public statement specifically rejecting “the notion that the U.S. government can punish lawyers and law firms who represent certain clients…”
The ABA statement continued: “There are clear choices facing our profession. We can choose to remain silent and allow these acts to continue or we can stand for the rule of law and the values we hold dear. We call upon the entire profession… to speak out against intimidation.”
On May 22, we were informed by a single member of the Wisconsin State Bar board of governors that the board met in closed session May 14, and “following extensive discussion protected by the attorney-client privilege, the Board voted to make no statement concerning recent actions taken by the Executive Branch of the federal government.”
That’s all we know because board members also voted to remain silent on what occurred during the closed meeting, for reasons they will also not disclose. Newly-elected members of the board of governors taking office July 1 will be barred from learning more about the May 14 closed meeting until they first take a vow of silence on what they may learn even though they are instructed by their position description to “[c]ommunicate regularly with constituents,” and to “[b]e well versed in the State Bar’s public policy positions and be prepared to explain them to…members of the bar.”
We have since asked 12 representatives on the board several questions about what happened in secret and why. Only three replied, but they provided little information. We still don’t know: (1) why the question was taken up in closed session, (2) why State Bar leaders needed legal counsel to advise whether the Bar should issue a statement supporting the rule of law, (3) what was discussed, (4) why no statement was issued, and (5) what was the final vote. 
We asked State Bar leadership and staff to forward our questions to all 52 members of the board but, despite an agreement to do so, the questions were not sent. We still have no answers.
More than 400 years ago Shakespeare highlighted the tyrant’s tactic for thwarting the rule of law: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” Federal District Judge Beryl Howell invoked Shakespeare’s warning in her scathing takedown of the executive order targeting Perkins Coie, further observing that when American history is written, “those who stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the models lauded.” 
The success of Trump’s intimidation campaign depends largely on whether lawyers forcefully resist his illegal bullying at every opportunity. Thus, the State Bar’s cowering non-response bodes ill for the rule of law in Wisconsin. As the American Bar Association stated: “If the lawyers do not speak…who will protect the bedrock of justice?”

Up for discussion was the Marshall BlueOval Battery Park. Announced in 2023, the $3.5 billion project was initially expected to create 2,500 jobs, though Republicans have raised alarms about the project due to a licensing agreement between plant-owner Ford and a Chinese battery company.
Earlier this year, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. or CATL – who has agreed to license its battery technology to Ford for production at the facility – was placed on the U.S. Department of Defense’s list of “Chinese military companies” found to be operating directly or indirectly within the U.S. As a result the company is barred from entering contracts with the Department of Defense.
When Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin rejected Ford’s bid to establish the plant in his state due to its ties to CATL, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said he made a political determination and emphasized that Michigan would continue to compete for every economic opportunity. She later celebrated when Michigan was selected as the site for the project calling it a “generational investment.”
While the Michigan Economic Development Corporation was aware of the project’s ties to CATL prior to awarding funding to Blue Oval for the project, the Chinese company’s involvement was not a secret, the corporation’s Chief Operating and Performance Officer Christin Armstrong said. 
Armstrong and the corporation’s Senior Project Marketing Advisor Josh Hundt each noted China’s near-monopoly on battery technology, with Ford aiming to bring that technology to the U.S. to break their control of the electric vehicle market.

However, members of the committees questioned why the automaker hadn’t simply partnered with companies from non-hostile nations like Japan or South Korea instead. 
Ford did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
While it would greatly benefit the U.S. to develop its own technology to boost America’s electric vehicle manufacturing, the Economic Development Corporation views the project as a way for Ford to make its vehicles more competitive, providing it with access to battery technology and employment for American workers, Hundt said.
With U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) introducing legislation to subject vehicles and vehicle parts manufactured in countries of concern like China to a security review, Rep. Luke Meerman (R-Coopersville) asked whether concerns at the national level factored into the economic development corporation’s decision making.
Hundt explained that by utilizing CATL’s tech, Ford avoids the alternative of importing batteries from China, allowing the automaker to reduce its dependency on China and other foreign manufacturers.
“Our role is to help make sure that we are seeing a disruption of this current Chinese monopoly that, frankly, nobody wants to see,” Hundt said. “We need to see both the technology and the manufacturing take place here, and this is a way to begin to make that happen.”
Joe Cella, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Fiji during President Donald Trump’s first term, raised further concerns about potential threats from the Chinese government.
“I will preface my remarks by stating that China is on the hunt, and our footing nationally and the states is not commensurate with this threat,” Cella said, referencing three Chinese citizens with ties to the University of Michigan who were arrested for smuggling biological agents into the country.

He pointed to requirements in Chinese law demanding Chinese-based companies, no matter where they are located, to surveil, collect and report as directed.
“In other words, conduct espionage,” Cella said, previously noting that CATL had begun hiring for positions at the Marshall plant through its U.S.-based subsidiary.
Should this deal ever come to fruition in Michigan, it would only be a matter of time until espionage begins, Cella said, noting that Battle Creek Air National Guard Base and Fort Custer are located nearby. 
Alongside questions on Ford’s deal with CATL, Armstrong and Hundt fielded questions on the specifics of the project following Ford’s decision to downsize the effort. 
Now expected to deliver 1,700 jobs rather than 2,500, Armstrong said the project is still underway, with plans to wrap construction and start hiring by 2026.

Steve Scalise's office at Heritage Plaza in Metairie on May 22, 2025. (Katie Jane Fernelius/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – For Harold John, a job with the federal government meant a more stable, comfortable life than the one he knew as a child.
John grew up in the Melpomene Projects with his three sisters. Neither of his parents, both of who had grown up on rural farms in Louisiana, had obtained more than an elementary school education. John was able to finish high school, join the U.S. Navy and then get a job with the U.S. Postal Service, all of which helped carry him into the middle class in the 1980s.
But today, the now-retired letter carrier is concerned that that same pathway may not be available to young people growing up in similar circumstances.
That is because the second Trump administration has set its sights on dismantling the federal workforce, especially through the slash-and-cut measures of the Department of Government Efficiency, which until recently was led by Elon Musk. In its first few months, DOGE had already targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and initiated mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies, which, some allege, have disproportionately impacted women and people of color.
The U.S. Postal Service has not yet been subject to the same types of abrupt and indiscriminate cuts seen at agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development or the Department of Education but DOGE has its sights set on the post office, which worries John.
“There’s been a dedicated narrative from the right that federal workers aren’t necessary for a long time,” John said. “This is not the first time that they’ve come after the postal service or federal unions, but it’s the most disastrous and dangerous time.”
The U.S. Postal Service is highly diverse. As of 2023, 45% of postal employees were racial minorities. Though Black people make up about 14% of the total U.S. population, 30% of postal workers that year were Black.
To John, who is Black, that diversity is one of the Postal Service’s greatest strengths.
“That was one of the better things about having a federal job: you knew they weren’t going to discriminate when it came to hiring,” John said.
There are approximately 34,000 federal employees in Louisiana, 38% of whom identify as Black – the second-highest share of Black federal workers among the states, behind only Georgia. This trend is consistent across most of the South. In Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Tennessee, at least one-third of federal workers are Black.
Part of the reason Black people are overrepresented in federal workers in the South is due to the fact of demographics: There are more Black people in the South.
But Gary Hoover, an economist at Tulane University, said that overrepresentation of Black people in the federal workforce also has to do with the fact that public sector work is one of the few on-ramps to the middle class for historically marginalized communities of color, especially in the South.
“You have to go back nearly 60 years to … the Civil Rights Act in 1964, where employment discrimination became a federal offense,” Hoover said. “There’s the creation of the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] that looks into unfair hiring and labor practices. And with the creation of the EEOC, the federal government becomes a leader in fair hiring practices – not by doing anything particularly progressive, just by actually upholding the law as it is written in regards to employment.”
At that time, many Black workers, especially educated Black workers, struggled to get hired or be promoted within the private sector due to widespread racial biases. This was not only the case in white-collar and professional industries, but also in skilled blue-collar industries.
Especially since the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, public sector work, notably with the federal government, has provided an opportunity for upward mobility for Black workers. It was also a workforce that was rapidly becoming more unionized following a 1962 executive order by President John F. Kennedy granting federal workers the right to engage in collective bargaining
In Louisiana and across the South, a unionized job with the federal government was a good job – and one that ultimately helped build the Black middle class, Hoover said.
“Once I have job security, I can start thinking about buying a home,” Hoover said. “Once I start thinking about buying a home, I’m thinking about stable communities. Once I have a stable community, then I can start thinking seriously about the future and intergenerational wealth transfers.”

‘Nobody is living high on the hog’
On a recent steamy afternoon in May, a group of protesters gathered outside Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise’s Metairie office. The protest, which was organized by the grassroots organization Step Up Louisiana, featured about two dozen people decked out in union garb, holding picket signs above their heads. Marching in a circle outside the 18-floor Heritage Plaza office tower, the protesters took turns leading raucous chants.
“Step Up,” one protester shouted.
“For federal workers!” the rest replied.
“Step Up,” went another call.
“For U.S. Mail,” came the response.
The protest had been organized in response to a Trump-championed budget reconciliation bill, called the  “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which, as drafted, would significantly cut assistance for Medicaid and food stamps. Scalise was set to vote on the bill that same day (May 22). (He ultimately would vote in favor, along with 214 of his colleagues, and help the bill pass the U.S. House of Representatives.)
The group outside Scalise’s office included a contingent of current and former federal workers — all of them Black — who were also protesting DOGE’s cuts to the federal workforce.
Terrence Johns, a current employee of the National Finance Office, a New Orleans-based federal office that manages payroll and personnel across multiple federal agencies, stepped up and spoke into the megaphone.
“Here in the South, you know there’s largely a minority population that makes up these government service jobs,” Johns said, noting that his own office was majority Black. “Believe me, brothers and sisters, everything that comes out of this administration attacks Black and Brown people.”
Johns, who has also served as the longtime president of a local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees union, said that both federal jobs and social welfare — necessary to sustaining the people of the Deep South — have been gutted since the Reagan administration.
“Don’t believe the rhetoric,” he added. “Nobody is living high on the hog. But these are decent jobs and have always set the standard for American workers.”
‘It is just so disheartening’
When John started at the Postal Service in 1985, that there were a small number of good, unionized jobs across the greater New Orleans area, such as at the Avondale Shipyard and the port, John said. But apart from those, the best opportunities were in unionized public sector work. Many educated Black people like him found opportunities with the federal government at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (then known as the Veterans Administration), or at the nearby NASA Michoud facility. Or with the Postal Service.
“We had a definite economic impact on New Orleans,” he said, referring to the Black middle class that was emerging through public sector work.
Troy Lee Davis, another Postal Service employee in New Orleans, grew up in the Desire Projects before moving to New Orleans East. His dad, who had served in World War II, worked in construction while his mom worked as a housemaid and cook. Davis, like his father before him, joined the military, which helped pay for college at the University of New Orleans. After that, he got a job as a mail handler.
“This was one of the better-paying jobs in New Orleans,” Davis said, adding that the job came with benefits, paid time off, holidays and regular cost-of-living adjustments. “So, it was a big opportunity for anybody coming from poverty to get to have a comfortable lifestyle.”
Being part of the Postal Service has a long, storied reputation among Black communities because it was one of the earliest available public sector jobs – and one that paid decent wages.
But these days, both John and Davis are worried that the second Trump administration may unravel the gains that post office and other federal employees have made.
In March, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy entered into an agreement with DOGE, allowing the team to find “further efficiencies” in the postal service, targeting a specific list of issues, including the management of retirement plans, workers’ compensation costs, lease renewals and counterfeit postage. He also said he would seek to cut 10,000 of the Postal Service’s 600,000-plus employees through early retirement offers.  (DeJoy resigned later that same month.)
However, some worry that the DOGE partnership, along with Trump’s pick of a FedEx board member to lead the USPS, means that the Postal Service may soon be privatized – an idea that Trump and Musk have expressed support for in the past.
“I’ve seen all the progress that was made during my lifetime destroyed in less than one hundred days,” John said. “It is just so disheartening to see it all gone, pretty much overnight.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Hundreds marched in southeast Baltimore Wednesday to protest what they say is the detention of at least 16 people in the region by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the last three weeks, after raids at grocery stores, convenience shops and a Home Depot.
The peaceful protest and march was led by CASA, a nonprofit that provides support services for immigrants and advocates on their behalf.
“ICE out of Maryland! ICE out of Baltimore!” they chanted to drumbeats, as passersby peered from windows and rowhouse steps, often filming with their cell phones, sometimes cheering with the crowd.
“We have seen a spike in the Baltimore region — and our surrounding area — of raids,” said Crisaly De Los Santos, CASA’s Baltimore and Central Maryland director, during a news conference Wednesday. “These raids are not isolated incidents. They are an assault on our immigrant families, on working-class neighborhoods and the dignity of Baltimore as a whole.”
The protestors marched from CASA’s Baltimore Welcome Center on Pulaski Highway to two locations that organizers say were the site of ICE activity: a Royal Farms on East Fayette Street and the Hazlo International Foods store on East Lombard Street.

Baltimore Police vehicles blocked traffic along the route to let marchers proceed through the streets. CASA officials estimated the crowd at about 400 people.
As the crowd passed on East Fayette Street near her home,  María Flores was moved to tears. She said that seeing the demonstrators filled her with joy, during a challenging time for her community.
“We are very scared for those without papers,” she said in Spanish.
The raids come as President Donald Trump has made good on his campaign promise to speed deportations of undocumented migrants.
In March, Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration officials and deported to El Salvador, despite having court protection against removal to his home country since 2019. He was held in prison there for months, despite court orders — including from the U.S. Supreme Court — for the Trump administration to bring him home.
His detention sparked a firestorm, heightened when Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D- Md.) went to El Salvador to meet with Abrego Garcia. He was finally brought back last week to Tennessee, where he will be tried on federal charges of conspiracy to unlawfully transport undocumented people for profit in connection with a 2022 traffic stop there.
Protests against ICE detentions in Los Angeles prompted Trump to send in California National Guard troops and Marines, against the wishes of California officials who said the actions threatened to inflame the situation. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sued Trump, who in turn threatened Newsom with arrest.
On Wednesday in Baltimore, CASA officials said that ICE officers struck a child during a June 8 confrontation with a Baltimore City resident near a grocery store with his wife, three children and 80-year-old mother, according to a CASA news release.

“With videos and witnesses sharing, we can see that his young son was assaulted in the process, leaving him with blood all over his face,” De Los Santos said at Wednesday’s news conference.
ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations Wednesday afternoon.
Perla Hernández, a community organizer with CASA, said she witnessed a man arrested by ICE agents inside a Baltimore County shopping center “as he was shopping for items for his daughter’s birthday,” she said in Spanish through an interpreter. “Violently, three ICE agents threw him down to the ground, ignoring his pleas and asks to see a warrant signed by a judge.”
The May 20 arrests at the Home Depot along Eastern Avenue on May 20 were also jarring, De Los Santos said. Five day laborers were “chased, tackled and forcibly abducted,” she said. Days later, men in ski masks came back to the same location and arrested four additional immigrants, she said.
“That day, five families were torn apart,” said Julia Fernandez, a CASA member.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“A man providing for eight family members — including six children under the age of 10 — was abducted, leaving traumatized children behind, and his niece, recently recovering from surgery, without their father figure,” Fernandez said.
Several state and local lawmakers flanked CASA staffers and spoke out against the ICE arrests at the news conference, including Del. Robbyn Lewis (D- Baltimore City), who represents East Baltimore’s District 46. She cited policy changes lawmakers have approved for migrants, such as expanded access to the earned income tax credit and access to Medicaid for pregnant women, regardless of immigration status. But she said there is only so much legislators can do.
“Right now, as a state legislator — it’s hard to say this — but I actually have limited power to impact what’s done at the federal level,” Lewis said.

Lawmakers this year were unable to pass a law banning so-called 287(g) agreements, which essentially let local police act as immigration agents. Instead, they passed a bill educating immigrants and property owners on how to respond if ICE agents show up in “sensitive locations” like churches, courthouses or hospitals.
Lewis said the ICE detentions resonate powerfully with her as the descendant of African Americans who escaped slavery with the help of abolitionists.
“The tactics that are being used today to terrorize our neighborhood residents — Marylanders — have been used and perfected in this country, used against African Americans and those abolitionists who went out of their way, with their faith and their strong morality, to help us,” Lewis said.
Baltimore City Councilman Mark Parker, a pastor who was elected last year to represent the Southeast portion of the city, said he has been responding “for months now,” sometimes on a daily basis, to calls from residents affected by raids. He spoke of talking with family members, visiting their homes and traveling to the George H. Fallon Federal Building in Baltimore.
Shortly after Parker took office in December, he said that some officials discussed laying low to avoid the scrutiny of the Trump administration.
“But that kind of rhetoric acts like our neighbors aren’t being attacked every single day already,” Parker said.
City Councilwoman Odette Ramos, who represents District 14, including Johns Hopkins University and Lake Montebello, said the raids and the harm they are causing immigrant communities is the “fault of this administration — the Trump administration.”

“Imagine — all of you here — that this is going to happen to your family,” Ramos said. “Planning for separation, planning to be gone and sent to a life that you escaped, but also that you don’t know, after investing so much into our nation and believing in the promise of the United States.”
During Wednesday’s demonstration, which lasted about two hours, marchers walked behind a burgundy CASA banner, with the message “Immigrant Power in Action,” wielding signs with messages like “Abolish ICE” and “Immigrants are Essential!” The crowd spanned a few city blocks, snaking through the streets of Baltimore
Demonstrators with megaphones led the crowd in chants, including: “Sí se puede,” and “Say it loud, say it clear: Immigrants are welcome here!”
Watching the marchers, resident Lizette Rodriguez pumped her fist. She isn’t an immigrant, she said, but she was moved by the demonstration.
“It’s inspiring,” she said. “They’re fighting for their rights.”
Southeast Baltimore resident Halal Henderson watched as the crowd arrived at the Royal Farms, where they knelt for a few moments, fists raised skyward.
“This is the land of the free,” Henderson said. “Why can’t they come over here and be free?”

Look closely at your mobile phone or tablet. Touch-screen technology, speech recognition, digital sound recording and the internet were all developed using funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation.
No matter where you live, NSF-supported research has also made your life safer. Engineering studies have reduced earthquake damage and fatalities through better building design. Improved hurricane and tornado forecasts reflect NSF investment in environmental monitoring and computer modeling of weather. NSF-supported resilience studies reduce risks and losses from wildfires.
Using NSF funding, scientists have done research that amazes, entertains and enthralls. They have drilled through mile-thick ice sheets to understand the past, visited the wreck of the Titanic and captured images of deep space.
NSF investments have made America and American science great. At least 268 Nobel laureates received NSF grants during their careers. The foundation has partnered with agencies across the government since it was created, including those dealing with national security and space exploration. The Federal Reserve estimates that government-supported research from the NSF and other agencies has had a return on investment of 150% to 300% since 1950, meaning for every dollar U.S. taxpayers invested, they got back between $1.50 and $3.
However, that funding is now at risk.
Since January, layoffs, leadership resignations and a massive proposed reorganization have threatened the integrity and mission of the National Science Foundation. Hundreds of research grants have been terminated. The administration’s proposed federal budget for fiscal year 2026 would cut NSF’s funding by 55%, an unprecedented reduction that would end federal support for science research across a wide range of discipines.
At my own geology lab, I have seen NSF grants catalyze research and the work of dozens of students who have collected data that’s now used to reduce risks from earthquakes, floods, landslides, erosion, sea-level rise and melting glaciers.
I have also served on advisory committees and review panels for the NSF over the past 30 years and have seen the value the foundation produces for the American people.
 American science’s greatness stemmed from war

In the 1940s, with the advent of nuclear weapons, the space race and the intensification of the Cold War, American science and engineering expertise became increasingly critical for national defense. At the time, most basic and applied research was done by the military.
Vannevar Bush, an electrical engineer who oversaw military research efforts during World War II, including development of the atomic bomb, had a different idea.
He articulated an expansive scientific vision for the United States in Science: The Endless Frontier. The report was a blueprint for an American research juggernaut grounded in the expertise of university faculty, staff and graduate students.
On May 10, 1950, after five years of debate and compromise, President Harry Truman signed legislation creating the National Science Foundation and putting Bush’s vision to work. Since then, the foundation has become the leading funder of basic research in the United States.
NSF’s mandate, then as now, was to support basic research and spread funding for science across all 50 states. Expanding America’s scientific workforce was and remains integral to American prosperity. By 1952, the foundation was awarding merit fellowships to graduate and postdoctoral scientists from every state.
There were compromises. Control of NSF rested with presidential appointees, disappointing Bush. He wanted scientists in charge to avoid political interference with the foundation’s research agenda.
 NSF funding matters to everyone, everywhere

Today, American tax dollars supporting science go to every state in the union.
The states with the most NSF grants awarded between 2011 and 2024 include several that voted Republican in the 2024 election – Texas, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania – and several that voted Democratic, including Massachusetts, New York, Virginia and Colorado.
More than 1,800 public and private institutions, scattered across all 50 states, receive NSF funding. The grants pay the salaries of staff, faculty and students, boosting local employment and supporting college towns and cities. For states with major research universities, those grants add up to hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Even states with few universities each see tens of millions of dollars for research.”

As NSF grant recipients purchase lab supplies and services, those dollars support regional and national economies.
When NSF budgets are cut and grants are terminated or never awarded, the harm trickles down and communities suffer. Initial NSF funding cuts are already rippling across the country, affecting both national and local economies in red, blue and purple states alike.
An analysis of a February 2025 proposal that would cut about US$5.5 billion from National Institutes of Health grants estimated the ripple effect through college towns and supply chains would cost $6.1 billion in GDP, or total national productivity, and over 46,000 jobs.
 An uncertain future for American science

America’s scientific research and training enterprise has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades. Yet, as NSF celebrates its 75th birthday, the future of American science is in doubt. Funding is increasingly uncertain, and politics is driving decisions, as Bush feared 80 years ago.
A list of grants terminated by the Trump administration, collected both from government websites and scientists themselves, shows that by early May 2025, NSF had stopped funding more than 1,400 existing grants, totaling over a billion dollars of support for research, research training and education.
 
Most terminated grants focused on education – the core of science, technology and engineering workforce development critical for supplying highly skilled workers to American companies. For example, NSF provided 1,000 fewer graduate student fellowships in 2025 than in the decade before − a 50% drop in support for America’s best science students.
American scientists are responding to NSF’s downsizing in diverse ways. Some are pushing back by challenging grant terminations. Others are preparing to leave science or academia. Some are likely to move abroad, taking offers from other nations to recruit American experts. Science organizations and six prior heads of the NSF are calling on Congress to step up and maintain funding for science research and workforce development.
If these losses continue, the next generation of American scientists will be fewer in number and less well prepared to address the needs of a population facing the threat of more extreme weather, future pandemics and the limits to growth imposed by finite natural resources and other planetary limits.
Investing in science and engineering is an investment in America. Diminishing NSF and the science it supports will hurt the American economy and the lives of all Americans.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)The threat that the Trump administration would illegally deploy military forces in Colorado to advance its authoritarian agenda has loomed over the state for months.
Now that the president has ordered troops into action against protests in California that local authorities insist were already under control, Colorado is increasingly at risk of similar federal incursions. But while the likelihood of such escalation has gone up, the state appears no better prepared to do anything to stop it.
Trump administration officials, including the president, have openly said since before the November election they would deploy military units for domestic law enforcement purposes, including immigration enforcement and against protesters. They weren’t bluffing.
In recent days, the administration deployed active duty Marines and thousands of California National Guard troops, against the will of the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, in response to protests in Los Angeles. Protesters object to the escalating and cruel tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as part of a mass deportation program.
Though some violence and vandalism has accompanied the protests, local authorities say they were mostly peaceful and that they can handle the situation without the help of war-trained fighters. But President Donald Trump appeared eager to pounce on this pretext. He used L.A. as a “test case for what happens when the federal government moves in and takes the authority away from the state, or away from local government,” said Mayor Karen Bass.
That means Colorado is on notice.

Trump during his campaign and in his second term in office often has singled out Colorado as a target for aggressive immigration enforcement. His administration has sued Colorado and Denver, alleging they have enacted unconstitutional “sanctuary” policies for immigrants, and ICE has conducted multiple raids and other operations in the state.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is commander-in-chief of the Colorado National Guard, in some instances has said he would not condone National Guard troops, from Colorado or another state, being used for immigration enforcement. Last month he said he would have “deep reservations” about such a deployment, a statement that fell short of a refusal. This week a spokesperson for Polis told Newsline that “the Governor has been clear that he would not support federal overreach to activate the National Guard outside of regular order.”
But if his preparation for a possible showdown over military deployments in Colorado goes beyond statements, it’s not public. In contrast, at least one other Democratic governor, Bob Ferguson in Washington, met with his state’s National Guard commander to discuss the situation in L.A. and how leaders could respond to such abuses in their state. 
And Polis’ posture on immigration abounds in contradiction. The Democrat has aligned himself with aspects of Trump’s mass deportation efforts. A state official this month alleged in a lawsuit that Polis improperly directed the state Labor Department to release the personal information of sponsors of unaccompanied immigrant children to ICE. Polis too often lets his inner MAGA show, and that leaves Colorado residents with little confidence he’ll effectively resist if Trump sics military forces against them.
A memo that Trump issued Saturday federalizing thousands of National Guard members and authorizing use of the regular military around ICE operations does not limit its scope to L.A., and it covers any “violence and disorder” that might “threaten to continue.”
ICE is preparing to escalate tactics, starting in five Democratically run locations — Seattle, Chicago, Philadelphia, Northern Virginia and New York — MSNBC reported Tuesday. Newsom, in a defiant televised address Tuesday, warned, “California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next.”
U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Democratic resident of Centennial, who represents a district that includes the ICE detention center in Aurora, sounded a similar warning this week.
“The President’s order doesn’t even mention California, and authorizes the use of ANY personnel, in ANY location, for ANY length of time,” Crow wrote on social media. “This is a dangerous slippery slope that should concern Americans everywhere.”
Meanwhile, Republican state representative and Colorado governor candidate Scott Bottoms promises to deploy military units against fellow Coloradans if he’s elected, and Trump sycophant U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Windsor has repeatedly cheered the domestic military deployments in California.
Opposition to ICE in Colorado is growing. On Tuesday, protesters clashed briefly with Denver police, who fired chemical munitions to clear a street and arrested 17 people. The presence of military units almost certainly would have exacerbated the conflict. And Coloradans have little assurance state leaders would do much to preclude a military presence in the first place.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)After Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger released her energy plan for the state this week, Virginia House GOP members wasted no time bashing it. Her plan emphasizes fair cost share, efficiency projects, and supporting a pilot program to handle peak energy consumption times.
“Her plan leans heavily on demand-side management: programmable thermostats, weatherization programs, utility subsidies, and incentives to reduce consumption during peak hours. That might sound reasonable in theory, but here’s the problem: managing scarcity isn’t a solution — it’s a symptom of failure,” an op-ed penned by House GOP leaders and members read.
The demand-side management they referenced is a recently-passed pilot program that requires utility companies to petition the State Corporation Commission to consider how to optimize energy use during peak times, by using virtual power plants, peak-shaving, and other incentives. Dominion is set to go before the Commission on July 15 to present its electric distribution grid plans for the pilot program.
The pilot allows homes and businesses to opt in to have their thermostats, appliances and solar arrays controlled during high-demand times. Spanberger’s plan also emphasizes weatherization of homes to limit energy waste and aims to reduce the need for additional power plants and transmission lines. Republican House lawmakers pushed back against those measures. 
“No one wants to sit through a July heatwave hoping their A/C unit is grid-compliant, or that their A/C won’t be the one that someone in Richmond decides that it needs to shut off to save the grid. No one should have to worry that peak-hour surcharges or remote-control thermostats are going to make their daily life harder and more expensive,” the Republican legislators’ letter read.
Ten of the GOP House members who signed on to the letter voted in favor of Senate Bill 1100 in this year’s legislative session, which allowed the pilot program to move forward. Dels. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, Wren Williams, R-Patrick, Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, Geary Higgins, R-Loudoun, Paul Milde, R-Stafford, Mark Earley, R-Chesterfield, Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack, Chad Green, R-York, and Anne Ferrell Tata, R-Virginia Beach, added their signatures to House GOP Leader Del. Terry Kilgore’s.
Kilgore, recently selected as House Republicans’ caucus leader, sponsored a bill in 2023 that capped Dominion’s profit margin, and this year, will allow the SCC to manage the profit margin rates. The General Assembly has also recently passed legislation aimed at expanding the state’s market for Small Modular Reactors, a nuclear energy source that’s still being developed and hasn’t yet been deployed anywhere in the United States.
Virginia lawmakers pass competing proposals to encourage small modular reactor development

A House GOP spokesperson said the members who voted in favor of SB 1011 are more interested in ramping up energy production in the state to meet increasing energy needs.
Spanberger’s plan doesn’t rule out new energy projects coming to the state to help meet demand, and touts the use of “advanced energy technologies” like “modular nuclear reactors, fusion, geothermal, and hydrogen.” The framework also states her administration will “ensure regulatory agencies in Virginia such as DEQ and VDOT are adequately staffed to deliver timely responses to permit applications.” The GOP letter said they are in favor of speeding up permitting for all energy sources, not just renewable ones.
Spanberger’s energy outline doesn’t go into details on plans to expand natural gas, nuclear, wind, or solar energy sources. It does lay out ideas to ensure the SCC works with stakeholders on efficiency methods to cut back on energy use – something the GOP members took issue with.
“You don’t solve an energy shortage by asking people to get used to less. You solve it by building more power,” the letter said.
Utility rates in the PJM markets have steadily increased in recent years as brownouts in the summer months have become a growing concern. Virginia was rated as the state that received the most electricity from other states in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. GOP House members want to shift away from this heavy import of energy and boost Virginia as a player in the energy production market.
In 2020, the General Assembly passed the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act that put the commonwealth into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Participating states can buy allowances of carbon emissions, and the proceeds are returned to the state for flood and energy projects. Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled Virginia from RGGI, framing the additional cost to consumers for the program as a hidden tax. The withdrawal was later found to be unlawful by the courts. The state’s inclusion in the program is on hold while appeals play out in the legal system.
Spanberger’s plan suggests negotiating a deal to get the state back in on RGGI and use funding for efficiency projects.
Judge deems Youngkin’s actions to withdraw Virginia from RGGI ‘unlawful’

“Abigail consistently hears from Virginians who are facing high energy bills, and she knows affordable energy is essential for driving economic growth. That’s why her plan to make Virginians’ energy bills more affordable includes increasing local electricity generation and speeding up the timeline to bring new projects online,” a spokesperson for Spanberger said in a statement. “As Governor, Abigail will be focused on making Virginia more affordable — and she looks forward to working with both Democrats and Republicans alike to make it happen.”
Last week, Republican candidate for governor Winsome Earle-Sears said on the campaign trail that she wants to bolster the state’s energy profile through expanding fossil fuels and nuclear energy, according to the Prince William Times, to meet the state’s surging energy needs. 
Data centers in Virginia have “substantially driven up energy demand in the state, and demand is forecast to continue growing for the foreseeable future,” a 2024 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission report found. Earle-Sears didn’t mention data centers specifically, but acknowledged that Virginia’s electricity demands have led the commonwealth to import 40% of its electricity from other states. Her administration, she said, would push for an all-of-the-above energy approach, an echo of Youngkin’s energy platform.
Earle-Sears did not respond to the Mercury’s request to elaborate on her energy platform.

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)After years of bureaucratic limbo, Virginia is set to receive $8.6 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation to support a slate of infrastructure projects that were first announced three years ago.
The funding comes as part of a national effort by the administration of former President Joe Biden to clear a backlog of 3,200 unobligated grants that had stalled “critical investments” in communities nationwide, according to the agency. The department said Tuesday it has now cleared 1,065 of those projects but did not explain why the grants were delayed in the first place.
Six awards are headed to Virginia, benefiting Ashland, Smithfield, Petersburg, Richmond and Salem. The Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation also received $5 million for Phase II of the Jamestown Scotland Ferry Facility Rehabilitation Project.
“While cynics in the press hysterically warned of doomsday delays, USDOT has been hard at work to get America building again,”  U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement. “We’ve done this by refocusing the department on core infrastructure – not enacting a radical political agenda. With a third of the last administration’s unprecedented backlog cleared, we will continue to rip out red tape roadblocks to get dirt moving.” 
Duffy said the agency is working “diligently” to distribute these “long-overdue” funds and prioritize core infrastructure projects. 
As part of the shift, the agency said it has eliminated several policies supported by the previous administration, including requirements tied to racial equity, climate change, and social justice. 
“Removing these requirements will save taxpayers millions,” the agency stated, citing increased road construction costs and mandates to report greenhouse gas emissions.
Among the Virginia recipients, the city of Richmond will receive $2 million — the second largest award in the state — for the Broad Rock Boulevard Grade Separation Study and Development. The project focuses on improving rail crossings with the goal of enhancing mobility by eliminating delays caused by blocked crossings.



 Awarded Grants

Town of Ashland – Ashland At-Grade Crossing Study – $421,200
City of Richmond – Broad Rock Boulevard Grade Separation Study and Development – $2,704,000

This $33.3 billion cut—to just under $95 billion—may be framed as a reorganization to tackle chronic disease and reduce healthcare costs, but beneath the rhetoric lies a troubling dismantling of the very infrastructure designed to advance public health, drive medical discovery, and protect our most vulnerable.
Nowhere is the proposed rollback more alarming than in the realm of scientific research. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), the engine of U.S. biomedical innovation from which we all benefit, would see its funding slashed by $18 billion—from $45 billion to $27.5 billion—and its structure gutted, consolidating into just eight institutes or centers. Such a move ignores decades of bipartisan support for the NIH and undermines the United States’ global leadership in medical research. These cuts will decelerate clinical trials, delay therapies, and disincentivize young scientists from entering the field. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network warns that the 37% cut to the National Cancer Institute would “stall scientific breakthroughs” and hamper efforts against the increasing incidence of cancer across America. Translation: lives will be lost waiting for discoveries that now may never happen.
The effects of these cuts will be especially devastating in states like North Carolina, a national leader in biomedical research, academic medicine, and public health innovation. Institutions such as Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Wake Forest, and East Carolina University receive hundreds of millions annually from NIH and HHS to fund research on everything from cancer to mental health to rural healthcare delivery. If these funding sources dry up or diminish, North Carolina’s research infrastructure—its labs, its jobs, and its ability to develop life-saving treatments—will likely suffer.
In 2022 alone, North Carolina institutions received over $1.8 billion in NIH funding. These dollars supported everything from HIV prevention programs in underserved areas to groundbreaking cancer immunotherapy research. The University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, which has led critical studies on pandemic response and maternal health, faces a direct threat under these budget proposals. And Duke’s renowned Clinical and Translational Science Institute, which works to turn research into real-world healthcare solutions, would likely struggle to maintain operations at current levels.
Beyond academic campuses, the proposed cuts threaten North Carolina’s community health centers, rural hospitals, and telehealth programs—many of which rely on HHS grants to reach underserved populations. The elimination of key funding for CDC public health initiatives and the Affordable Care Act’s Prevention and Public Health Fund will hit rural counties the hardest, where high rates of chronic illness and limited access to care demand more investment, not less.
The proposed budget does include some provocative titles—like the $500 million “Make America Healthy Again” initiative—but these piecemeal programs offer a fraction of the scale needed to address national health challenges. Only $119 million is allocated for a Prevention Innovation program, while over $1.5 billion in HIV prevention programs are being slashed. North Carolina, which continues to fight high rates of HIV, will feel the consequences firsthand.
Innovation is not just about profit or prestige—it’s about people. Patients waiting for a clinical trial in Charlotte, veterans accessing mental health support through telehealth in western North Carolina, and community health workers in rural eastern North Carolina trying to curb diabetes rates. These are the real faces behind the numbers.
Congress now holds the line. It must reject this dangerous budget, reinvest in science and health equity, and protect the institutions that allow America—and North Carolina—not just to respond to crises, but prevent them. Innovation cannot survive on slogans. It thrives on sustained, strategic, and science-driven investment. Anything less is not just shortsighted—it’s reckless.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nihjacket2025_0-1024x576.png,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Ever since North Carolina legislators established the so-called “Opportunity Scholarships” school voucher program, sponsors and proponents have pitched it as a means of helping low-income students escape struggling public schools.
Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, a new report from the Department of Public Instruction shows that this was all baloney. The DPI researchers found that just sixty-seven hundred of the state’s eighty-thousand-plus vouchers in the current school year went to students who had attended a North Carolina public school in the prior year.
And while the data for kindergartners were not yet available, it’s clear that as much as ninety percent or more of new vouchers in 24-25 were for students who have never attended a public school.
In other words, the vast majority of voucher money is going to parents – most of them well-off – who never had any intention of sending their kids to public schools.
The bottom line: School vouchers in our state have nothing to do with quote “opportunity” and everything to do with undermining and privatizing public education. Other explanations are simply false.

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department. In rural counties, the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, less prenatal care and higher rates of babies being born too early. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.



Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.



You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services.


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform



“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

Cindy Holscher appears at the Statehouse in Topeka as part of the 50501 national day of action on May 1, 2025. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Sen. Cindy Holscher says she will seek the Democratic nomination for governor to try to protect public schools and shield the state from a potential double dose of “slash and burn policies” ignited by Republicans at federal and state levels.
Holscher, from Overland Park, planned to announce her candidacy Thursday, becoming the first well-known Democrat to enter the race. A slate of Republicans have already announced their intentions to replace Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who is serving her second term.
Holscher said she is focusing on “kitchen table” issues after seeing fellow Democrats lose legislative seats in last year’s election.
“I understand the struggles people are facing — that housing is expensive, that food is expensive,” Holscher said. “Those tend to be the things that I focus on in terms of, you know, what’s going to help me, and what’s going to help my family, and what’s going to help other members of my community succeed. I mean, those are very real big issues in terms of being able to pay your bills, being able to afford rent, and afford the things that you need to get by. So that’s where I tend to focus most of my energy.”
Holscher served two terms in the Kansas House after winning her first race in 2016, then moved to the Senate in 2020, where she won a seat in a competitive district that was formerly held by the Republican majority leader. While other Democrats struggled, she improved her winning margin from 9 percentage points in 2020 to 23 percentage points in 2024.
The way Holscher tells it, she came from “humble beginnings” in — “this is the part people don’t like” — rural Missouri.
“I was born there — I had no input on it,” she joked, in a nod to the border state rivalry.
She said her grandparents were tenant farmers and that her parents took care of the farm while working other jobs. Her father, a veteran, was a construction worker, and her mother was a school janitor.
Holscher earned a degree in journalism with a political science emphasis from the University of Missouri, “but you don’t have to mention that,” she said.
She said she and her husband moved to the Kansas City, Kansas, metro area more than 25 years ago. They wanted to start a family and were impressed with the schools, she said. She worked in several positions at Sprint Corp., including in operations, where she designed multibillion-dollar budgets.
But her kids were in school when former Republican Gov. Sam Brownback’s administration cratered state finances to pay for his ill-fated “tax experiment” and engineered steep cuts to public education. Even in Johnson County, which is known for its economic prosperity, schools didn’t have enough supplies, Holscher said, and some of the classrooms had shower curtains instead of doors.
When her daughter was about 10, she said, they saw one of her teachers working at Target. The daughter asked why her teacher would be working there on the weekend when she already worked full-time at the school.
“I told her, ‘Well, we’re in the middle of a severe budget crisis. Schools aren’t getting funded the way they should, and she probably can’t pay her bills,’ ” Holscher said.
Her daughter looked at Holscher and said: “You go fix that.”
“As I thought about it, I’m like, OK, good, reasonable people are going to have to step forward to stop this spiraling downward,” Holscher said. “And that’s how I ended up running for office. I’ve kind of stayed in the fight because every year, that extremist base has gotten bigger, and they’re really trying to reach their goals of destroying public education and implementing some of those very backward tax and economic policies.”
She said she is running for governor in part because she has now invested 10 years fighting for public schools and economic stability.
Holscher supports reproductive health rights, Medicaid expansion and the legalization of medicinal marijuana. She said state tax policy “isn’t real fair to the regular Kansan” and needs to be corrected.
She has been a vocal critic of the Committee on Government Efficiency — or COGE, inspired by Elon Musk’s federal initiative known as DOGE — where she is the ranking minority member.
During recent town halls across the state, she said, people have expressed fear and anxiety about the impact of federal cuts and “the fact that we have a supermajority of same-style extremists in the Legislature.”
Lt. Gov. David Toland, who also serves as commerce secretary, is a potential challenger for the Democratic nomination for governor. But it isn’t clear whether Toland, or other Democrats, will run.
The Republican field is led by Secretary of State Scott Schwab. Other potential candidates include former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, state Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara, businesswoman Stacy Rogers and Wichita school board member Joy Eakins. 
Only conservative podcaster Doug Billings has paid the filing fee to be a candidate.
Holscher said party insiders suggested she could wait to run until 2030 because if a Republican were to win this time around and implement damaging policies, it would be easier for Democrats to win races later.
“The fact of the matter is if all of those damaging policies move forward, and many of them will, that just means that a number of people won’t be able to have a future here in Kansas,” Holscher said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5011393-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Kurtis Gregory warned about the potential hit to jobs and tax revenues if the state were to lose a team.
But on the floor of the Senate last week, he acknowledged that pride was also a prime motivator in his efforts to make hundreds of millions of dollars available to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Kansas City Royals, both of which are being courted to move several miles away into neighboring Kansas.
A former University of Missouri football player, Gregory pointed to the Missouri-Kansas rivalry that dates back to the Civil War and characterized Kansas as “kind of an archrival.”
“We just let the state of Kansas poach, you know, really the pride and joy of the western side of the state, and I would say the entire state of Missouri?” he said in his floor speech. “And then I would also say, what’s next? What’s the next thing the state of Kansas is going to try and take from us?”
Days after the 2025 legislative session ended in May, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called a special session for lawmakers to consider stadium funding and disaster relief bills. Last week, the state Senate approved Gregory’s stadium incentives bill in the middle of the night by a 19-13 vote. On Wednesday afternoon, the state House approved the measure by a 90-58 vote, sending it to the governor’s desk.
The bill would fund up to 50% of construction or renovation costs and is estimated to cost about $1.5 billion over 30 years, the Missouri Independent reported.
Stateline was unable to reach Gregory for comment.
Economists have panned the ongoing stadium bidding war between Missouri and Kansas — which has offered to pay up to 70% of new stadium costs — as a waste of taxpayer dollars. But Gregory’s comments highlight the emotional undercurrents frequently at play in sports stadium funding debates across the country.
Experts nearly unanimously agree that public subsidies for stadiums are a poor investment, but that hasn’t slowed a wave of local and state spending for billionaire team owners.
More taxpayer money benefits pro sports owners amid ‘stadium construction wave’

Washington, D.C., could spend more than $1 billion to move the Washington Commanders some seven miles from a suburb in Maryland to a new facility planned for the old RFK Stadium site, described by the team’s controlling owner as the “spiritual home” of the NFL franchise.
Geoffrey Propheter, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Denver who studies stadium deals, said these kinds of arguments ignore the economic reality of stadium subsidies.
“You’re not talking economics. You’re talking pure emotion,” he said.
Despite mounds of evidence showing the public does not fare well on stadium investments, he said lawmakers and mayors still tout the potential for jobs and new tax revenues with stadiums and arenas.
Oftentimes, teams and politicians stir fears about the possibility of losing franchises to another market to increase pressure, he said. But three of the most prominent stadium subsidy deals under consideration now — in Chicago, Kansas City and the district — involve teams looking to move within the same metro area.
“I would appreciate it if lawmakers were that transparent, and they’re like, ‘I don’t care how much this costs, there’s no price that’s too high for us to pay to keep them here,’” Propheter said.
‘Generations to get past’
But cities and states have more at stake than raw economics, said Irwin Kishner, a New York attorney who has represented pro teams in multiple stadium deals.
He likened the stadium debate to those surrounding the Olympics: Research has found that host cities generally spend well in excess of the revenue generated by the games. But cities and nations still fiercely compete for the chance to host the high-profile event.
“It elevates the status of venues,” Kishner said. “And I think it’s very much the same thing with stadiums and arenas.”
He said cities also face potential economic consequences of lost jobs and tax revenues if teams leave altogether.
Oakland, California, for example, lost both its pro football and baseball teams to Nevada after local stadium talks fell apart. The NFL’s Raiders now play in Las Vegas and MLB’s A’s are playing temporarily in West Sacramento, California, before moving into their under-construction stadium on the Vegas strip.
“What happened in Oakland is a classic example of what happens when a team doesn’t get their building in the way they want it,” Kishner said.
And those sorts of relocations can leave lasting marks, he said, pointing to the sour feelings that still persist in Brooklyn decades after MLB’s Dodgers left for Los Angeles. Other cities have similarly iconic teams, such as the NFL’s Chicago Bears.
“When push comes to shove, municipalities would be embarrassed to lose a team. I mean, could you imagine the Bears playing in St. Louis as an argument?” Kishner said. “I think Chicago would have something to say about that in a very emotional way. And by the way, these things take generations to get past.”
Currently, Chicago’s stadium discussions are more localized.
After first sharing plans to build a new stadium along Lake Michigan’s shore in Chicago, the Bears are now pursuing a massive football stadium development in suburban Arlington Heights. Despite introducing various tax measures aimed to benefit megaprojects such as stadiums, Illinois lawmakers ended their session on May 31 with no action on the matter.










My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal, but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.


– Illinois Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner


Democratic state Rep. Kam Buckner, whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side, said lawmakers have little appetite to invest heavily in stadiums.
The MLS’ Chicago Fire just announced plans to privately finance a new $650 million professional soccer stadium in the city’s South Loop — the same area the MLB’s White Sox are also eyeing as they explore a new baseball stadium.
“The days of widespread public money for private stadiums without public benefit — those days are over, and that is not just a sentiment in the state of Illinois. I think this is a sentiment across the country,” Buckner said.
Still, he acknowledged the sway emotions can have in the matter. While the Bears leaving the city limits likely would not affect the region’s economy, he said, it would still prove a blow to morale.
“My brain tells me it’s not that big of a deal,” he said, “but my heart and soul as a Chicagoan doesn’t want them to leave.”
Money matters
Missouri’s stadium debate has been simmering for years now: The Royals first announced plans in 2022 to move downtown from their stadium on the outskirts of the city. And the Chiefs — who share the sprawling stadium complex with the Royals — quickly followed with talks of wanting a new or renovated stadium.
After voters in a county election last year soundly rejected extending a stadium sales tax to fund those plans, lawmakers across the border in Kansas passed legislation that would fund up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums. That measure expires at the end of June, pushing Missouri legislators to act.
Neil deMause, a journalist who has written extensively about stadium subsidies, said such deadlines are arbitrary and meant to exact political pressure.
While politicians once had plausible deniability about the pitfalls of stadium subsidies, the research is now overwhelmingly clear and well covered in the media, he said. (It’s been nearly a decade since HBO’s John Oliver dedicated an episode of his satirical news show to the folly of stadium finance.)
Kansas v. Missouri stadium battle shows how states are reigniting border wars

But politicians on both sides of the aisle continue to push stadium subsidies — whether they’re touting the potential for wider real estate development or intangibles such as team pride and fears of losing franchises.
“It’s this prescribed dance, where everybody sort of pretends to be doing due diligence, but at the same time, everybody knows it’s going to happen,” deMause said.
He said that appears to be the case in the nation’s capital.
In April, city and team officials for the Washington Commanders announced plans for a 65,000-seat stadium. The proposed deal, which must be approved by the full city council, would cost taxpayers some $1.1 billion over eight years.
But deMause’s analysis of the plan determined the public will be spending well in excess of that figure because of billions in free rent and hundreds of millions in property tax breaks. He estimates taxpayers will pay or forgo at least $7.5 billion on the deal.
“Everybody in and around the D.C. Council seems to be saying, ‘Yeah, it sure is a lot of money, but the mayor really wants it, so it’s going to happen. It’s just a matter of whether or not we can improve it some,’” he said. “It’s a little bit like saying, ‘World War II is going to happen — just try and keep the death toll down.’”
Last week, Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser’s office released a report it commissioned that projected the stadium would create billions in new economic output and local tax revenue in the coming decades — figures that were quickly disputed by skeptical economists and academics.
Still, much of the district’s stadium conversation has centered on intangibles such as hometown pride and nostalgia. Even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell waxed about his childhood memories attending games at the old RFK Stadium at an April event announcing the deal.
Sitting in front of a “WELCOME HOME” banner at that event, the mayor said the RFK site was “where they belong.”
“I want to start by saying welcome home,” she said.

(Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)This story was updated on June 12 at 10:10 a.m. to correct the bill number of an earlier open enrollment bill, House Bill 741.
In 2009, New Hampshire lawmakers passed a law intended to be transformational. The new law allowed public school boards to vote to accept students from any school district in the state.
Prospect Mountain High School in Alton chose to adopt that policy of “open enrollment.” To the school’s superintendent, Timothy Broadrick, it was a survival move in an era of declining enrollment. 
“I can tell you from our direct experience that if you wish to have a functional public school choice system in the state of New Hampshire, this is necessary,” he said at a Senate hearing in April. 
But nearly two decades later, Prospect Mountain is the only school in the state to choose the open enrollment option. 
This year, House Republicans are pushing to make open enrollment mandatory across the state, advocating for a law that would require all school districts to accept students from outside their district if they have capacity.
Though the idea has seen resistance in the Senate this year, the House doubled down last week. The chamber added a last-minute amendment to an unrelated piece of legislation, Senate Bill 210, sending the universal open enrollment idea to the Senate one more time.
The Senate has voted multiple times this year to hold similar proposals for further study. And representatives of public schools are urging lawmakers to put the brakes on the idea, arguing it could create chaos for school districts.
But on Thursday, senators will vote on whether to accept the House’s proposal and send it to Gov. Kelly Ayotte, reject it entirely, or request further negotiations with the House through a committee of conference.
The amendment in SB 210 would require that public school districts post monthly reports to their websites listing the number of vacancies in each school. It would allow parents to apply to send their children to school districts, without paying application fees. And it would require the receiving district to accept the student as long as there is space, with exceptions possible if the student was expelled from the previous district or has a documented history of disciplinary issues or chronic absenteeism. 
The bill would require the district in which the student lives to pay the receiving district at least 80% of the per-pupil annual cost at the receiving district; under the bill, the Department of Education would set the exact amount. 
To House Republicans, the bill would be another step forward for the school choice movement, whose supporters believe parents should have more options for their kids’ education than the public school district in the town where they live.
Rep. Glenn Cordelli, who authored a similar bill earlier this year, argues open enrollment policies would create more opportunity. 
“We hear that public schools are open to all students, but that’s not true,” he said at a hearing in April. “We practice ZIP code discrimination when it comes to public schools that children can attend.”
Cordelli contends that making the policy mandatory would force public school districts to compete for students, knowing they could lose them to other districts. That, he says, could inspire schools to try new teaching approaches to attract students. 
Broadrick agrees with that idea.
“My school boards, along with our high school faculty and myself, welcome an opportunity to compete with charter schools, with private schools and with other public schools, to show families that we are worthy of their choice,” he said. 
But others are warning the Senate not to vote to make open enrollment mandatory, arguing it would be unfair for both wealthy and under-resourced districts. 
“You’re basically forcing one school district to subsidize a different school district,” said Barrett Christina, executive director of the New Hampshire School Boards Association, in testimony to the Senate in April. “The voters in one town are going to be subsidizing the school district in another town.”
Brian Winslow, chairman of the Northwood School Board, said if universal open enrollment passed, it would be difficult for school boards to set budgets, not knowing if they will be receiving students or losing them.
“This just would represent an unfunded additional charge to Northwood students that may balance out (or that) may not balance out,” he said. 
Observers believed the House’s proposal had stalled this year after the Senate voted to retain House Bill 741 and removed similar language from the House-passed budget. But with the potential re-emergence of the issue — both in SB 210 and in the coming negotiations between the House and Senate over the budget policy bill, House Bill 2 — the New Hampshire School Administrators Association is urging restraint.
In a press release Tuesday, the association issued a bulleted list of issues it has with implementation of SB 210, including how special education funding would be coordinated between districts receiving students, how the new law would affect existing tuition agreements between school districts, and how school districts could budget for increases or decreases in students throughout the year.
“A district that sees a sudden increase of students during the school year will face two choices: Cut existing services to stay within approved spending, or call a special meeting to raise taxes. Similarly, a district that sees a sudden decline in enrollment will face a decrease in revenue and simultaneous increase in expenses,” the association said in a statement.
The Senate has expressed skepticism about the bill, and in particular about implementing it in time for the 2025-2026 school year. When an earlier version of the bill, House Bill 741, was heard before the Senate in April, nine people registered support and 752 people registered as opposed, according to a Senate hearing report. The Senate later voted to re-refer the bill to the Senate Education Committee, allowing the committee to work on the bill until January, when it must make a decision.
Cordelli argues the bill would address advocates’ longstanding concerns about keeping public dollars in public schools. But he argues that providing choice is important. 
“The status quo was not working in many places,” he said. “The education freedom that we have been talking about is not available only for private schools or home schooling. It should be available for public schools as well, so that the child can have the education opportunity that best meets their individual needs.” 
Prospect Mountain’s open enrollment status has sparked a legal dispute with the Pittsfield School District, after Prospect Mountain accepted four Pittsfield students and asked the Pittsfield School District to pay tuition. The Pittsfield School District has argued it did not authorize the students to go to Prospect Mountain and should not have to pay the tuition; the New Hampshire State Board of Education ruled in May 2024 that they must. 
Pittsfield School District filed an appeal of the State Board’s ruling to the state Supreme Court in August 2024; in November, the court indicated it would take up the appeal. The court has not yet scheduled oral arguments, but could decide to waive oral arguments and issue a written decision from the briefs. It has not yet issued a decision.
In the meantime, lawmakers did pass a separate bill this year, House Bill 771, that clarifies that school districts must pay tuition to open enrollment school districts under the current law. That bill is awaiting House approval of changes made by the Senate.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yrbslegislation-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Wes Moore (left) heads to the state's sale of $1.6 billion in bonds Wednesday. Officials said the state ""did very well"" on the sale, after weeks of concern about a slight credit downgrade. (Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)Maryland “did very well” in the sale Wednesday of about $1.6 billion in bonds, state officials said, despite a recent credit downgrade that rattled their confidence and raised fears of higher costs.
The Maryland Board of Public works on Wednesday voted to approve the sale of about $1.6 billion worth of bonds at a true interest cost of 3.55% and premiums of more than $125 million, according to a statement from the Maryland Treasurer’s Office.
It’s impossible to compare one year to another because of shifting markets and the many factors that go into a sale, said Treasurer Dereck Davis after the board meeting. But last year, by comparison, the state sold about $1 billion of tax-exempt bonds with about $151 million in premiums, his office said.
The bond sale was the first since ratings agency Moody’s downgraded Maryland’s creditworthiness in May from AAA to Aa-1, the second-highest rating. The other ratings agencies, Fitch and Standard & Poor’s, reaffirmed their AAA ratings for Maryland. But it was the first time in decades that the state went into a bond sale without AAA ratings from all three agencies.
The downgrade could have meant less interest from banks or higher interest on the bonds. But Davis said the bond sale went as expected, and that the state’s bonds are “as desirable as they’ve always been.” Each group of bonds sold Wednesday received six bids, he said.
During the meeting, the board sold packages of general obligation bonds to four New York firms: $485.2 million to Jefferies LLC; $414.8 million to the Bank of America’s BofA Securities, $362 million to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC; and $294.7 million to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.

In the statement, Davis said the sale represents “the strong demand for Maryland’s bonds and continued investor confidence in the fiscal strength and creditworthiness of our state.”
Baltimore economist Anirban Basu said the market had a “strong reception” to the bonds, given the significant uncertainty regarding U.S. stocks and equities, and because the state was still rated AAA by two other agencies.
“So the penalty for Maryland’s credit rating downgrade is extremely small at this time,” said Basu, president of the Sage Policy Group. But the state’s economy is still heading in the wrong direction, he said, as the state’s budget continues to grow without the tax base increasing accordingly.
Moody’s attributed its downgrade to the state’s economic underperformance compared to other AAA-rated states. The agency expects the underperformance will continue given Maryland’s high fixed costs and “heightened vulnerability to shifting federal policies and employment,” it said in a statement announcing the decision in May.
Maryland had almost 270,000 residents employed by the federal government in 2023, making the state particularly vulnerable to federal cuts by the Trump administration. Basu said that for years the state’s economic focus has been “eds, meds and feds”: educational services, medical research and delivery, and federal employment and contracting.
“We’re institutional,” he said. “And therefore, because we are institutional, we are stable.”
But now that education, medicine and federal employment are under pressure, the state needs to attract significantly more private investment — something Maryland is struggling to do with its high tax rate, Basu said.
But Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said the state is “seeing the uncertainty created by the Trump administration really create chaos.”
“Maryland is feeling the repercussions of that,” Ferguson said Wednesday.
The state maintaining its stable AAA from its other two agencies prevented it from seeing a “hugely negative impact,” Ferguson said. He added the state is “as stable as can be given our reliance on the federal government.”
Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, who is a member of the board but was not present at Wednesday’s meeting, declined through her office to comment on the bond sale.
At the conclusion of the bond sale, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that “the state did very well.”
“There’s no reason for us to be Moody today,” he said.

Wes Moore share a laugh during Wednesday's Board of Public Works meeting. (Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)Hampstead officials have been monitoring unsafe levels of PFAS in the town’s well water for several years now, but soon hope to begin construction on a long-sought solution.
The Board of Public Works on Wednesday approved a $19.5 million appropriation for Hampstead, which is embarked on a $31 million project to build granular activated carbon filters around town that will remove the contaminant from the drinking water. The project also includes pipelines to deliver the water for treatment and the possibility of upgrading one filtering site to nitrate treatment in the future.
Hampstead Mayor Christopher Nevins, who attended Wednesday’s board meeting to support the appropriation, said engineering for the project is done and it’s time to start construction.
“It’s been in engineering now for well over a year, and the plan has always been to work with MDE,” he said, referring to the  Maryland Department of the Environment, which presented the request.
Otherwise known as “forever chemicals,” per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were detected in a Hampstead drinking well in 2021. The human-made chemical compounds are used in consumer products as well as other areas, according to a statement from the Department of the Environment.

MDE began monitoring for PFAS in 202o, and in 2022 it recorded levels of two different types of forever chemicals, according to the town’s 2022 Annual Water Report, which said it found PFOA at concentrations of 1.41 to 8.08 parts per trillion, and PFOS at levels under 1 ppt up to 5 ppt.
In 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency announced maximum contaminant levels of 4.0 ppt for both PFOA and PFOS.
The project is nearly done with the engineering phase, Nevin said. The next step is constructing the water lines and revised new pump houses with granular activated carbon,, he said.
The board on Wednesday also approved millions of dollars in funding with little debate for an online data platform, nine public library projects, an arts and culture venue in Columbia and green development throughout the state, among other projects. Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) was not able to attend Wednesday’s meeting but the board’s other two members, Gov. Wes Moore (D) and state Treasurer Dereck Davis (D), were present.
MD THINK
The board approved $124.31 million in funding to transfer an online data platform from the Department of Human Services to the Department of Information Technology. 
The Maryland Total Human-services Integrated Network, or MD THINK, lets state agencies share technical services and data online to provide a one-stop shop for child welfare and support information, according to its website. Currently  operated by the DHS, the MD THINK Committee voted in September to make DoIT the platform operator instead of the DHS.
DoIT officials did not respond to requests Wednesday for comment on the shift.
Public libraries
Grants totaling $7.2 million will go to the Maryland State Library Agency to improve nine library projects throughout the state.
“Our public libraries play an incredibly important role in our communities, because they really are more than just homes for books,” Moore said. “They serve as community centers. They serve as places where people get internet access. They really do represent all the different places and spaces that people in Maryland really enjoy.” 
The allotments include a contribution of $249,000 toward construction of a Park Heights library in Baltimore, which has already received $5 million from the state, according to the meeting agenda. Other funding includes $1.55 million for a Cecil County library in Elkton and $1.1 million toward the Friendsville Library in Garrett County.
Merriweather Post Pavilion
The board also approved $4 million for improvements to Merriweather Post Pavilion in downtown Columbia, part of a total $57.5 million project. In the past decade, the Columbia Arts and Culture Commission has worked to revitalize the venue, Moore said. 
“It’s becoming true economic gain for Howard County,” Moore said. “We’re so proud to keep on supporting success. I know that I have personally enjoyed going out there.” 
Greenspace Equity Program
The Department of Natural Resources will receive $4 million for its Greenspace Equity Program, which implements development of open space projects in underserved communities. According to its website, the program aims to preserve public greenspace to increase livability in these areas.
“Since 2023, Department of Natural Resources has protected over 20,000 acres — just an absolutely outstanding number,” Moore said. “It is truly legacy work.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BPW-4845-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

These measures have garnered strong opinions on both sides of the issue.
Opponents, going back to James Madison, say constitutional conventions are risky because of their lack of regulation once a convention is called. This could allow for uncontrolled power-grabs that could result in amendments that may not be popular with the general public.
The U.S. Constitution can be amended in two ways: through Congress with amendments passed with two-thirds support of each chamber and then sent to the states for ratification; or through a constitutional convention invoked by Article V.
Article V is silent about rules and regulations once a convention is called.
In order to call a convention, two-thirds of states, or 34 of the 50, would have to pass their own resolutions applying for a constitutional convention for a certain purpose.
Past applications by states have aimed to force the federal government to balance their budget, but no such convention has happened in the history of the United States.
Recently, however, the draft of a lawsuit has been circulating to attorneys generals in some states, looking to make the convention happen based on a legal argument that applications from states — no matter the purpose or age of the request — can be combined and counted toward the 34 needed to bring about a constitutional convention, according to critics of the move.
“This is literally a rewrite of our Constitution,” said Viki Harrison, policy director for civil rights and civil liberties with Common Cause, a nonpartisan voting rights advocacy and government watchdog group with branches all over the country. “There would be nothing safe, there would be no guardrails.”
 Eyes on Ohio
Ohio has seen out-of-state interest in their measures, in what Common Cause Ohio’s Catherine Turcer called a “full-court press” this year of legislation and movement to see passage.
Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum appeared in March to support Senate Joint Resolution 3 in the Ohio Senate General Government Committee, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came to Ohio to support House Joint Resolution 3.
“It is very clear that Ohio is a focus of moving an Article V convention, that it is in fact a priority, and we are a state to watch,” Turcer said in a media briefing with other Common Cause branches.
Santorum spoke on behalf of Convention of States Action, an advocacy group pushing for support of a constitutional convention, arguing that America’s founders included the option of a constitutional convention “to give the states a way to counteract the federal government if it became abusive with its powers.”
Convention of States Action said 19 states have passed resolutions for a constitutional convention, and “we hope to see Ohio become state number 20,” according to state media liaison Diana Telles.
DeSantis argued that without term limits in Congress, “incentives to do really good policy are just skewed away,” making a constitutional amendment necessary.
The resolution DeSantis came to support, HJR 3, specifically applies for a convention of the states to institute congressional term limits.
The measure and its Senate counterpart, SJR 6, look to piggyback on a 1992 amendment to the Ohio Constitution that instituted term limits for Ohio’s members in Congress of two successive six-year terms in the U.S. Senate and four two-year terms in the U.S. House.
Those term limits aren’t being enforced because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 1996 that “the states have no authority to change the qualifications for members of Congress,” according to an analysis of HJR 3 done by the Legislative Service Commission.

While the resolutions spell out the necessary number of states needed to call a convention, they also point out that the Constitution “does not specify how a convention to propose amendments to the U.S. Constitution must be conducted or how its delegates are to be chosen.”
“Further, the Constitution does not indicate whether the states that apply for a convention may limit the scope of amendments the convention is to propose,” the HJR 3 and SJR 6 resolution analyses state.
While term limits are attractive to many Americans, the opposition to constitutional conventions has less to do with the specific issues and more to do with the freedom convention attendees would have if it takes place.
“Whether you like term limits or not, (the problem is) the mechanism to get it,” Harrison said.
As for the other convention request currently working its way through the Ohio legislature, HJR 2 and its companion, SJR 3, also want to see a convention that touches on term limits, but go further, looking at amendments “that impose fiscal restraints on the federal government” and “limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government.”
These measures go into more detail about the purported method through which conventions are formed, while also noting Congress “does not have power beyond calling the convention and setting a reasonable time and place.”
The Ohio bills name the state legislatures as authority-bearers when it comes to naming delegates to the convention, instructing delegates, and recalling delegates for “breach of a duty or a violation of the instructions provided.”
All four resolutions have seen hearings in their committees, but no votes have been cast on the measures yet, possibly because the legislature has had the main priority of passing a state operating budget by the end of June.
 National moves
Some states have been working to repeal resolutions that requested a convention, which, according to Georgetown University law professor David Super, could be the reason a lawsuit to combine existing resolutions is being floated.
“Congress decided long ago that it can only count applications together when they’re for the same purpose,” Super said, in the media briefing with Common Cause.
The Ohio resolutions on term limits specify that the application “is valid only for the purpose of a convention that is limited to considering congressional term limits,” and say it “should be aggregated with other state applications for a convention on term limits, but not with any applications on any other subject.”
The resolutions focused on federal fiscal responsibility say the measures are only valid if combined “with other applications from state legislatures that call for a convention for substantially the same purpose.”
Telles said the movement for a constitutional convention would be for all of these issues. From the Convention of States Action point of view, “it is necessary to address all of these areas, not just term limits or a balanced budget.”
“State amending conventions to propose amendments are a safe, civil and constitutional way for the states to flex their muscle and affect real change in Washington, D.C.,” Telles said. “It’s clear Washington is not going to fix itself.”
Even if the lawsuit is filed – it’s still just a draft at this point – Super said previous cases like it have fallen apart in the past, and “there are some really serious problems with it.”
“The reason that these cases have failed is … they operate on the premise that the federal courts can tell the legislature what to do,” Super said.
And while this issue has seen some momentum, according to Common Cause, the idea of implementing a constitutional convention isn’t a universally supported issue by any means, even among the same political parties.
“This is not a standard red-blue issue, there are members of Congress who have strongly supported a constitutional convention,” Super said. “But there are also members of Congress who are opposed to a convention.”

(Getty Images)Predictably, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement riots in Los Angeles have been viewed through a partisan lens. 
The left has suggested that the federalizing of the California National Guard is a mere dress rehearsal for a full military dictatorship by President Donald Trump, while the right has pounded the drum of pseudo-law and order with “[i]f they spit, we will hit.”
Both of these viewpoints are irresponsible, ill-conceived, and lean into misinformation.
Trump is within his lawful and precedential authority to federalize the National Guard given the current circumstances seen in and around Los Angeles. Spitting on a law enforcement officer is assault. However, Trump’s remark about spitting directly leading to hitting overtly encourages disproportionate use of force. Couple this with the speaker of the House saying that the governor of California “should be tarred and feathered.” 
Lost among the politics of this moment is something media analysts have been concerned about for quite some time — moments of social upheaval ceding fertile ground to the rapid spread and uptake of misinformation via artificial intelligence.
AI-generated images and chatbot responses about the Los Angeles situation have further exposed the startling lack of information and AI literacy among the American public. It is one thing for adults to engage with potential AI-driven misinformation, but consider that the minds of Generations Z and Alpha are developing within this information environment. 
The pertinent question to be asked is this: How will this caustic environment shape their information consumption habits?
The information environment surrounding Los Angeles right now is not an outlier. It once again reveals the scale of misinformation AI is capable of generating and the ease with which it can inflame public discourse. Yet, amid this crisis, Congress is pushing forward with what has been dubbed the big beautiful bill — a federal budget package that includes a 10-year moratorium on any state-level AI regulation. 
This regulation would prevent schools from teaching the vital skill of AI-driven information literacy.
 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation

Squirreled away in the 1,000-plus pages of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a clause which reads:
“…no state or political subdivision may enforce, during the 10-year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any law or regulation limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce.”
This clause explicitly forbids states and their political subdivisions (i.e. school boards) from enacting or enforcing any law or policy that “limits, restricts, or otherwise regulates” artificial intelligence systems. 
This broad language would ban everything from AI plagiarism checkers to basic AI literacy curricula in public education. While proponents claim this is about ensuring regulatory uniformity, the effect is much more pervasive. It locks state governments and schools into inaction in a time of dynamic technological change.
When teaching students to assess the authenticity of information, there is a hard line to walk between healthy skepticism and corrosive cynicism. AI makes this line ever more opaque to navigate. 
Developing minds are already traversing AI-saturated landscapes without the tools they need. Teaching AI literacy in schools is not a partisan demand; it is a civic necessity. Teachers should not demand students to be zealots or Luddites in regard to any topic. But teachers should encourage them to become friendly critics of digital information and AI — capable of examining the tools they use with both curiosity and caution.
To its supporters, the 10-year moratorium is being championed as a win for unfettered innovation. In a purely capitalistic sense, this is true and could lead to widespread economic prosperity. However, it is worth recalling that similar rhetoric surrounded the onset of social media platforms. 
We now know what happened when those technologies were left unregulated and used as substitutes for the in-person socialization of developing minds. Mental health spiraled, polarization deepened, and a generation came of age in an isolating echo chamber. We cannot afford to wait and see what AI will do on a larger, accelerated scale.
As the R Street Institute argues, the moratorium is a way to avoid a patchwork of conflicting state laws. What it actually does is prevent local communities from crafting age-appropriate, culturally relevant responses to a fast-moving technological frontier. This is not about red states or blue states, right or left. If Democrats controlled the Legislature, the tech lobby would have courted them the same way. 
This is about whether any policymaker who claims to care about children or families will acknowledge the responsibility of schools to prepare their students for the rapidly changing world beyond their walls.
 The next step for school curriculum

The next chapter of American life will be molded by the technologies developing minds use. This is precisely why a 21st-century, technology-focused curriculum needs to be at the forefront of every school board discussion this summer. 
Students should learn not only how to prompt AI responsibly, but how to verify the accuracy of its output. They should study its biases, understand its limitations, and consider its societal impacts. In doing so, they will be less likely to fall for the kinds of digital falsehoods intended to exacerbate moments of social upheaval. 
AI and information literacy are not passing educational trends like social-emotional learning or whole language instruction. They are part of a new baseline for civic competence. School districts should be empowered, not prohibited, from integrating these skills into their curricula. 
The technology shaping this generation will evolve faster than the ability to legislate solutions to its shortcomings. Education is the answer to prepare young minds for a world awash in AI and digital information.
Let us hope this answer does not get taken away from states and local school boards, leading students down the road to a big, beautiful AI disaster.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/aifuture-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

They just disagree on how to pay for it. Gov. Mike DeWine proposed increasing the taxes on gambling and Ohio House lawmakers favored issuing state bonds.
State senators thought way outside the box.
Every state oversees unclaimed funds — think old security deposits, uncashed checks, or even bank accounts. The state acts as a custodian for that money, holding it until the rightful owner comes forward to claim it.
According to the Ohio Department of Commerce, state officials are sitting on $4.8 billion in unclaimed funds.
State senators are now eyeing that money for stadium funding.
The Ohio Senate funding plan

The Ohio Senate’s budget, approved Wednesday, would redefine all unclaimed funds that passed into state custody prior to 2016 as “abandoned.” That money would then “escheat” — a legal term for transferring ownership — to the state.
“What this does is it takes idle money and puts it to work to create jobs, to create incremental taxes, and that’s why we’re so excited about this project,” Senate budget chief Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said at a press conference introducing the idea earlier this month.
Ohio officials would use a newly created fund, estimated at $1.7 billion, to put up the $600 million the Browns need while maintaining a nest egg for future sports and cultural facilities.
The Browns would pay its share back through tax revenue generated by the project. The team would also put up $100 million in case that tax revenue falls short.
Going forward, any unclaimed funds would move to the new stadium fund if no one claimed them within 10 years. Cirino emphasized companies often spend several years attempting to return funds before money ever gets transferred to the state’s custody.
Ohio Senate President Rob McColley added, “If you look at the $600 million amount, I believe all of those are at least 18 years or older. So, they’ve been sitting in the fund for some time.”
The alternatives, Cirino agued, aren’t particularly attractive. Raising taxes, even on gambling, is a nonstarter in his caucus. And borrowing money, even if the team pays back every penny, would carry substantial costs.
Over 25 years, those bonds would carry $400 million in debt servicing, Cirino said, “and the debt service would be paid out of the general fund.”
The plan’s supporters are quick to emphasize the safeguards. Anyone whose property gets rolled over in that first sweep to the stadium fund will have a ten-year grace period — extending to January 1, 2036 — in which they can still claim their money.
The Senate budget also appropriates an additional $1 million annually to support more outreach to the owners of unclaimed funds.
“Any property that belongs to anybody, rightfully and legitimately, we want them to get what they have coming to them,” Cirino said in an interview. “And we’re not suggesting anything to the contrary. We’re just simply setting a time period here, that is, we think, reasonable.”
Can they do that?
In Ohio, the state Department of Commerce oversees unclaimed funds, but in many other states that’s the state treasurer’s job. And the National Association of State Treasurers is unequivocal about how unclaimed property programs should run.
“We actually have official policy stating that we believe that state unclaimed property programs should make these funds available to their owners in perpetuity,” NAST Executive Director Shaun Snyder explained.
The group’s policy statement raises concerns about potential legal challenges and emphasizes a state taking custody of unclaimed property isn’t the same as taking ownership of it. At their heart, Snyder argued, unclaimed funds programs are built on trust.
“You get that trust by telling people, ‘Look, if you lose your property, you will be able to claim it. We will keep it for you and protect it for you,’” he explained. “When states decide to essentially add in a cut-off of some kind, that can undermine that process.”
Snyder noted there are just four states with policies that escheat unclaimed funds to the state after a specific period of time.
Two of them, Arizona and Indiana, wait much longer than Ohio proposes, only transferring funds to the state after 25 years. Hawaii and Rhode Island set the cut off at 10 years, but only for small amounts — less than $100 in Hawaii and less than $50 in Rhode Island.
Like Snyder, the Urban Institute’s Lucy Dadayan argued that “redirecting these funds for public projects, even after a long dormancy period, risks undermining public trust and confidence in government.”
She also raised doubts about the sustainability of the idea. If the stadium funding plan raises awareness, more people could come forward with claims and reduce the amount of money flowing to the stadium fund.
“Well, it’s definitely outside-the-box,” University of Chicago Professor Justin Marlowe said of the proposal.
Marlowe heads up the school’s Center for Municipal Finance and explained he hasn’t heard of any other state using unclaimed quite like Ohio is considering.
One of the virtues of that approach, he said, is it provides the necessary upfront costs without raising taxes or borrowing a lot of money.
“I suppose that’s a tradeoff that’s worth making if you’re willing to get over the conceptual leap of using unclaimed property to this effect,” he said. “I get what they’re trying to solve for, and this is definitely a creative way to solve for that, for better or for worse.”
But Marlowe raised some notable concerns. His center runs a podcast, he said, and they’ve spoken with about 15 state treasurers. All of them have a story about reconnecting people with long-lost property.
“That’s not a 10-year arc, that’s a several decades long arc,” he said. “And so, it does kind of raise that question of, is 10 years the right timeframe? Because no one’s ever really done this, I don’t think there’s any right or wrong answer. That’s kind of a policy choice, but it does seem short.”
Marlowe added the systematic transfer of citizens’ property raises legal complications that aren’t easy to answer.
The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibits the government from taking private property without “just compensation.”
Ohio’s Constitution carries similar requirements and puts the onus on the state to show that taking was necessary and for public use.
Additionally, the escheatment program could raise due process questions.
“I’m sure they can write the law in a way to insulate them from a lot of that, but at some level, these are not statutory questions. These are much broader, constitutional — almost philosophical — questions,” he said. “Which might be why no one has done this to date, right?”
Reactions closer to home
In testimony submitted to the Ohio Senate Finance Committee, the City of Cleveland set aside questions about the source of the money and argued that the new Browns stadium would harm their lakefront redevelopment efforts.
“Public funds — whether from the General Revenue Fund or the unclaimed property fund — should be used to strengthen cities, not undermine them,” the city argued.
Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne wasn’t bashful about criticizing the unclaimed property idea though.
“This is not robbing Peter to pay Paul,” he argued. “This is robbing Bob and Betty Buckeye to pay (Browns owners) Jimmy and Dee Haslam.”
Cirino bristled at that characterization.
“That’s a load of garbage, okay? We’re not stealing any money from anybody,” he insisted. “I found his comments about the Senate quite insulting as a matter of fact.”
He noted lawmakers have dipped into unclaimed funds “at least a dozen times previously.”
A Legislative Service Commission memo shared with Ohio Capital Journal notes lawmakers have authorized $1.2 billion in cash transfers out of the fund and used it to capitalize the state’s mortgage insurance and housing development funds. However, that money is subject to recall if it’s needed to pay the rightful owners of unclaimed funds.
The proposal got support from the Ohio Business Roundtable. In a letter to the Senate Finance Committee, the group’s President and CEO Pat Tiberi argued it’s a “strategic and fiscally responsible approach” to funding venues.
“A statewide fund ensures Ohio is positioned to proactively support these capital-intensive projects as a means of regional growth and long-term economic competitiveness — not just for a single city or franchise, but for the benefit of all regions,” Tiberi wrote.
“Importantly,” he added, “the Senate’s proposal avoids placing new tax burdens on Ohioans, taking general revenue funds or increasing the state’s debt obligations.”
Like Cirino, Tiberi emphasized the plan would put “idle” resources to more productive use.

All four statewide executive offices of governor, attorney general, auditor, and secretary of state are up for open election in 2026, with all of the current Republican incumbents term-limited out of running for the same positions again.
Former Ohio Health Department Director Dr. Amy Acton is currently the only Democratic candidate running for Ohio governor. Republican candidates include businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill.
Democrats are waiting to see if former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown will run for Senate or Ohio governor, or nothing at all.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026.
Current Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost had been running for governor, but recently dropped out of the race after the Ohio Republican Party endorsed Ramaswamy.
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. No other Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor, treasurer, or attorney general.
The last time any Democratic candidates won any of Ohio’s statewide executive offices was in 2006, when Ted Strickland was elected governor, Marc Dann was elected attorney general, Rich Cordray was elected treasurer, and Jennifer Brunner was elected secretary of state. They were all swept out of office in the 2010 cycle.
The vote for a new Ohio House Minority Leader is expected to happen the last week of June, right before the lawmakers go on summer break, Russo said. 
“I’m not making any endorsements,” she said. “The decision about who will leave this caucus next is up to the entire caucus, not one individual member.” 
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said he has no idea who is going to replace Russo.
“I said to members of our caucus, obviously, they’re free to vote however they want, but we’re just going to wait to see what comes out of the minority caucus and deal with that,” he said. 
Russo is term-limited and her term ends on Dec. 31, 2026. 
“I’m looking forward to shifting my focus to policy work and being back on committees,” she said. “I’m excited about the potential of the new leadership team and the energy that brings and to work alongside those folks.”

(Photo by Sam Gauntt/Maryland Matters)Woodlawn High School Principal Jamel Jernigan said that in addition to the usual stresses of high school life, students in her Baltimore County school face mental health needs that impact their learning.
That’s why renewed funding for a state consortium that helps boost connections between schools and mental health resources is so welcome, she said during an event outside the State House Wednesday.
“We serve a vibrant, resilient and diverse student community,” Jernigan said at the event on Lawyers’ Mall. “But like so many schools across the state, we’ve seen firsthand how mental health crises continue to impact our students.”
The Maryland Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports will award a total of $96 million in grants this year to 107 programs to help combat increasing anxiety, depression and other challenges students are facing today. The consortium grew out of the state’s education reform plan, the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, to improve student mental and behavioral health by providing greater access to wraparound services.
The $96 million in grants funding will help support programs and organizations to provide more targeted services attuned to the needs of students in each county, reaching 80% of Maryland schools, officials say. The grant awards vary by program, ranging from $71,000 to just over $3.5 million.

For Woodlawn High School, the consortium helped expand access to school-based mental health providers, connected families with community services and created spaces where “students can feel seen, heard, supported and empowered,” Jernigan said.
“That has made all the difference – from increasing graduation rates, attendance and engagement to boosting healthier relationships and improved outcomes, both inside and outside the classroom,” she said Wednesday.
“We must recognize that today, our youth are facing unprecedented challenges,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), on hand with other state leaders at the event to announce the second round of grants for the program.
“We want them to be successful. But what we know is … if their mental health is not strong, nothing else matters,” Ferguson said. “They cannot be successful if they don’t believe in themselves to recognize their own God-given potential.”
House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) added that while students have long struggled with mental health, the COVID-19 pandemic brought those issues to the forefront, along with political unrest and social media.
“We continue to be particularly concerned about the alarming increase in anxiety, depression, self-harm and other kinds of mental illness impacting our students,” Jones said.
Mary Gable, assistant state superintendent in the Maryland State Department of Education’s Division of Student Support and Federal Programs, said the 107 programs funded with the grants cover a wide range of topics, including “screenings, counseling, addiction treatment, family support, crisis planning and services, telehealth services, support groups and wraparound services.”
The consortium was almost a victim of steep budget cuts as the General Assembly worked this year to balance a state budget with a $3 billion deficit.
Funded at $130 million in Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) budget, the consortium funding was cut to $40 million by the House. The Senate held out for $70 million this year and $100 million a year thereafter, which was approved in the final budget.
During budget talks this year, advocates and consortium partners warned that pulling funding for the consortium would greatly diminish the reach of the mental health network.
David Rudolph, chair of the consortium and a former delegate from Cecil County, expects that the General Assembly will continue to fund the consortium as much as possible in upcoming years.
“The commitment is there,” he said.

Senior year of high school is all about decisions, ones that 17-year-old Michelle Huang is getting ready to make.
“Everyone around me is working on applying; everyone’s thinking about college,” Huang said. “It’s on the top of our minds right now.”
And like a lot of students, where she goes could be chosen in part by how much financial aid she gets — which Ohio Statehouse leaders are trying to address.
“We wanted to keep our best and brightest in Ohio,” Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, said.
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was passed in the Ohio House budget. Already existing, this language would extend the proposal that gives the top 5% of each graduating high school class $5,000 a year to attend a public or private school in Ohio.
But the Ohio Senate made some changes in their proposal, reducing the scholarship to the top 2% of students. McColley explains that now — that money has strings attached.
“If we want to keep them in Ohio, we should actually require them to stay in Ohio post-graduation,” the Senate president said.
The scholarship recipients would be required to stay in Ohio after graduation for three years. If they didn’t?
“There would be an expectation that that person would have to pay back a portion or all of the aid that they received,” McColley said.
Both House GOP and Democratic leaders question how this would be enforceable.
“I assume we’re not going to go across the state line to Detroit and try to drag somebody back,” Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman said, noting that it would be nearly “impossible to implement.”
This is also disappointing for Huang, who already had doubts about staying within Ohio. She is only planning to apply to one school in Ohio, she said.
“After Ohio Senate Bill 1, I think a lot of us are really, really considering going out of state for school,” the rising senior said.
High school students reconsidering applying to Ohio universities due to new higher education law

S.B. 1 was signed into law by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine earlier this year. The new law bans diversity efforts, prohibits faculty strikes, and regulates classroom discussion of “controversial” topics, among other things. The law applies to public universities and community colleges and is set to take effect this month.
The elimination of DEI would mean no diversity offices, trainings or scholarships — including ones that Huang was hoping for.
“There are programs and there are topics that we’d be able to learn about and discuss about in other schools that we would otherwise not be able to here in Ohio,” she said.
There are other ways that the state could retain graduates, she added.
“I think that the legislators should make sure that we’re protecting the interests of young people by not writing bills that are upending our education system,” the high schooler said.
The Ohio Senate passed its version of the state budget on Wednesday. The Ohio House and Senate will need to pass a compromise budget bill by July 1.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)This session, the Kansas Legislature voted to send Senate Concurrent Resolution 1611 to voters. This proposed constitutional amendment creates the direct partisan political election of Kansas Supreme Court justices. Such elections would be the death knell of an independent judiciary.
I was fortunate to serve as a trial district court judge for two and a half decades. I was faced with making difficult decisions, but also very unpopular ones. The majority of the Legislature sadly confuses the court of law with the court of public opinion.
Partisan election of judges conflicts with the very essence of the role of the judiciary. A judge has no constituency. A judge must not be influenced by popular opinion. A judge must not be beholden to a political party or a financial campaign contributor. Surely we can all agree we want our judiciary to be fair, impartial and insulated from outside influence.
This distinction of judicial office from legislative and executive positions is recognized by the Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct, canon 4. It addresses political activity by a judicial candidate that is inconsistent with the independence, integrity or impartiality of the judiciary. Rule 4.1 (A)(6) states “(A) judge or judicial candidate shall not, in connection with cases, controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court make pledges, promises, or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the court.”










A judge has no constituency. A judge must not be influenced by popular opinion. A judge must not be beholden to a political party or a financial campaign contributor.


– Steven Becker


This means no pledges, promises or commitments on gun control, abortion, Medicaid expansion or legalization of cannabis. The Kansas Code of Judicial Conduct explains further the importance of keeping our judiciary above the fray of political campaigns and rhetoric.
“A judge plays a role different from that of a legislator or executive branch official. Rather than making decisions based upon the expressed views or preferences of the electorate, a judge makes decisions based upon the law and the facts of every case. In furtherance of this interest, judges and judicial candidates, must, to the greatest extent possible, be free and appear to be free from political influence and political pressure. … Public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is eroded if judges or judicial candidates are perceived to be subject to political influence.”
I suggest the ethical veil distinguishing a judicial candidate from a candidate for legislative or executive office is extremely important but extremely thin.
While serving as a district court judge, I applied twice for a vacancy on the Kansas Court of Appeals. At the time, the selection process was the merit-based system that we currently have for selecting our Supreme Court justices. My efforts were unsuccessful. After going through the interview process and an aggressive background investigation, I willingly admit that candidates better than I were chosen to be considered for appointment by the governor. The merit-based selection system works and has worked for more than 50 years.
The only reason a change to our state constitution is being sought is because the Kansas Supreme Court issued opinions that conflict with the court of public opinion — or the opinion of lawmakers in Topeka.
If court decisions are to align with public opinions, I suggest that our public schools would still be segregated. The independence of our judiciary, free from outside political and ideological influence, is a bedrock to our democracy.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
A small town tries to revive its hospital in the middle of a rural health crisis

Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.
 Births are expensive

The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.










You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services.


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform


“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
 Ripple effects

Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
 State action

Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

(Photo courtesy U.S. Department of Energy)Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) issued guidance Wednesday to help businesses preparing for a 3% tax set to take effect next month on the sale and use of several informational technology services.
“As we implement the new tax changes from this year’s General Assembly session, my team and I are focused on ensuring that business owners have the information and guidance they need to collect and remit the tax as simply as possible,” Lierman said in a written statement.
Sometimes referred to as the “tech tax,” the 3% tax on IT services is a result of the General Assembly’s efforts this past session to raise revenue amid a $3 billion state budget deficit. It is projected to raise about $500 million as part of $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees approved for fiscal 2026.
Vice chair of House panel says tech tax drove decision to move business to Virginia

To help businesses prepare for the tax hike, the Comptroller’s Office issued a “technical bulletin” Wednesday explaining the ins and outs of the sales tax, and which IT programs will be affected. A lot, according to the bulletin: cloud storage, data entry, data processing, media streaming data storage and technical support, telephone-based recorded information services, cryptocurrency mining, news and press clipping services, media archives such as for film and music, computer software design services, and dozens more.
The tax passed over the objections of Republican lawmakers and business owners who argued that it will drive IT businesses away from Maryland, even as Gov. Wes Moore (D) says he’s trying bring more businesses into the state. Even some Democrats were skeptical: Del. Brian M. Crosby (D-St. Mary’s) made waves when he announced on the House floor that the specter of the tax was the deciding factor to move his small business, which would have been subject to the tax, out of Maryland and into Virginia.
Ultimately, the tax, originally proposed as a business-to-business tax, was expanded to include IT sales to consumers as well, and passed. The tax does not apply to sales to tax-exempt organizations, including government agencies, and to businesses in the University of Maryland’s Discovery District in Prince George’s County.
The Comptroller’s office has also submitted emergency regulations to implement the 3% IT tax, which are under final review by the Office of the Attorney General.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/29842821730_30908f4b88_o-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-12 04:21:41+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT needs more meadows, fewer lawns",William Sweet,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/12/ct-needs-more-meadows-fewer-lawns/,"At a time of climate change, biodiversity loss, and extreme weather, choosing a meadow is no longer just an aesthetic decision — it is an act of climate resilience.","The word “lawn” comes from the Welsh llan, which originally meant “barren land:” how fitting that word is for what most American homeowners have! 
European aristocrats displayed their wealth in part through lawns: only they could afford to have their land be wholly unproductive. Eager to emulate aristocrats, the American middle class created machines and chemicals to make such land less expensive to maintain. We denuded the very land that could nourish us, drove away the insects and birds, and sterilized the soil. But true affluence today lies in authenticity, not imitation; it lies in fostering nature. The meadow is no longer wild: it is curated.

William Sweet
The U.S. has over 63,000 square miles of turf grass, an area larger than the state of Georgia. Twenty percent of Connecticut is lawn. Only 19 percent of American homeowners do not have yards or grass. The rub: lawns are exceedingly harmful to the environment. 
For instance:

A recent toxicology analysis found that half of the weed killers sold at the largest home and garden stores, Home Depot and Lowe’s, include chemicals classified as “highly hazardous pesticides” that are linked to detrimental health effects on humans. The ingredients in commonly used herbicides, such as 2,4-D — a chemical from the Vietnam War defoliant Agent Orange — are associated with neurotoxicity, reproductive issues, and cancer.
To attain lush green lawns, homeowners use three million tons a year of nitrogen-based fertilizers. For every ton of nitrogen created to make this fertilizer, four to six tons of carbon are added to the atmosphere. Further, a lawn neither needs nor can hold the amount of nitrogen in the fertilizer: soil microbes turn the additional nitrogen into nitrous-oxide gas, a greenhouse gas that, unit for unit, traps 300 times as much heat as CO2.
Lawns intensify droughts. Americans use 20 trillion gallons of water on their lawns each year. By way of comparison, 30 trillion gallons of water are used to irrigate crops in the U.S. The critical point: this is drinking water. Further, water is often woefully underpriced, leading to overuse.
Lawn maintenance emits five to six times more CO2 than the grass absorbs. Gas-powered lawn mowers make up five percent of the total air pollution in the U.S. — and even more than five percent in urban areas. While four-stroke engines are slightly more environmentally efficient than two-stroke engines, a four-stroke lawnmower operating for one hour releases as much CO2 as the average car traveling 500 miles.

Now imagine if these lawns were meadows instead. Pennsylvania has a model program, the Lawn Conversion Program, that encourages homeowners to convert their lawn into a meadow. Seth Cassell, the Director of the Program, has been delighted by “the tremendous response we’ve seen to our program to convert mowed lawn areas to native meadows. By restoring habitat on some of the millions of acres of grass in Pennsylvania alone we are addressing and offsetting some of the damages of climate change, helping pollinators and wildlife, and connecting more people to nature.” 
Unlike lawns, meadows require very little upkeep — no irrigation, fertilizers, mowing, or maintenance. Meadows require little to no irrigation, helping to alleviate water shortages and reducing household water bills. And they certainly do not require pesticides and herbicides.
The science is clear: meadows are ecological powerhouses hiding in plain sight. Thanks to their deep, dense root systems — some of which reach to 12 feet — they can reduce peak stormwater flows by up to 96 percent, filtering pollutants before they reach our rivers. Meadows also cool the environment far better than do lawns. At a time of climate change, biodiversity loss, and extreme weather, choosing a meadow is no longer just an aesthetic decision — it is an act of climate resilience. Further, a lawn can be up to 22 times more expensive to maintain than a native meadow: maintaining a lawn costs approximately $637 to $1,206 an acre each year, whereas maintaining a meadow costs only $54 to $167 an acre.
“We’ve had huge interest in the Lawn-to-Habitat Program since it launched in 2020. Over 3,000 Pennsylvanians have expressed interest in replacing portions of their lawns with native plants. So far, we have supported over 470 acres of lawn-to-meadow plantings through our funding programs. It doesn’t matter whether you own a small lot in town or several acres in the country, anyone can swap a little lawn for native meadow.” —Kelsey Mummert, Lawn-to-Habitat Program Coordinator.
Convinced that homeowners should convert their lawns into native meadows, I began to advocate for the creation of legislation to offer homeowners in Connecticut multi-purpose credits for doing so. I formed an advisory council of 20 experts to advise me on this legislation. Sen. Richard Blumenthal met with me to discuss the legislation; he recommended that I reach out to Connecticut Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff and State Rep. Tom O’Dea. Both Duff and O’Dea were exceedingly helpful; indeed, O’Dea shared my research with a legislative committee — and my legislation became Proposed House Bill No. 6271!
“This legislation is more than just a policy — it is a signal that Connecticut is serious about turning environmental ambition into tangible action. By recognizing the power of every backyard, we are weaving resilience, beauty, and sustainability into the very fabric of our communities,” Duff said.
In the not-too-distant future, native meadows will emerge as a signature of thoughtful design and lasting value — just as chef ’s kitchens and walk-in closets became staples of the discerning homebuyer. Buyers will ask: Does this property support pollinators? Does it bloom across the seasons? Does the landscape regenerate itself — or does it demand constant input and expense?
A meadow is more than an ecosystem: it is a statement, a living emblem of modern wealth, one that signals intelligence, taste, and freedom. In a country built on personal liberty, why settle for conformity? Meadows offer freedom from maintenance, freedom from cost, and freedom to express a new kind of American elegance. More than just beautiful, they become a conversation starter, a point of pride.

What erstwhile greatness are we talking about? 
Was America great when ordinary families gave up 57,000 kids to a bloodbath 7,000 miles from home in Southeast Asia? Was America great when schoolchildren were segregated by skin color and all required to recite a Christian prayer every morning before school? Was America great when its leaders went on a rampage against Arabs because three skyscrapers collapsed in New York after two got hit by airplanes? Was America great just a few years ago when millions of people were persuaded or forced to receive injections to fight what some public health experts consider a man-made disease?
What sort of greatness are we talking about?
Putting aside the question of whether there ever was a time when America was great, the idea that casting a vote has any chance of making America great seems a bit delusional. If it were that easy, Americans would have done it long ago, and we’d have an honest and responsible citizen in every elective office in the land. 
Judging from the gap between public policy and public opinion, elections haven’t produced much greatness. That’s not to say that there’s nothing a citizen can do to make America great. (Let’s not say “again” again, but “at last” instead: MAGAL) Is there a way you and I can make America great at last?
Here’s an idea. Make it a practice to ask people what they’re reading and say a few words about what you’re reading. We’re told that we don’t read much. If that’s true, we put our country at risk. With the exception of the current president, most people would be embarrassed to admit that they’re not reading anything. Repeated episodes of what-are-you-reading challenges could shame some of them into reading. What might be the result if people issued the challenge routinely for five or ten years? Would there be an epidemic of reading? If so, could this make America great at last? Couldn’t hurt.
Of course, there are impediments. According to our media, only about one in three of us can read above a sixth grade level, and one in five of us can’t read at all. Luckily, we have the means to administer remedial instruction, and it can happen anonymously on line or even in Dyslexics Anonymous groups. The library of books recorded aloud for people with poor eyesight is huge and growing.
I tried the MAGAL challenge on two of my grownup grandchildren. They’re college students, but they don’t read for pleasure. So far, the what-are-you-reading inquiry hasn’t worked, but I’m not finished with them yet. It’s possible that they’re immune to shaming, or maybe they just don’t take grandpa seriously, but I’m determined to get them to read something for fun, even if it’s not War and Peace. I might force them to read my poems. Aloud.

Garcia said his wife’s aunt, a mother of three, was among those still being held by federal authorities and battling against deportation following the raid at Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods plant. So is the mom of a college fraternity friend, he said.
Both Garcia and his wife, Yanira, are elected officials and community leaders. Yanira is an Omaha representative on the Regional Metropolitan Transit Authority Board.
Of their detained family member, Garcia said she has lived in the area for decades and was raising a family here with her husband.
“She’s contributed back to the Omaha community and economy,” he said. “We can assure you she was not involved in any high-level criminal activity.”
Garcia was among local officials who spoke at a news conference the day after federal agents led the largest Nebraska immigration enforcement operation since President Donald Trump took office after Trump pledged massive deportations and a crackdown on immigration.
 Ewing, a critic

  Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. (Courtesy of City of Omaha)
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. — who was sworn into office Monday night — said he “certainly” does not support worksite immigration raids in the city he was elected to lead. He defeated three-term Republican Mayor Jean Stothert.
Ewing said he has no influence, however, over whether or how such immigration enforcement is carried out. 
Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said he received “extremely general” information about 10 days ago that an enforcement activity was ahead. He said Omaha police on Tuesday offered only traffic enforcement assistance.
“We’re hoping that it doesn’t happen, obviously, because of the chaos it creates in this community,” said Ewing, a former Omaha police commander who most recently was Douglas County treasurer, explaining his perspective. 
Some South Omaha businesses still had their doors closed Wednesday. A community center canceled youth soccer practice. Ewing thanked organizations for efforts helping families and children affected. 
Meanwhile on Wednesday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released its own statement decrying “reckless rhetoric being thrown around” and describing a different scenario, including a “threat” during the raid by a worker with a box cutter. It also released video from the raid.
 Assault 

A statement from acting ICE director Todd Lyons said a Honduras native during the Tuesday raid “brandished a weapon and assaulted federal agents and officers who were doing their job.”
“Let’s be clear — this wasn’t just someone ‘out of status,’” Lyons said. “This was a violent criminal who attacked law enforcement while they were serving the public…”
Federal immigration raid hits Omaha plant

When asked to detail the alleged assault, an ICE spokesperson shared the legal definition of assault as an attempt to cause serious bodily harm to someone, whether through a deliberate act or irresponsible actions without respect for a victim’s safety. The spokesperson said no agent was hurt in the operation that led to the detention of 76 people. ICE characterized the raid as successful and said some of those detained had active local warrants, prior DUI convictions or had been previously deported.
“Many now may face additional federal charges: fraud and misuse of visas, permits and other documents; assaulting a federal officer; resisting arrest; illegal reentry; and/or misuse of Social Security numbers,” the agency statement said.
Worksite enforcement is a priority, ICE said, as the government seeks to “protect the nation’s workforce, eradicate labor trafficking and hold employers accountable for practices that encourage illegal immigration.”
Involved in the Omaha crackdown, according to ICE, were the Nebraska State Patrol, Nebraska Department of Vehicles (driver and vehicle records fraud investigation unit) as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Marshals Service, Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
 Governor, Mexican Consul respond

Mexican Consul Jorge Ernesto Espejel Montes told the Nebraska Examiner that about 40 of those detained are Mexico natives — mostly men — and that his staff has started talking to each. He said he believed some were being held in the ICE facility near the Omaha airport and that he thought some might eventually be taken to a Pottawattamie County facility.
As of mid-day Wednesday, two had decided to voluntarily deport and were to be returned to Mexico, Espejel said, adding that as far as he knows, the Mexican workers were being treated okay.

Some of those held, he said, had permission to be in the U.S. and will fight deportation with legal assistance from the Consul and community groups. Espejel said a next step is to contact Glenn Valley Foods, as the workers were owed pay. 
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen also released a statement Wednesday, saying he supported “the work of our federal partners” and backed Trump’s efforts. He pointed blame at the Biden administration. 
“The country’s immigration policy absolutely failed the American people for four years,” Pillen said. “We have to address the issue of illegal immigration, and I support the work of our federal partners to ensure that the law is followed.” 
Asked about the conflicting responses, Ewing said he had not read Pillen’s statement nor had he talked to him about the immigration raid. He said he would try to work with Pillen as he has with other elected leaders.
“But we are going to look at what we believe is best for the people of Omaha,” Ewing said. 











We’re hoping that it doesn’t happen, obviously, because of the chaos it creates in this community.


– Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., on worksite raids



	He and the police chief reiterated that Omaha police would not as a normal course of business ask someone for proof of immigration status. They said that is not the role of local police, and that they want to encourage trust and a climate in which people will report crimes and participate with law enforcement.
 Why target Omaha? 

Garcia said he, as head of the Douglas County Board, was not provided notice that immigration enforcement activity was coming. Douglas County Sheriff Aaron Hanson has said that he knew several days prior. Garcia said that information was not conveyed to him.
Ewing said he did not know or want to speculate on why federal officials targeted Omaha. The raid came as the city prepares for the launch this week of one of its biggest national tourist attractions: the College World Series baseball tournament.
“I don’t know why,” he said. “I can speculate, which I don’t do.”

Garcia said he was unsure as well. But in an interview Wednesday morning with MSNBC, he noted it happened just as the city’s Democratic and first elected Black mayor took the helm of the city. The interviewer noted that Omaha was a blue enclave in a red state. Garcia also noted he was the first Latino Douglas County commissioner.
Among those attending Ewing’s news conference were members of LULAC, the League of United Latin American Citizens, described as the nation’s largest and oldest Hispanic civil rights organization.
LULAC national spokesman David Cruz said the group was headed to Washington, D.C. after its Omaha visit and asked what message Ewing would want delivered. 
Ewing said he’d like a comprehensive immigration policy that “actually works.” He said he does not want “soft-on-crime” measures, but prefers a “humanitarian” approach. He said current policies have led to fear.
“Do something that helps hardworking people in these communities be able to have an opportunity to become citizens of this country,” he said. “They are contributing to our cities. They are contributing to our state and to our nation.”
Others spoke during the press conference as well, including Danny Begley of the Omaha City Council, City Human Rights and Relations Director Cailin Daly Dejillas and Community Relations and Outreach Coordinator Jennifer Rodriguez. Most of the event was presented in Spanish as well as English.
 ‘Honest narrative’ 

Garcia, in sharing that his family member was arrested, said he wanted to provide an “honest narrative” of community impact.
At last check, the aunt, in her mid 40s, was detained at the ICE facility near Eppley Airfield, said Yanira Garcia. The woman’s husband and children, the youngest still a minor, are worried and seeking legal advice.
Yanira described her mom’s younger sister as a “happy spirit” who makes a cake or Jell-O for family get-togethers. She crocheted an outfit for the Garcias’ two daughters when each was born.

It’s not that she hasn’t tried to adjust her immigration status, said Yanira. Petitioning for a Mexican relative to become a legal resident is a lengthy process, and Yanira said her aunt’s U.S. citizen sisters and mother began that petition process 20 years ago.
“The immigration process and laws are very complicated, especially for Mexican citizens,” she said.
Roger Garcia said he wants to work with law enforcement to tackle “high-level crimes” and to keep the community safe “while also having a heart” for working undocumented immigrants.
Rumors continued to circulate on Wednesday, with social media users sharing posts about what they believed were new immigration enforcement activity and related information. In several cases, a reporter checked out the information and found it to be untrue. 
Many have expressed concerns about undocumented immigrant workers who allegedly used stolen identities to get jobs. To that, Lina Traslaviña Stover of the Heartland Workers Center said, “Let due process take care of those individuals.”

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The future of a controversial bill that extends a loophole for out-of-state waste to be brought to Juniper Ridge Landfill is uncertain.
After both chambers passed the bill (LD 297), with the Senate voting 22-10 on Wednesday, less than two-thirds of the House voted to enact the bill, which is required for an emergency measure. 
During the Senate debate, Sen. Rick Benett (R-Oxford), who opposed the legislation, read a letter from Wabanaki Alliance executive director Maulian Bryant, who said the proposal would extend an unjust loophole that is poisoning the Penobscot River. Others who spoke criticized Casella Waste Management, which runs the landfill, for not doing more to change its practices to meet the requirements of a 2022 law banning out-of-state waste. The imported bulky waste — such as construction materials — helps the landfill manage the excess of sludge. Sen. Denise Tepler (D-Sagadahoc) said she’s “not convinced the operator of the landfill is an honest broker.” 
Tepler and others acknowledged that the bill was not an adequate solution, but she argued that under the current system, it’s difficult to separate the in- and out-of-state waste and said the state is up against several contractual obligations so, if no action is taken, it would mean “serious problems at the landfill.” More bulky waste battles to come.

With papers frantically shuffling between chambers this week ahead of the planned June 18 adjournment, Maine Morning Star will highlight the biggest items of debate as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what happened Wednesday. 
Both chambers
After extensive back and forth, both chambers threw their support behind a proposal to protect Maine’s night sky from light pollution. House lawmakers voted late Wednesday to align with the Senate in favor of LD 1934, which would require that exterior lighting on public buildings and projects comply with certain standards intended to reduce the amount of unnecessary light emitted, with exemptions for airports, highways, ski areas, emergency management, and — after the passage of a floor amendment — the Maine Turnpike. Sen. Stacey Guerin (R-Penobscot) pointed out that New Hampshire passed a similar measure and “the sky did not fall, but the night sky is shining brightly.” 
Legislation to increase the transparency and accountability of the Maine Information and Analysis Center, a controversial fusion center that was accused by a whistleblower of illegally monitoring and tracking civilians, passed both chambers. LD 419 creates an auditor position within the Attorney General’s Office to produce publicly available reports on its actions and ensures the center operates within the law and in a manner that preserves the privacy, civil liberties and civil rights of all people in the state.
Following the Senate vote one day before, the House on Wednesday passed legislation (LD 1666) to expand ranked-choice voting to races for general and special elections for governor, state senator and state representative. Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said the bill does more than enact “the people’s will. It restores coherence to our electoral system.” However, critics argued that because that state constitution says those races should be decided by a “plurality” of voters, that the bill is unconstitutional. 
Both chambers have rejected a constitutional amendment (LD 150) that would allow voters to choose the state treasurer. The Senate on Wednesday voted 16-17 against passage of the bill, following the House vote earlier this week.
The chambers both voted without a roll call to pass LD 1702, which adds restrictions to what candidates or their representatives can do at polling places on Election Day, including collecting petition signatures or contributions for their candidacy within 250 feet of the entrance to a polling place.
Both chambers backed legislation (LD 1731) that would give greater oversight to the Maine State Ferry Advisory Board, requiring the Maine State Ferry Service to consult the board on matters regarding budgets, planning and major operational decisions while the board will conduct annual reviews of the ferry service. This action comes after the ferry service experienced serious disruptions last summer and has struggled to hire and retain staff. (Read more about the issue here.)
LD 1099, which would exempt diapers from sales tax, passed both chambers without a roll call.  
With the House voting 75-65 and the Senate 19-14, both chambers are supporting a proposal (LD 1328) to create culturally appropriate and trauma-informed housing recovery residences to provide services to underserved, underrepresented or disparately impacted individuals in recovery from substance use disorder.
The majority of the House and Senate have voted against a proposal (LD 856) to phase out the income tax.
An emergency bill (LD 1920) to prohibit the sale to a person under 21 years old of potentially intoxicating hemp products passed both chambers without a roll call, and was unanimously enacted by both chambers, meaning it will take effect immediately after signing.
Both the House and Senate passed legislation (LD 1326) that would establish maximum PFAS levels in the drinking water of certain public water systems that serve settings such as schools, factories, industrial parks or office buildings. (Read more about the issue here.)
The chambers also unanimously approved a resolve (LD 1888) directing the Office of the Attorney General to convene a working group to study the feasibility of establishing the crime of racketeering for drug offenses and sex trafficking. 
One of several proposals to amend the constitution to require the popular election of the secretary of state, attorney general and state treasurer (LD 508) ultimately failed after a series of back and forth votes. Though it initially passed the House, which also added a floor amendment that would have ensured those races used ranked-choice voting, it was rejected by the Senate and then indefinitely postponed, which the House later agreed to.
Nonconcurrent matters
The House on Wednesday insisted on passage of a tax proposal rejected by the Senate (LD 1879) that would increase corporate tax rates and use that revenue to support the state’s agricultural industries. (Read more about the bill here.)
The House on Wednesday insisted on its position in support of a resolve (LD 1364) directing the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to evaluate efforts to promote the use of non-lead ammunition. Following that, the Senate also insisted on its position against the bill, likely dooming the legislation.
Despite significant debate and fatigue over a bill (LD 1754) that would provide for the direct shipment of spirits to consumers, the House voted to insist on its position against the measure that the Senate has backed (a position the upper chamber later doubled down on). Critics argued the legislation would take money from mom and pop retailers that have paid significant money for liquor licenses.
The chambers are also at odds over legislation (LD 1657) that would expand the use of tax increment revenue for affordable housing by adding authorized project costs, such as costs for the development, sale, and operation. The House late Wednesday insisted on its position against the measure that is backed by the Senate.
The chambers are also split over a proposal (LD 1200) to prohibit the sale of items intended to be used to inhale nitrous oxide for recreational use. The Senate first passed the bill without a roll call but the House voted 50-93 against the measure. Arguing against, Rep. Nina Milliken (D-Blue Hill) told her colleagues the bill would create a new civil offense, such as that if she went to the grocery store and purchased whipped cream with the intention of huffing the gas, and the clerk who sold it to her knew she would do that, they could get a civil penalty. She argued, “when a bad bill comes around, you must whip it.”
Senate action
Senators voted 21-10 to pass a measure (LD 913) that would prohibit ticket sellers from banning the transfer of tickets to third parties. An amendment introduced on the floor that would have capped the price of resale tickets failed 11-20.
House action
House members voted 75-67 to back a provision (LD 229) that would add new tax brackets to increase taxes on the state’s highest earners and increase the threshold for the state’s lower tax brackets, which sponsor Rep. Ann Matlack (D-Spruce Head) explained was crafted to provide income tax relief to those in the middle.
However, a measure (LD 1089) that would establish a tax on incomes over $1,000,000 to permanently fund the state’s share of education failed 70-72. 
The House on Wednesday voted without a roll call to reject a proposed constitutional amendment (LD 1112) that would require the state to reimburse municipalities for at least 90% of lost revenue due to property tax exemptions, and also establish a minimum homestead tax exemption.
The House initially voted under the hammer to pass LD 172, which would require the Maine State Police to create a statewide list of missing persons and study improvements for investigating those cases, but then moved to table the measure. (Read more about this issue here). 
Members of the House voted 73-69 in favor of (LD 648) to expand the state’s supervised community confinement program for incarcerated people who committed offenses before they were 26 years old.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds on Wednesday vetoed a controversial bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa.
House Republican leaders initiated an effort to reconvene the Legislature to override the veto, but Senate GOP leaders indicated that was unlikely.
House File 639 would have increased insurance requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines, limited carbon pipeline permits to one 25-year term and changed the definition of a common carrier for pipelines, making it more difficult for the projects to use eminent domain.
Reynolds, in a statement, said she shared the bill’s goal of “protecting landowners” but the bill lacked the “clear, careful lines” drawn in good policy.
“It combines valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets,” Reynolds said in a letter announcing her decision to veto.
Reynolds followed her critique of the bill by noting that Iowa could lose its “leadership position” as a top biofuel production state if legislation stopped the infrastructure necessary to enter ultra-low carbon markets.
Central to the bill is a carbon sequestration pipeline project led by Summit Carbon Solutions that would transport liquid carbon dioxide, captured from biorefineries in Iowa and five other states including South Dakota, to underground storage in North Dakota.
Reynolds said the bill would stop Iowa from leading in biofuels
Farmers and the biofuels industry have been supportive of the Summit pipeline, and therefore opposed to the bill, because it would give Iowa access to the carbon capture and sequestration technologies necessary to make products like sustainable aviation fuels.
In a statement following the governor’s veto, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said without carbon capture projects, and entry to ultra-low carbon fuel industry, Iowa could face “very real, very severe economic consequences.”
South Dakota regulators deny carbon pipeline permit again, but company vows to reapply

“This is a classic example of why our system of government has checks and balances,” Shaw said. “Any thoughtful review of this bill would determine that it would lead to higher energy prices for Iowans, hamper future economic development, hold back job creation, and stifle new markets for Iowa farmers. IRFA thanks Gov. Reynolds for listening to Iowans, studying the actual legislation, and ignoring the rhetoric that was as inaccurate as it was loud.”
A press release from Iowa Corn Growers Association said entrance to the aviation fuel industry alone could result in nearly 6.5 million bushels of new corn demand, which it said is necessary for farmers dealing with high input costs and decreased profit margins.
Farmers “need expanded market growth and access to continue raising corn profitably; allowing them to continue growing Iowa’s agricultural industry and economy,” the statement said.
Opponents of the bill, including several lawmakers, argued the bill was aimed solely at carbon sequestration projects, rather than protecting landowners from eminent domain as supporters claimed.
“Eminent domain” allows the government to force private landowners to allow use of their property, for a fee set by the courts, for infrastructure projects deemed in the public interest. Eminent domain has long been used projects such as public roads and utilities.
Leadership from Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, said its CO2 pipeline project connecting to Nebraska’s Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline would be impacted by the bill’s insurance and permit limit clauses, even though the SIRE project secured voluntary easements for 100% of its path in Iowa.
Reynolds cited this example in her explanation, and said the “arbitrary” term limits and insurance requirements would make it “difficult for companies like SIRE to justify the additional investment” in Iowa.
“Those who crafted the bill said they don’t want to stop CO2 pipelines that rely entirely on voluntary easements,” Reynolds said. “But that is exactly what the bill does.”
Summit Carbon Solutions thanked the governor for her “thoughtful and thorough review” of the bill. In a statement, the company said the pipeline project “opens the door to new markets and helps strengthen America’s energy dominance for the long term.”
“Summit remains committed to working with landowners through voluntary agreements—just as we have with more than 1,300 Iowa landowners to date, resulting in $175 million in payments,” a spokesperson said in the statement. “We look forward to continued discussions with state leaders as we advance this important project.”
Reynolds said more needs to be done to limit the use of eminent domain
Opponents to the pipeline project, who were supportive of HF 639, argue the pipeline would negatively impact their properties and health, and that sequestering CO2 does not constitute a “public use” deserving of eminent domain rights.
Landowners opposed to the project lobbied state lawmakers for four years before a bill was debated, and ultimately passed, in the Senate and sent to the governor.
Since the bill landed on the governor’s desk, landowners have encouraged Reynolds to support Iowa GOP values on protecting property rights.
Reynolds said the debate of when the government, or companies with government approval, can take private property is a “debate as old as the Republic.” 
“I’ve consistently said that if eminent domain is used, it must be rare, fair and a last resort,” Reynolds said. “But HF 639 isn’t just about eminent domain.”
Reynolds said the bill sets a precedent that “threatens” the state’s “energy reliability, economy and reputation as a place where businesses can invest with confidence.”
Mary Powell, a Shelby County landowner opposed to the pipeline, said the veto shows that the state motto of, “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain” are “just empty words” to the governor.
“Governor Reynolds chose to support the millionaires and billionaires at the expense of Iowans and their property rights,” Powell said in a statement.
Another landowner, Don Johanssen from Cherokee County, said the governor’s decision was “beyond words,” especially as the bill would have given landowners “some liability coverage” from hazardous pipelines.


Let us know what you think...


 

The bill would have required pipeline operator to carry insurance that covered any loss or injury from accidental, negligent or intentional discharges from the pipeline, and to cover insurance increases that landowners face due to the pipeline.
“This is a sad day for Iowa that will be long remembered,” Johanssen said.
Reynolds said the bill would impact “more than just CO2 infrastructure” and would change permitting rules “across the board,” giving “uncertainty into critical energy projects.”
Opponents of the bill called the insurance requirements “untenable.”
The American Petroleum Institute’s Midwest Regional Director Mike Karbo said the bill had “unprecedented and unfeasible requirements” that would have hindered future projects in the state.
“Since there are no refineries in the state, critical energy infrastructure, such as pipelines, are crucial in ensuring Iowans have a reliable source of energy, and certainty is needed to develop the infrastructure network,” Karbo said. “We thank the Governor for doing what is right for the future of energy development in the state.”
Reynolds said HF 639 included “a few helpful provisions” and the surrounding debate “highlighted” areas for progress.
“I agree we can do more to limit the use of eminent domain, promote transparency, and ensure responsible land restoration,” Reynolds said. “We can do better.”
Reynolds, who is not running for reelection in 2026, said she is “committed” to working with legislation to “strengthen landowner protections, modernize permitting and respect private property.”
Taking one element from HF 639, Reynolds will ask the IUC to require all commissioners to be present for live testimony and ensure at least one commissioner is present at every informational meeting.
House Speaker Pat Grassley starts petition to reconvene, override veto
In a statement from Iowa House Republicans, Speaker Pat Grassley said he has requested members sign a petition to reconvene the Legislature in a special session.
“This veto is a major setback for Iowa,” Grassley said in the statement. “It is a setback not only for landowners who have been fighting across Iowa, but for the work the House of Representatives has put in for four years to get legislation like HF 639 passed. We will not stop fighting and stand firm on our commitment until landowners’ in Iowa are protected against Eminent Domain for private gain.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said he was “very disappointed” in the governor’s decision and that he was supportive of a special session to override the veto.
Two-thirds of the Legislature must sign a petition to request a special session, and to override a veto, two-thirds of the members from each chamber must vote to pass the bill again.
South Dakota governor signs eminent domain ban on carbon pipelines

Sen. Jack Whitver, R-Grimes, the majority leader for the chamber, said he expects most of his caucus will “not be interested in any attempt” to override the governor’s veto.
The bill likely would not have advanced in the Senate had it not been for a dozen Republican senators who vowed to block necessary budget legislation until the chamber debated eminent domain. The 12 were also joined by Senate Democrats in pushing for amendments, which were ultimately defeated, and approval of the bill. 
Senate Democrats said the fight for property rights will continue.
“I’m disappointed by the governor’s veto of HF639, but, unfortunately, I cannot say I’m surprised,” Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, said. “There is simply no amount of political posturing or legislative stonewalling that can deny the fact that Iowans’ right to private property should never be infringed upon for private gain.”
One of the 12 to disagree with the Senate majority, Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, said signing the bill was “the single option available” to protect the rights of impacted landowners. Alons pledged to “never quit working” on the issue, but said that means “very little” to landowners who have been impacted by the “unprecedented, and unconstitutional land grab.”
“To be clear: the Iowa government has given this private company the right to take people’s land for one reason: corporate earnings,” Alons said in a statement. “This has nothing to do with public use. It’s absolutely not necessary for the ethanol industry in our state … And it certainly is not what the founders had in mind.”
Alons said when the Legislature returns in January, he and other lawmakers “will use every tool at our disposal” to “return property rights back to the people.”
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, who sponsored the legislation, wrote in a social media post he was “profoundly disappointed” by the veto. Holt said the state constitution and the Republican platform are clear in their message that eminent domain is for public use projects.
“Today the Governor has chosen to ignore landowners, the vast majority of the Legislature, the Republican Party Platform and the Iowa Constitution by choosing the economic development argument of special interests,” Holt wrote.
Holt said Reynolds, and the Senate had opportunities of the past several years to offer their own suggestions to the eminent domain issue instead of opposing House legislation.
“On behalf of the people of Iowa and their fundamental property rights, the Governor’s veto should be overridden,” he wrote. “This fight for who we are as Republicans is far from over.”
House Democratic Leader Rep. Brian Meyer said parties in the House collaborated to “protect property rights.”
“At the end of the day, there is only one group to blame for the failure of the eminent domain bill: Iowa Republican lawmakers,” Meyer said in a statement.
The first phase of the Summit Carbon Solutions project was approved by IUC nearly a year ago, which granted Summit the right to condemn easements from landowners who do not want to voluntarily sign agreements to put the pipeline on their land. Per the Iowa permit, Summit still needs a permit from South Dakota, which it has been denied twice, to begin construction.

Land sales would raise federal revenue and open up parcels for housing, according to Utah senator’s plan. But critics say it would result in the loss of lands now used for hunting and outdoor recreation.
The post New provision in Senate budget bill could put Wyoming public lands up for sale appeared first on WyoFile .","Senate Republicans will consider mandating a sell-off of an estimated 2.5 million acres of public land, including possible parcels in Wyoming, in the budget bill they are now reconciling, a proposal Utah Sen. Mike Lee released Wednesday night shows.
The plan from Lee describes selling the land as both a way to raise money to fill federal coffers and to open up land for housing in western communities that have struggled with enough supply. Lee, who chairs the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, has long sought to trim the amount of federal land owned by all Americans. 
Ahead of Wednesday’s announcement, conservation groups and hunter advocacy organizations were lining up to oppose the public land sale, which has in the past been a politically unpopular idea throughout the West. 
“Public lands need to stay in public hands and the Muley Fanatic Foundation opposes anything or anyone that threatens our lands that we hold dear for personal use,” Joey Faigle, president and CEO of the foundation, told WyoFile in a statement Monday, two days before Lee released his language. The nonprofit is based in southwest Wyoming and represents hunters.  
“Selling off our lands without consulting the communities who use them will risk permanently losing the places we use for hunting, outdoor recreation, and so much more,” Faigle wrote. “It will also affect those traditions to be passed on to our future generations. The public land sales being included in the reconciliation needs to stop now.” 
Lee’s proposal mandates federal land managers offload land from 11 possible western states, with the notable exception of Montana.

Congressional delegates from Wyoming’s northern neighbor – including former interior secretary and current Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke – have rejected efforts to sell federal land. Zinke’s opposition to a similar proposal in the House last month led to that body ultimately jettisoning the idea when it passed its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sprawling budget measure designed to advance President Donald Trump’s priorities of rapidly increasing the deportation of immigrants, beefing up military and security spending and extending tax cuts that critics say mostly benefit wealthy Americans and corporations.
Iconic public lands appear largely exempt from sale under Lee’s proposal. National parks, national monuments, wildlife refuges, national seashores and lakeshores, national battlefields and nine other designated areas are all excluded. Lands that have ongoing leases or use claims, such as for grazing or mining or mineral extraction, also can’t be sold. 
Wyoming politicians and public land
Wyoming Rep. Harriet Hageman, a Republican, backed the House proposal to sell off land to help blunt the impacts of Trump’s spending package on the federal deficit. And in April, Wyoming’s two Republican senators voted against a Democrat-sponsored measure to block the sale of federal land to generate revenue. 
Sen. John Barrasso’s communications director, Laura Mengelkamp, did not respond to a WyoFile request Wednesday for comment on Lee’s proposal. A spokesperson for Sen. Cynthia Lummis said her office was still evaluating the proposal and did not yet have a comment. 
But last week, Lummis issued a statement, first reported by Cowboy State Daily, backing Lee’s general approach to the sale of public lands, if not the concept of the proposal the Utah senator released Wednesday.
“I support Senator Mike Lee’s efforts to address the reality that federal ownership of nearly half of all Western land — exceeding 50% in states like Wyoming, Nevada, and Utah — creates significant challenges for local communities, state governments, and efficient land management,” she said in the statement. Her office provided WyoFile a copy of the statement this week. 
“The federal government doesn’t need to perpetually own every piece of land it currently holds, and we must have honest conversations about smart, strategic land management that serves our communities while protecting our natural treasures,” Lummis said.  
Proposal angers public access groups
Lee’s proposal would require the Interior Department to sell between 0.25% and 0.5% of the total acreage of public lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, and another 0.5% to 0.75% of all lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service. According to a calculation released Wednesday night by advocacy group the National Wildlife Federation, the upper threshold of those mandates equates to more than 2.5 million acres of land passing out of public hands across the West. 
“Mandating the fire sale of up to two-and-a-half million acres of public land violates more than a century of land stewardship, threatens wildlife and clean water, runs directly against widespread public opinion, and will not begin to solve either the budget crisis or the affordable housing crisis,” David Willms, the federation’s associate vice president for public lands, said in a Wednesday night statement. 
Willms, an attorney and Wyoming resident, previously worked for former Gov. Matt Mead, a Republican. 
Lee’s proposal does not mandate the sale of certain amounts by certain states, so there is no set amount of public land that would go private in Wyoming. Conservation and public access advocates were scrambling Wednesday evening to understand which lands would be targeted by Lee’s proposal, and a more concrete picture is likely to emerge in the coming days and weeks as the U.S. Senate debates.
“This proposal is central to relieving the housing crisis, fulfilling President Trump’s housing and public lands agenda, and creating jobs and strong economic growth in the West,” a statement issued by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said. The land sale would raise between $5 billion and $10 billion in a decade.

The majority of that money would go toward helping fund the federal budget, while 5% would be spent on deferred maintenance on federal lands in the state where the lands are sold. Another 5% would go to local governments abutting sold parcels for housing development “or other associated needs,” according to the committee’s statement.  
The $10 billion the sales could raise would be a drop in the bucket compared to the overall cost of Trump’s spending bill, which largely increases the federal deficit through tax cuts that opponents say overwhelmingly benefit wealthy Americans and corporations. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated the bill will add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the same decade in which Lee would mandate the federal land sales. 
“Shoving the sale of public lands back into the budget reconciliation bill, all to fund tax cuts for the wealthy, is a betrayal of future generations and folks on both sides of the aisle,” Michael Carroll, of the The Wilderness Society, said in a statement. “We call on lawmakers who cherish public lands to reject any inclusion of public land sales in the budget reconciliation bill.” 
Though the BLM has had swathes of public lands marked for disposal, including in Wyoming, the agency follows a process that includes public participation and generally has allowed local governments to weigh in on when, how and if federal land is sold off or exchanged. That process also directs proceeds from land sales largely toward increasing public access to other federal lands. Lee’s proposal would largely sidestep the BLM’s process and is not limited to lands that have been previously marked for disposal. 
Instead, it calls for the interior secretary and secretary of agriculture, both presidential appointees, to select the lands to be sold. The proposal directs those officials to consult with state governors, tribes and local governments to select land suitable for developing housing. The language does not appear to require that development to focus on affordable housing, however, and it also calls for public lands to be sold at fair market prices. 
The federal land surrounding Jackson Hole, one community desperately in need of affordable housing, would likely be valued at steep prices.

At least 18 events are scheduled to take place in Alaska, and more than 1,500 are scheduled nationwide as part of the “No Kings” movement, which is organizing to oppose Trump actions.
Dave Musgrave is organizing an event in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, a region north of Anchorage that voted overwhelmingly for Trump last year.
“We want to raise concerns about what this administration is doing. It’s very much an authoritarian overreach,” he said by phone.
Saturday’s events were originally scheduled to counter a military march in Washington, D.C., for Trump’s 79th birthday and the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.
They’ve taken on a new tone since the president ordered the National Guard and the U.S. Marines to oppose protesters in Los Angeles.
“I think the scene is going to be a gathering of citizens concerned about what has been going on, most recently with Donald Trump sending troops to L.A.,” said Laura Stats, who has been helping organize an event in Juneau, Alaska’s capital city.
Protests were already taking place in Anchorage on Wednesday against the state’s decision to accept people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

	Forty-two people were arrested outside the state and flown here by federal officials, according to the Alaska Department of Corrections. 
The small demonstration taking place on a weekday is expected to be followed by a much larger event on Saturday, outside the Anchorage offices of Alaska’s three-person congressional delegation.
That demonstration will be followed by a march to the Anchorage Park Strip, where Juneteenth celebrations will be taking place.
Lu Dyer is communications director for Stand UP Alaska, which is helping organize the event.
“We’re protesting Donald Trump violating democratic norms and fanning the flames of fascism in this country, as well (as) on behalf of all the vulnerable folks in this state and outside of it that are falling victim to the president’s self-inflicted chaos,” they said.
In Juneau, the rally will take place near the city’s landmark whale statue. In Palmer, it will be at the intersection of the Glenn Highway and the Palmer-Wasilla Highway.
Other towns, including Kotzebue, Nome, Petersburg, Homer, Haines, Glennallen, Fairbanks, Sitka and Ketchikan, are holding their own events, with a full listing of times and locations on the “No Kings” website.
Betsy Brennan, a Nome resident, said organizers there are “trying to be a presence … and reflect the rallies going on nationwide in a peaceful manner.”
Some pro-Trump commentators have accused protesters of being paid for their participation.
“I’m just like, ‘You’ve got to be kidding me,’” said Courtney Moore, a volunteer with Stand UP Alaska, describing one false statement she heard. “No, I don’t get paid. I hate all of this for free. I’m an OG Trump hater since 2016.”
Musgrave, who plans to be in Palmer, said he expects events across the state to be peaceful.
“What you’re going to find at these rallies are granddads and grannies,” he said. “These are people that never organized before, and they’re worried about their kids and their grandkids … and said, ‘I just can’t abide this.’”
Stats, in Juneau, said she agrees with Musgrave’s description.
“We’re just regular people. We’re just regular folks who want a decent life for our children, for our grandchildren, for our neighbors, for our friends, for people who came to this country in good faith — for people who want a decent life. It feels like that’s what’s being taken away from us,” she said.
Some people who plan to participate in the weekend’s rallies said they’re worried about the possibility of violence by Trump supporters.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has called up that state’s National Guard for potential action against protesters in that state.
Jessica Bowers, a spokesperson for Gov. Mike Dunleavy, said that when it comes to Alaska, “At this time, no Alaska National Guard personnel have been activated, nor has a request for activation been made.”
Austin McDaniel, communications director for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, said that agency isn’t aware of any dangerous or illegal behavior planned as part of the weekend’s events.
“Alaskans regularly demonstrate their First Amendment rights peacefully, and we expect the protests this weekend will be no different,” he said.
In Anchorage, officers from the city’s police department will be near that city’s protest and available to help if needed, said Christopher Barraza, deputy director of community relations for APD. 
“As far as we’re currently aware, they’re all supposed to be peaceful protests, but there’s always the chance that something could happen,” he said.
Correction: The photo captions have been updated to reflect that it was the third consecutive day of protests, not the second.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Dozens of people gathered at the State House Wednesday to discuss stricter gun safety regulations that Mainers will be voting on this November. 
After a failed legislative attempt last year to implement a so-called “red flag law” — which would allow courts to temporarily take guns away from people perceived as a threat by law enforcement or their family members — a citizen-led initiative collected more than 80,000 signatures to put a referendum question on the ballot for this year. 
But before the question goes to voters in November, the Legislature is required to hold a public hearing for the referendum: LD 1378. Wednesday’s meeting came after Republicans repeatedly questioned why a public hearing was never scheduled for the proposal.
After pleas from Republicans, last-minute hearing scheduled for red flag initiative

Red flag laws, formally known as extreme risk protection orders, are active in twenty-one states, including four states in New England. Maine is the only state with a yellow flag law. 
The referendum proposes allowing a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to file a petition, along with an affidavit of facts, for an extreme risk protection order if someone is suspected of posing a significant danger of causing physical injury to themself or another person. That protection order would prohibit the person from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.” 
A court would be required to schedule a hearing within 14 days of when the petition is filed. If the court finds the individual does pose a significant risk of causing physical injury, the court must issue an order prohibiting them from purchasing, possessing or receiving a dangerous weapon for up to one year. The person would need to immediately surrender any dangerous weapons in their possession to law enforcement.
A person could request to have the order terminated if they can show evidence that they no longer pose a risk of physical harm. Conversely, an order can also be renewed for up to one additional year.
At the hearing, about 30 speakers highlighted flaws in Maine’s current “yellow flag law,” which allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. Family members of people who died in the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston as well as doctors, psychiatrists and school teachers all pointed to issues with the yellow flag law, arguing that stricter regulations could have helped prevent the shooting.

“I get regular calls from people who are desperate for help when a loved one or others are in crisis, who are dangerous and harmful firearms that are not getting help from the police. I have to explain to them that there’s nothing that I can do as an individual on this kind of advocacy,” said Nacole Palmer, executive director of the Maine Gun Safety Coalition, which collected signatures for the citizen initiative. 
“But there’s something that we can all do together this November by passing this proven, life-saving law that empowers family members and will help keep our schools and communities safe,” she added.
Mental health professionals and doctors from several national organizations said the current law’s required mental health evaluation weakens it. 
“Ultimately, family members know their loved ones best. They are first to notice when something is wrong and when someone they love is wrong,” said Madeleine DesFosses, speaking on behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Maine Medical Association. “We need to ensure that an efficient process is available, and that makes it easier to get dangerous weapons away from someone.”
Critics of the bill included members of law enforcement, who said the yellow flag law is working well and that allowing courts to directly take away weapons makes enforcement of the red flag law more dangerous for law enforcement officers who have to confiscate them. Some opponents also argued that it’s unconstitutional and lacks due process. 
If the referendum passes, it would not replace Maine’s current law, but would be an additional tool police or the general public can use to temporarily confiscate weapons. But Lt. Michael Johnston of the Maine State Police argued that having two different avenues is unnecessary, since the current system is working well, as evidenced by the increase in frequency of use. 
Maine medical community backs proposed red flag law

“I think this is going to be a heightened risk of service for law enforcement and for the respondent,” Johnston said, testifying in opposition to the referendum. “You get diminished returns if you have similar processes in place, people aren’t sure which ones to take advantage of.”
Yellow flag law use
The public hearing included lengthy discussion on the effectiveness and barriers of the current law. Since the Lewiston shooting, the use of the yellow flag law has skyrocketed. Law enforcement used it more times in the first two months of this year than the first three years after its passing in 2020. So far, there have been 881 total applications, 800 of which were after the October 2023 shooting, according to Maine State Police. Johnston said he is only aware of two times that state police were unsuccessful in temporarily confiscating weapons under the yellow flag law rules.
But that use remains high because the yellow flag law “failed so spectacularly that 18 Mainers were slaughtered,” Palmer said. “And the people of Maine, including our law enforcement, are so desperate to make sure that kind of thing doesn’t happen again.”
Johnston said “Lewiston was a wake up call for everyone,” and that law enforcement is already focused on better training and implementation of the yellow flag law. Adding another tool that doesn’t work as well to the tool chest, he said, “can detract or diminish from what’s already working.”
Failed legislative attempt to pass red flag law 
Similar legislation was introduced last session, but it died without a vote in the full Senate or House of Representatives. 
That bill was sponsored by Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland), who at the time was speaker of the House. A lengthy budget debate on the last day of the session upended plans for the chambers to take it up.
At the time, the measure was particularly popular among Maine’s medical community which praised the proposal for its efforts to address the public health crisis of gun violence without stigmatizing mental illness.
Like last year’s proposal, the red flag bill heard Wednesday is up against the legislative clock. Though lawmakers are no longer beholden to the statutory adjournment date of June 18, given that they are technically in a special session, leaders have indicated they intend to stick with that deadline.

Kim Reynolds Wednesday vetoed a controversial bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa.
House Republican leaders initiated an effort to reconvene the Legislature to override the veto, but Senate GOP leaders indicated that was unlikely.
House File 639 would have increased insurance requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines, limited carbon pipeline permits to one 25-year term and changed the definition of a common carrier for pipelines, making it more difficult for the projects to use eminent domain.
Reynolds, in a statement, said she shared the bill’s goal of “protecting landowners” but the bill lacked the “clear, careful lines” drawn in good policy.
“It combines valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets,” Reynolds said in a letter announcing her decision to veto.
Reynolds followed her critique of the bill by noting that Iowa could lose its “leadership position” as a top biofuel production state if legislation stopped the infrastructure necessary to enter ultra-low carbon markets.
Central to the bill is a carbon sequestration pipeline project led by Summit Carbon Solutions that would transport liquid carbon dioxide, captured from biorefineries across Iowa, to underground storage in North Dakota.
Reynolds said the bill would stop Iowa from leading in biofuels
Farmers and the biofuels industry have been supportive of the Summit pipeline, and therefore opposed to the bill, because it would give Iowa access to the carbon capture and sequestration technologies necessary to make products like sustainable aviation fuels.
In a statement following the governor’s veto, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said without carbon capture projects, and entry to ultra-low carbon fuel industry, Iowa could face “very real, very severe economic consequences.”
“This is a classic example of why our system of government has checks and balances,” Shaw said. “Any thoughtful review of this bill would determine that it would lead to higher energy prices for Iowans, hamper future economic development, hold back job creation, and stifle new markets for Iowa farmers. IRFA thanks Gov. Reynolds for listening to Iowans, studying the actual legislation, and ignoring the rhetoric that was as inaccurate as it was loud.”
A press release from Iowa Corn Growers Association said entrance to the aviation fuel industry alone could result in nearly 6.5 million bushels of new corn demand, which it said is necessary for farmers dealing with high input costs and decreased profit margins.
Farmers “need expanded market growth and access to continue raising corn profitably; allowing them to continue growing Iowa’s agricultural industry and economy,” the statement said.
Opponents of the bill, including several lawmakers, argued the bill was aimed solely at carbon sequestration projects, rather than protecting landowners from eminent domain as supporters claimed.
“Eminent domain” allows the government to force private landowners to allow use of their property, for a fee set by the courts, for infrastructure projects deemed in the public interest. Eminent domain has long been used projects such as public roads and utilities.
Leadership from Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, said its CO2 pipeline project connecting to Nebraska’s Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline would be impacted by the bill’s insurance and permit limit clauses, even though the SIRE project secured voluntary easements for 100% of its path in Iowa.
Reynolds cited this example in her explanation, and said the “arbitrary” term limits and insurance requirements would make it “difficult for companies like SIRE to justify the additional investment” in Iowa.
“Those who crafted the bill said they don’t want to stop CO2 pipelines that rely entirely on voluntary easements,” Reynolds said. “But that is exactly what the bill does.”
Summit Carbon Solutions thanked the governor for her “thoughtful and thorough review” of the bill. In a statement, the company said the pipeline project “opens the door to new markets and helps strengthen America’s energy dominance for the long term.”
“Summit remains committed to working with landowners through voluntary agreements—just as we have with more than 1,300 Iowa landowners to date, resulting in $175 million in payments,” a spokesperson said in the statement. “We look forward to continued discussions with state leaders as we advance this important project.”
Reynolds said more needs to be done to limit the use of eminent domain
Opponents to the pipeline project, who were supportive of HF 639, argue the pipeline would negatively impact their properties and health, and that sequestering CO2 does not constitute a “public use” deserving of eminent domain rights.
Landowners opposed to the project lobbied state lawmakers for four years before a bill was debated, and ultimately passed, in the Senate and sent to the governor.
Since the bill landed on the governor’s desk, landowners have encouraged Reynolds to support Iowa GOP values on protecting property rights.
Reynolds said the debate of when the government, or companies with government approval, can take private property is a “debate as old as the Republic.”
“I’ve consistently said that if eminent domain is used, it must be rare, fair and a last resort,” Reynolds said. “But HF 639 isn’t just about eminent domain.”
Reynolds said the bill sets a precedent that “threatens” the state’s “energy reliability, economy and reputation as a place where businesses can invest with confidence.”
Mary Powell, a Shelby County landowner opposed to the pipeline, said the veto shows that the state motto of, “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain” are “just empty words” to the governor.
“Governor Reynolds chose to support the millionaires and billionaires at the expense of Iowans and their property rights,” Powell said in a statement.
Another landowner, Don Johanssen from Cherokee County, said the governor’s decision was “beyond words,” especially as the bill would have given landowners “some liability coverage” from hazardous pipelines.
The bill would have required pipeline operator to carry insurance that covered any loss or injury from accidental, negligent or intentional discharges from the pipeline, and to cover insurance increases that landowners face due to the pipeline.
“This is a sad day for Iowa that will be long remembered,” Johanssen said.
Reynolds said the bill would impact “more than just CO2 infrastructure” and would change permitting rules “across the board,” giving “uncertainty into critical energy projects.”
Opponents of the bill called the insurance requirements “untenable.”
The American Petroleum Institute’s Midwest Regional Director Mike Karbo said the bill had “unprecedented and unfeasible requirements” that would have hindered future projects in the state.
“Since there are no refineries in the state, critical energy infrastructure, such as pipelines, are crucial in ensuring Iowans have a reliable source of energy, and certainty is needed to develop the infrastructure network,” Karbo said. “We thank the Governor for doing what is right for the future of energy development in the state.”
Reynolds said HF 639 included “a few helpful provisions” and the surrounding debate “highlighted” areas for progress.
“I agree we can do more to limit the use of eminent domain, promote transparency, and ensure responsible land restoration,” Reynolds said. “We can do better.”
Reynolds, who is not running for reelection in 2026, said she is “committed” to working with legislation to “strengthen landowner protections, modernize permitting and respect private property.”
Taking one element from HF 639, Reynolds will ask the IUC to require all commissioners to be present for live testimony and ensure at least one commissioner is present at every informational meeting.
House Speaker Pat Grassley starts petition to reconvene, override veto
In a statement from Iowa House Republicans, Speaker Pat Grassley said he has requested members sign a petition to reconvene the Legislature in a special session.
“This veto is a major setback for Iowa,” Grassley said in the statement. “It is a setback not only for landowners who have been fighting across Iowa, but for the work the House of Representatives has put in for four years to get legislation like HF 639 passed. We will not stop fighting and stand firm on our commitment until landowners’ in Iowa are protected against Eminent Domain for private gain.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said he was “very disappointed” in the governor’s decision and that he was supportive of a special session to override the veto.
Two-thirds of the Legislature must sign a petition to request a special session, and to override a veto, two-thirds of the members from each chamber must vote to pass the bill again.
Sen. Jack Whitver, R-Grimes, the majority leader for the chamber, said he expects most of his caucus will “not be interested in any attempt” to override the governor’s veto.
The bill likely would not have advanced in the Senate had it not been for a dozen Republican senators who vowed to block necessary budget legislation until the chamber debated eminent domain. The 12 were also joined by Senate Democrats in pushing for amendments, which were ultimately defeated, and approval of the bill.
Senate Democrats said the fight for property rights will continue.
“I’m disappointed by the governor’s veto of HF639, but, unfortunately, I cannot say I’m surprised,” Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, said. “There is simply no amount of political posturing or legislative stonewalling that can deny the fact that Iowans’ right to private property should never be infringed upon for private gain.”
One of the 12 to disagree with the Senate majority, Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, said signing the bill was “the single option available” to protect the rights of impacted landowners. Alons pledged to “never quit working” on the issue, but said that means “very little” to landowners who have been impacted by the “unprecedented, and unconstitutional land grab.”
“To be clear: the Iowa government has given this private company the right to take people’s land for one reason: corporate earnings,” Alons said in a statement. “This has nothing to do with public use. It’s absolutely not necessary for the ethanol industry in our state … And it certainly is not what the founders had in mind.”
Alons said when the Legislature returns in January, he and other lawmakers “will use every tool at our disposal” to “return property rights back to the people.”
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, who sponsored the legislation, wrote in a social media post he was “profoundly disappointed” by the veto. Holt said the state constitution and the Republican platform are clear in their message that eminent domain is for public use projects.
“Today the Governor has chosen to ignore landowners, the vast majority of the Legislature, the Republican Party Platform and the Iowa Constitution by choosing the economic development argument of special interests,” Holt wrote.
Holt said Reynolds, and the Senate had opportunities of the past several years to offer their own suggestions to the eminent domain issue instead of opposing House legislation.
“On behalf of the people of Iowa and their fundamental property rights, the Governor’s veto should be overridden,” he wrote. “This fight for who we are as Republicans is far from over.”
House Democratic Leader Rep. Brian Meyer said parties in the House collaborated to “protect property rights.”
“At the end of the day, there is only one group to blame for the failure of the eminent domain bill: Iowa Republican lawmakers,” Meyer said in a statement.
The first phase of the Summit Carbon Solutions project was approved by IUC nearly a year ago, which granted Summit the right to condemn easements from landowners who do not want to voluntarily sign agreements to put the pipeline on their land. Per the Iowa permit, Summit still needs a permit from South Dakota, which it has been denied twice, to begin construction.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Day Three of the federal lawsuit alleging that a Tampa Bay area state Senate district was racially gerrymandered focused in part on how that district was created in 2022.
The suit, filed by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University on behalf of three residents of Tampa and St. Petersburg, alleges the Legislature packed Black voters into District 16 to reduce their influence in nearby District 18, in violation of their equal-protection rights.
Democrat Darryl Rouson serves in SD 16, while Republican Nick DiCeglie is the incumbent in SD 18.
The defendants are Senate President Ben Albritton and Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd, and their attorneys began their defense on Wednesday, bringing Jay Ferrin back to the witness stand in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa.
Ferrin is now a senior adviser to the Florida Senate, but he served as staff director of the Florida Senate Committee on Reapportionment in the fall of 2021, when the districts lines were created. He discussed how he and his staff went about drawing up the Senate districts that year and the guidelines they followed.
The reapportionment process beginning that fall was taking place under the guidance of  Ray Rodrigues, who chaired the Senate Reapportionment Committee.
Defense attorneys aired several Florida Channel video excerpts on Wednesday showing Rodrigues explaining how “hard lessons were learned” following the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in 2015 to throw out the GOP-controlled Legislature’s maps after deeming them unlawful under the Fair Districts constitutional amendments adopted by voters in 2010.
Rodrigues was insistent that he wanted the 2022 Legislature to conduct itself in such a fashion that the courts would not reject the maps lawmakers  would produce.
“This map will withstand a court challenge,” Rodrigues declared on the floor of the Senate.
That’s what the trial taking place this week will ultimately determine.

Ferrin testified that, after his staff created other Senate districts in the Tampa Bay area, there remained about 100,000 residents in Pinellas County who would have to be inserted into another Senate district.
(With the population of Florida in 2021 at 21.5 million people, Ferrin said, his staff were tasked to draw approximately 538,438 voters into each of the 40 Senate districts).
The resultant SD 16, which encompasses parts of St. Petersburg and Hillsborough County, is similar to the “benchmark” map created in 2015 that was then known as Senate District 19. Ferrin denied that he was instructed to maintain that same configuration.
He also said that under the rules promulgated by Rodrigues, he and his fellow staffers could speak about any new maps only with either the Senate’s general counsel or other Senate members — and not the general public. He was not supposed to review public submissions.
Florida senators were allowed to propose amendments during the reapportionment process, to add their own maps. Rodrigues and Democratic Sen. Audrey Gibson had filed such amendments, Ferrin said, but no senator had asked him to directly to create any Senate maps.
ACLU attorney Nicholas Warren said at the beginning of the morning that he had sought to depose Rodrigues and fellow Republican and committee member Danny Burgess before the trial, but both had asserted legislative privilege, which shields them having to testify in certain lawsuits.
Expert witnesses
In the afternoon, the defense called two expert witnesses who criticized the expert witness testimony and voting analysis that came from the plaintiffs on Tuesday.
Steven Voss is a political science professor at the University of Kentucky. When asked to break down the political partisanship of the Tampa Bay area, he included four counties that make up the Tampa Bay metropolitan statistical area — Hillsborough, Pinellas, Polk and Hernando.
Based on population, he said, five Senate districts could be folded into the area, and that three historically were reliably Republican while two would favor Democrats. Currently, that breakdown is four Republican districts and one Democratic — with Senate District 14, which Voss said historically favored Democrats, going to the GOP in 2022.
Voss took aim at the alternative voting maps produced for the ACLU by Penn State University professor of statistics Cory McCartan. Those maps showed that a district could have been fairly drawn up exclusively in Hillsborough County while still protecting Tier-1 standards there and in Pinellas County.
(That involves the Florida Constitution’s Fair District Amendment, which says that districts shall not be drawn with the intent or result of denying or abridging the equal opportunity of racial or language minorities to participate in the political process or diminish their ability to elect representatives of their choice).
Voss said that the result of McCartan’s work was that he was “cracking and packing” voters in his maps to ultimately help Democrats at the voting booth.
Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics, also testified for the defense. He praised the composition of the Senate maps passed by the Legislature in 2022, saying it was “pretty incompetent racial gerrymandering, if that’s what’s going on.”
The trial is expected to conclude on Thursday.

The seven-judge panel ruled unanimously in favor of the intellectually disabled 10th grader and her parents. The decision clarified that a school district may be held liable for negligence leading to a student’s sexual assault by a third party and its responsibility is not limited to abuse by school employees. 
Lawyers for the girl, who is identified only by the initials L.F.M. in court documents, and an education advocate said the decision significantly improves protection for students.
“Today is a better day for children,” said Nadeem Bezar of Kline & Specter, who brought the lawsuit on behalf of the girl and her parents with co-counsel Helen Lawless. “We are happy that the Commonwealth Court interpreted the statute the way the legislature intended. We understand the case still has a ways to go. But today is a step in the right direction.”
Spokesperson Monique Braxton said the School District of Philadelphia is reviewing the decision and anticipates seeking review by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 
“The district values the safety of our students and staff. If a student sees something that they feel is concerning, we encourage them to share their concerns with their parents, teachers, and other district staff,” Braxton said in a statement. “We all play a role in keeping our schools and communities safe, and encourage students, staff, and families to say something if they see something.”
According to the lawsuit, L.F.M. was enrolled in a co-ed gym class at South Philadelphia High School with other students with disabilities and learning impairments. In October 2021, two classmates pushed her behind the bleachers, sexually assaulted her and demanded that she go into a bathroom to take and share sexually explicit images.
One of the students continued to harass and demand explicit images from L.F.M. by telephone that evening, when the girl’s mother overheard. The girl told her mother what had happened in school and the mother reported the assault to the district and police, the suit says. 
The lawsuit alleges the school district failed to ensure that its employees properly supervised students in the gym class, permitting the girl’s attackers to carry out the assault. It claims the district is liable for negligently permitting the assault.
The Commonwealth Court decision centers on a relatively new addition to the state law that limits tort liability for public agencies in Pennsylvania. The Political Subdivision and Torts Claims Act (PSTCA) grants immunity to government entities except under a handful of scenarios and limits damages to $500,000.
As part of a legislative package to secure justice for victims of childhood abuse, former state Rep. Mark Rozzi (D-Berks) won approval of the sexual assault exception. Signed into law by Gov. Tom Wolf in 2019, it allows individuals to sue public schools if they are victims of acts that would constitute criminal sexual assault under state law.
In response to L.F.M.’s lawsuit, the Philadelphia School District argued the exception applies only to acts by the district and employees. A Philadelphia judge rejected the district’s argument and it appealed in Commonwealth Court. The student’s lawyers argued the exception permits claims for sexual abuse by a third-party, such as other students, if it results from negligent actions or omissions by the school district.
In an opinion by Judge Lori Dumas, the court found the purpose of the exception was to hold public entities accountable for enabling abusers and to expand the rights of victims to sue. 
Dumas cited Rozzi’s statement in a “friend-of-the-court brief” that the purpose was not to hold institutions accountable for employing abusers but for enabling abusers to carry out their crimes against children.
The district claimed the primary purpose of the PSTCA is to protect taxpayers and that broadly interpreting the exception could impede the district’s financial ability to serve its 200,000 students.
“We must presume the legislature also recognized its duty of protecting the public fisc, including the potential monetary harm to municipalities from large tort recoveries,” Dumas wrote. “Upon balancing those duties, the legislature nevertheless enacted an exception to governmental immunity, removed the damages cap, and extended the statute of limitations. We cannot reweigh those considerations.”
Maura McInerney, legal director at the Education Law Center, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization dedicated to ensuring access to education, said the decision makes clear that public schools have an obligation to protect children so that incidents such as the one in the lawsuit cannot happen.
“I think the case should send a powerful message to school districts,” McInerney said, adding that the plaintiffs in the case still have to show that the district’s actions or omissions have a causal relationship to the assault.
Rozzi, who was raped by a priest as a child, drew on his experience as a sexual abuse survivor to champion victims’ rights in the General Assembly. In addition to the PSTCA exception, he succeeded in passing laws to extend the statute of limitations for survivors to pursue civil claims against abusers and enablers until age 55. He also won approval of a law to eliminate the criminal statute of limitations for sexual offenses.
Before he retired after six terms in the state House last year, Rozzi had also pursued a state constitutional amendment to provide a two-year window for survivors to pursue civil sexual abuse claims, regardless of their age. Although the legislation failed, it was reintroduced this session and passed in the House again Monday. The bill will now be considered in the Senate. 
Rozzi said the Commonwealth Court ruling would help school districts “analyze their policies to protect children thoroughly and extensively.”
“It is a matter of life and death, and they are in your hands when they’re here in your school,” Rozzi said, adding that a moment of inattention by a school employee could be tragic. “In that 10 or 15 minutes, that’s all it takes for a child to be raped.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-28-at-4.03.40-PM-1024x546.png,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

“Gipson for Governor!” he posted on social media. “Mississippi knows Andy Gipson won’t back down from our conservative principles, because when it comes to getting things done, Andy Gipson is Mississippi’s proven conservative leader.”
Republican Gipson, 48, is a former state lawmaker, a lawyer, Baptist minister and, coming in July with the release of his first album, “Songs of Faith,” recording artist. He served 10 years in the Mississippi state House District 77 seat representing Simpson and Rankin counties. He has served as commissioner of agriculture and commerce since 2018, and since then has been known for his ever-present cowboy hat.
As chairman of the Judiciary B Committee in the state House, Gipson was known for shepherding numerous gun-rights bills through the Legislature, making Mississippi one of the most permissive states for owning and carrying a gun and earning him recognition and awards from the National Rifle Association and other groups.
“Whether leading the charge for Life in protecting the unborn, in standing for our Second Amendment rights, or in defending our freedoms against Joe Biden’s oppressive federal mandates, Andy Gipson was always there in the fight,” Gipson wrote Wednesday evening. “He’s always been in the fight with President Donald J. Trump, and he’s still in the fight for the Future of Mississippi.”

Gipson is an early avowed entrant into what could become a crowded Republican primary for governor in 2027, with current Gov. Tate Reeves term limited in his second and final term. Jockeying and fundraising for Mississippi’s 2027 statewide elections is entering full swing, with politicians eyeing open seats for governor, lieutenant governor and potentially others through a domino effect.
Besides Gipson, other Republicans considering a run for governor in bright-red Mississippi include Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, State Auditor Shad White, Attorney General Lynn Fitch, former U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, former House Speaker Philip Gunn and billionaire businessman Tommy Duff.
Gipson in his post wrote: “Born, raised and educated 100 percent right here in Mississippi, Andy Gipson loves our Magnolia State. He’s visited all 82 counties and has traveled the United States — and the World — to promote our beloved State and our People … As we look to the future there’s no doubt Andy Gipson is Mississippi’s Proven Conservative Leader, and Mississippi’s best choice for Governor in 2027.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/05020121/3X0A6855-scaled.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Kim Reynolds Wednesday vetoed a controversial bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa.
House Republican leaders initiated an effort to reconvene the Legislature to override the veto, but Senate GOP leaders indicated that was unlikely.
House File 639 would have increased insurance requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines, limited carbon pipeline permits to one 25-year term and changed the definition of a common carrier for pipelines, making it more difficult for the projects to use eminent domain. 
Reynolds, in a statement, said she shared the bill’s goal of “protecting landowners” but the bill lacked the “clear, careful lines” drawn in good policy. 
“It combines valid concerns with vague legal standards and sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets,” Reynolds said in a letter announcing her decision to veto. 
Reynolds followed her critique of the bill by noting that Iowa could lose its “leadership position” as a top biofuel production state if legislation stopped the infrastructure necessary to enter ultra-low carbon markets. 
Central to the bill is a carbon sequestration pipeline project led by Summit Carbon Solutions that would transport liquid carbon dioxide, captured from biorefineries across Iowa, to underground storage in North Dakota.
Reynolds said the bill would stop Iowa from leading in biofuels
Farmers and the biofuels industry have been supportive of the Summit pipeline, and therefore opposed to the bill, because it would give Iowa access to the carbon capture and sequestration technologies necessary to make products like sustainable aviation fuels. 
In a statement following the governor’s veto, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said without carbon capture projects, and entry to ultra-low carbon fuel industry, Iowa could face “very real, very severe economic consequences.” 
“This is a classic example of why our system of government has checks and balances,” Shaw said. “Any thoughtful review of this bill would determine that it would lead to higher energy prices for Iowans, hamper future economic development, hold back job creation, and stifle new markets for Iowa farmers. IRFA thanks Gov. Reynolds for listening to Iowans, studying the actual legislation, and ignoring the rhetoric that was as inaccurate as it was loud.”

A press release from Iowa Corn Growers Association said entrance to the aviation fuel industry alone could result in nearly 6.5 billion bushels of new corn demand, which it said is necessary for farmers dealing with high input costs and decreased profit margins. 
Farmers “need expanded market growth and access to continue raising corn profitably; allowing them to continue growing Iowa’s agricultural industry and economy,” the statement said. 
Opponents of the bill, including several lawmakers, argued the bill was aimed solely at carbon sequestration projects, rather than protecting landowners from eminent domain as supporters claimed.
“Eminent domain” allows the government to force private landowners to allow use of their property, for a fee set by the courts, for infrastructure projects deemed in the public interest. Eminent domain has long been used projects such as public roads and utilities.
Leadership from Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, said its CO2 pipeline project connecting to Nebraska’s Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline would be impacted by the bill’s insurance and permit limit clauses, even though the SIRE project secured voluntary easements for 100% of its path in Iowa.
Reynolds cited this example in her explanation, and said the “arbitrary” term limits and insurance requirements would make it “difficult for companies like SIRE to justify the additional investment” in Iowa.  
“Those who crafted the bill said they don’t want to stop CO2 pipelines that rely entirely on voluntary easements,” Reynolds said. “But that is exactly what the bill does.” 
Summit Carbon Solutions thanked the governor for her “thoughtful and thorough review” of the bill. In a statement, the company said the pipeline project “opens the door to new markets and helps strengthen America’s energy dominance for the long term.”
“Summit remains committed to working with landowners through voluntary agreements—just as we have with more than 1,300 Iowa landowners to date, resulting in $175 million in payments,” a spokesperson said in the statement. “We look forward to continued discussions with state leaders as we advance this important project.”
Reynolds said more needs to be done to limit the use of eminent domain
Opponents to the pipeline project, who were supportive of HF 639, argue the pipeline would negatively impact their properties and health, and that sequestering CO2 does not constitute a “public use” deserving of eminent domain rights. 
Landowners opposed to the project lobbied state lawmakers for four years before a bill was debated, and ultimately passed, in the Senate and sent to the governor. 
Since the bill landed on the governor’s desk, landowners have encouraged Reynolds to support Iowa GOP values on protecting property rights. 
Reynolds said the debate of when the government, or companies with government approval, can take private property is a “debate as old as the Republic.”

“I’ve consistently said that if eminent domain is used, it must be rare, fair and a last resort,” Reynolds said. “But HF 639 isn’t just about eminent domain.”
Reynolds said the bill sets a precedent that “threatens” the state’s “energy reliability, economy and reputation as a place where businesses can invest with confidence.”
Mary Powell, a Shelby County landowner opposed to the pipeline, said the veto shows that the state motto of, “Our liberties we prize, and our rights we will maintain” are “just empty words” to the governor.
“Governor Reynolds chose to support the millionaires and billionaires at the expense of Iowans and their property rights,” Powell said in a statement. 
Another landowner, Don Johanssen from Cherokee County, said the governor’s decision was “beyond words,” especially as the bill would have given landowners “some liability coverage” from hazardous pipelines. 
The bill would have required pipeline operator to carry insurance that covered any loss or injury from accidental, negligent or intentional discharges from the pipeline, and to cover insurance increases that landowners face due to the pipeline.
“This is a sad day for Iowa that will be long remembered,” Johanssen said. 
Reynolds said the bill would impact “more than just CO2 infrastructure” and would change permitting rules “across the board,” giving “uncertainty into critical energy projects.” 
Opponents of the bill called the insurance requirements “untenable.”
The American Petroleum Institute’s Midwest Regional Director Mike Karbo said the bill had “unprecedented and unfeasible requirements” that would have hindered future projects in the state.
“Since there are no refineries in the state, critical energy infrastructure, such as pipelines, are crucial in ensuring Iowans have a reliable source of energy, and certainty is needed to develop the infrastructure network,” Karbo said. “We thank the Governor for doing what is right for the future of energy development in the state.” 
Reynolds said HF 639 included “a few helpful provisions” and the surrounding debate “highlighted” areas for progress. 
“I agree we can do more to limit the use of eminent domain, promote transparency, and ensure responsible land restoration,” Reynolds said. “We can do better.” 
Reynolds, who is not running for reelection in 2026, said she is “committed” to working with legislation to “strengthen landowner protections, modernize permitting and respect private property.”
Taking one element from HF 639, Reynolds will ask the IUC to require all commissioners to be present for live testimony and ensure at least one commissioner is present at every informational meeting. 
House Speaker Pat Grassley starts petition to reconvene, override veto
In a statement from Iowa House Republicans, Speaker Pat Grassley said he has requested members sign a petition to reconvene the Legislature in a special session. 
“This veto is a major setback for Iowa,” Grassley said in the statement. “It is a setback not only for landowners who have been fighting across Iowa, but for the work the House of Representatives has put in for four years to get legislation like HF 639 passed. We will not stop fighting and stand firm on our commitment until landowners’ in Iowa are protected against Eminent Domain for private gain.”
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, said he was “very disappointed” in the governor’s decision and that he was supportive of a special session to override the veto. 
Two-thirds of the Legislature must sign a petition to request a special session, and to override a veto, two-thirds of the members from each chamber must vote to pass the bill again.
Sen. Jack Whitver, R-Grimes, the majority leader for the chamber, said he expects most of his caucus will “not be interested in any attempt” to override the governor’s veto. 
The bill likely would not have advanced in the Senate had it not been for a dozen Republican senators who vowed to block necessary budget legislation until the chamber debated eminent domain. The 12 were also joined by Senate Democrats in pushing for amendments, which were ultimately defeated, and approval of the bill.

Senate Democrats said the fight for property rights will continue.
“I’m disappointed by the governor’s veto of HF639, but, unfortunately, I cannot say I’m surprised,” Sen. Janice Weiner, D-Iowa City, said. “There is simply no amount of political posturing or legislative stonewalling that can deny the fact that Iowans’ right to private property should never be infringed upon for private gain.” 
One of the 12 to disagree with the Senate majority, Sen. Kevin Alons, R-Salix, said signing the bill was “the single option available” to protect the rights of impacted landowners. Alons pledged to “never quit working” on the issue, but said that means “very little” to landowners who have been impacted by the “unprecedented, and unconstitutional land grab.” 
“To be clear: the Iowa government has given this private company the right to take people’s land for one reason: corporate earnings,” Alons said in a statement. “This has nothing to do with public use. It’s absolutely not necessary for the ethanol industry in our state … And it certainly is not what the founders had in mind.”
Alons said when the Legislature returns in January, he and other lawmakers “will use every tool at our disposal” to “return property rights back to the people.”
Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, who sponsored the legislation, wrote in a social media post he was “profoundly disappointed” by the veto. Holt said the state constitution and the Republican platform are clear in their message that eminent domain is for public use projects. 
“Today the Governor has chosen to ignore landowners, the vast majority of the Legislature, the Republican Party Platform and the Iowa Constitution by choosing the economic development argument of special interests,” Holt wrote. 
Holt said Reynolds, and the Senate had opportunities of the past several years to offer their own suggestions to the eminent domain issue instead of opposing House legislation. 
“On behalf of the people of Iowa and their fundamental property rights, the Governor’s veto should be overridden,” he wrote. “This fight for who we are as Republicans is far from over.” 
House Democratic Leader Rep. Brian Meyer said parties in the House collaborated to “protect property rights.” 
“At the end of the day, there is only one group to blame for the failure of the eminent domain bill: Iowa Republican lawmakers,” Meyer said in a statement. 
The first phase of the Summit Carbon Solutions project was approved by IUC nearly a year ago, which granted Summit the right to condemn easements from landowners who do not want to voluntarily sign agreements to put the pipeline on their land. Per the Iowa permit, Summit still needs a permit from South Dakota, which it has been denied twice, to begin construction.

Sarah Lightner (R-Springport) told a state legislative committee Wednesday. 
She’s proposing a package of bills to provide prosecutors more time and avenues to preserve penalties for murder they deem appropriate. 
People are already being resentenced in Michigan for murders they committed as 19 or 20 year-olds after a decision by the Michigan Supreme Court in April found mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole for first degree murder is “unconstitutionally cruel punishment” for 19- and 20-year-olds. The state’s highest court made the same determination for 18-year-old offenders in 2022.
This hits close to home for Lightner, who shared with the state House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that she attended a resentencing hearing last year for a person who at 18 years old beat her friend’s grandmother and caretaker to death in the grandmother’s home, leaving them unrecognizable. 
“This gentleman was let out,” Lightner said. “He should have never been let out of prison.”
Though the state Supreme Court’s decisions still allow young offenders to receive life sentences without parole, it will be rarer as without the mandatory status, prosecutors face the burden to show a court that life in prison without parole is proportionate to the crime.
A key change Lightner is seeking in her bill package, House Bills 4506, 4507 and 4508, is if a court decides to not to sentence someone with an eligible crime fitting life imprisonment without parole, they must be given a minimum of 35 years in prison and any additional charges they were convicted on during the crime must be served consecutively, not concurrently. In the case of murders with multiple victims, this proposed rule would stack charges for effectively life sentences.
Lightner’s bills would also expand the 90-day time window after the Supreme Court’s April decision for prosecutors to file for the previous sentences to be upheld from 90 days to 360 days.
Prosecutors are rushing to address more than 600 of the “worst of the worst” cases involving killings where perpetrators sexually assaulted or dismembered victims, sometimes in their own homes, said Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeffrey Getting. Families were given the small peace of mind to be assured their loved one’s killer would not be eligible for parole, only to now have that solace ripped from them, he added.
“They left my office knowing that the defendant was going to be incarcerated for the rest of his life and now I am calling them. I am sending them letters. I am sitting down in my office with them and telling them ‘I know you were told that by a judge, I know you were told that by a former prosecutor, I know you were told that by me’, and having to say, ‘nope that’s not true’…these cases are incredibly hard,” Getting said.
Whereas the Michigan Supreme Court’s decision goes in depth to speak about the lack of critical thinking young people possess and their vast capacity for rehabilitation, Getting pointed out that victims and the impact of their murders on their family was barely mentioned, with the word “victim” only appearing a handful of times in the decision.
“I don’t like having conversations with families and saying, ‘Well, yeah, it doesn’t matter that both of your children were killed, that both of your parents were killed, that an entire family was killed’, those are the conversations I’m having. ‘Nope, that victim doesn’t count’,” Getting said.
Though there is no question that the offenses at issue require serious response from the legal system, Maya Menlo, representing Criminal Defense attorneys of Michigan, or CDAM,  and the Michigan State Appellate Defender Office, or SADO, said. However, both the U.S. Constitution and the Michigan Constitution require courts to engage in individualized sentencing proceedings taking into consideration the element of youth.
Some of the measures in the bill, including the alternative 35-year minimum being proposed in Lightner’s bills could lead to “prolonged and likely successful litigation” due to their constitutional violations.
“Litigation will, of course, create delay. Delay in resentencing is not good for victims. It’s not good for people who SATO and CDAM represents, and it’s not good for courts or the public. Delay will result in keeping older, rehabilitated people in prison who do not need to be there. Generally, elderly people are, of course, the most expensive people to incarcerate, and so that is a cost that will be coming out of our taxpayers pockets,” Menlo said.

Environmental Protection Agency says coal plant greenhouse gas emissions ""do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.""
The post Trump to axe power plant emission rules, a potential boon for Wyoming coal appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration announced Wednesday plans to repeal “all ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions standards for the power sector,” as well as Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxins Standards “that directly result in coal-fired power plants having to shut down,” the federal agency said.
“These Biden-era regulations have imposed massive costs on coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants, raising the cost of living for American families, imperiling the reliability of our electric grid and limiting American energy prosperity,” the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said in a press release Wednesday afternoon.
Wyoming politicians and coal proponents cheered the news.

“Today, I welcome the proposed repeal by the EPA of the so-called Clean Power Plan Version 2 that [EPA] Administrator Lee Zeldin and I have discussed over the past several months, and I encourage him to proceed with it with all due urgency,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a prepared statement. “The lopsided and misguided policies of the Biden administration have already wreaked enough havoc on our nation’s power supply and delayed our progress providing the beautiful clean coal President Donald Trump recognizes as essential to having a reliable, affordable and dispatchable energy supply for our nation.”
Wyoming is the nation’s largest coal producer, and more than 90% of the commodity is shipped to coal-burning electric generating plants in the U.S. The state’s coal mining industry has declined precipitously since 2008, while many communities that rely on mining — as well as coal power plants — have struggled to chart an economic future.
Electric utilities have cited federal regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions, as well as emissions of toxic metals, for retiring coal power plants. But they’ve also pointed to cheap natural gas as an alternative at the same facilities and the fact that most coal plants in the nation are simply too old to affordably operate.
If utilities still choose to close down a coal-fired power plant due to aging facilities or to cater to customer preferences for renewables and other cleaner forms of energy, “that’s on them,” EPA Region 8 Administrator Cyrus Western told WyoFile. But they will no longer be forced to shut down coal plants due to federal emissions regulations.

“This [repeal] gives those utilities the ability to turn around and say, ‘We now don’t have to deal with the regulations that were putting us in these really difficult situations,’ where they’re having to increase these utility bills by 20%, by 30% you know, which, obviously, we saw in Wyoming,” said Western, a Republican and former Wyoming lawmaker. “These regulated, required shutdowns are no longer a fact. That is a priority of [EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin] and the White House — to ensure that we keep these open. And if [some are] shutting down purely for economic reasons, it’s not because it’s the EPA breathing down their necks and forcing them to introduce early shutdowns.”
The repeal
EPA intends to repeal what’s commonly referred to as the “power plant rules” first established under the Obama administration. The original rules were based on the premise that greenhouse gases that contribute to the climate crisis are a pollutant, and the Obama administration admitted that the more stringent standards would require existing and new coal-fired power plants to employ carbon capture technologies to meet them.
The power plant rules were immediately mired in lawsuits, while the EPA oscillated in imposing the rules between the first Trump and Biden administrations. The U.S. Supreme Court in October declined to halt the EPA rules in the last months of the Biden administration, making Wyoming officials nervous right before the November presidential election.
Now, under President Donald Trump, the EPA is challenging the long-held notion that greenhouse gas emissions from power plants should be considered a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, according to the agency.
“EPA is proposing that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute,” the agency said.
Western added, “The people of Wyoming want affordable, reliable electricity — and they deserve it. Protecting access to low-cost, dependable power ensures families can keep the lights on without breaking the bank.”

(Photo courtesy of Ben Ackman/Jersey City Times)At least two sitting members of the Assembly appear to have lost their reelection campaigns Tuesday, though it may take days yet to determine which lawmakers will see their tenures end in January.
Democratic incumbents face defeat in the 28th and 31st districts, with the chance of another loss in the 32nd, according to election results that remain preliminary.
So far, only one incumbent, Assemblywoman Garnett Hall (D-Essex), appears certain to lose her seat in the 28th District after a single term in office. Three Democrats vied for two spots on the November ballot in this largely Democratic district.
Hall sought a second term under gubernatorial hopeful Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop’s “Democrats for Change” slogan after Essex County Democrats backed Assemblywoman Cleopatra Tucker (D-Essex) and former assistant community affairs commissioner Chigozie Onyem over Hall. Hall trails Onyem by 3,563 votes, about 12 points, with nearly 98% of the 28th District’s votes reported.
The gap between Hall and the two candidates currently in the lead is insurmountable.
In the Hudson County-based 31st District, four Democrats vied for two slots, with the incumbent Assembly members — William Sampson and Barbara McCann Stamato — running against one another on opposite slates.
Hudson County Commissioner Jerry Walker, who ran with Sampson, appears certain to ascend to the Legislature, running in first place with 8,453 votes with about 96% of the district’s votes counted. And Sampson narrowly leads McCann Stamato 7,161 to 6,853, with Bayonne Councilwoman Jacqueline Weimmer trailing the pack with 6,853 votes.
“We still have an election to go on in November, and we want to wipe Republicans out,” Walker said at a victory party Tuesday. “And look, I’m happy to say this right here: Steven Fulop, you lost.”
Walker and Sampson had the backing of the Hudson County Democratic Party. McCann Stamato and Weimmer ran under a ticket backed by Fulop.
Whoever ends up in second place in this contest, one of the 31st District’s incumbents won’t return to Trenton next year.
In the Hudson-based 32nd District, six Democrats vying for two seats were on Tuesday’s ballot. Two candidates ran with the backing of Hudson’s Democratic Party, two ran on Fulop’s slate, and two ran solo.
Former New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency chief of staff Katie Brennan leads the pack with 6,762 votes. Her running mate, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, has a narrow edge over Assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez (D-Hudson), leading Ramirez 6,535 to 6,462.
“We did it. We really did it. We just showed the whole state that the people can beat the party bosses,” Brennan said in a statement Tuesday night. “This is what democracy looks like when it’s not rigged by political machines.”
Brennan roiled Trenton in 2018 with her claim that she was raped by a staffer of Gov. Phil Murphy’s 2017 campaign.
The district also hosts what appears to be the roundest defeat of party-backed Assembly candidates in the state. The Associated Press has not declared a winner in that contest yet.
Hoboken Public Library director Jennie Pu and Jersey City buildings director Crystal Fonseca — who were backed by Hudson Democrats — are in fifth and sixth place with 5,152 and 4,964 votes, respectively. Jersey City Councilman Yousef Saleh, who ran with Ramirez on Fulop’s slate, is in fourth place with 5,165 votes. Pu, Fonseca, and Saleh face insurmountable gaps.
In the 35th District, which represents parts of Bergen and Passaic counties, independent Democrat Newark Corporation Counsel Kenyatta Stewart appears to have won the nomination with 7,298 votes due to a groundswell of support in the Passaic County portions of the district.
“Thank you to every single person who showed up, supported, and believed in this movement,” Stewart said on Facebook. “We did this together, and I am deeply humbled by your trust. Now it’s time to get to work — and I promise to make you proud every step of the way.”
He leads Assemblyman Al Abdelaziz (D-Passaic), who won 5,997 votes, and Passaic County Commissioner Orlando Cruz, who nabbed 5,736 votes. Romi Herrera, the district’s only Fulop-backed candidate, has about half as many votes as Herrera and is well out of the running.

Officials are still counting votes, and they’ll continue to receive mail ballots postmarked by 8 p.m. on Election Day until Monday.

House passes bill to raise the minimum wage,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/economy/pa-house-passes-bill-to-raise-the-minimum-wage/,"The state House voted along party lines Wednesday to raise the minimum wage to $15 for most Pennsylvanians, and to $12 for those working in smaller, rural counties.","The state Capitol in Harrisburg. (Capital-Star file)The state House voted along party lines Wednesday to raise the minimum wage to $15 for most Pennsylvanians, and to $12 for those working in smaller, rural counties.
It’s a significant step in the latest effort by Democrats to get it above the federal rate of $7.25. 
Pennsylvania’s minimum wage has not been hiked since 2008 and is lower than all surrounding states — New York, Ohio, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware.
The measure’s sponsor, House Labor and Industry Committee chair Jason Dawkins (D-Philadelphia), said the bill is in an attempt to compromise with Republicans who have long warned about the potential impacts on businesses, especially in smaller counties with a lower cost of living.
“Since I’ve been chair, we’ve been trying to figure out a different approach to get this done,”  Dawkins told the Capital-Star. “This time around, we had a little bit more insight into where our challenges lie, one particularly being that some of our counties were worried about moving too quickly, and some were not comfortable going over $12.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A previous bill sponsored by Dawkins passed the House in 2023, but died in the Republican-controlled Senate. And in 2019, the Senate passed a Democratic-led bill to raise it to $9.25, which died in the then-GOP-controlled House.
Dawkins’ latest bill would see the minimum wage rise gradually each year, reaching $15 in most counties on Jan. 1, 2028. It would also raise the tipped minimum wage from $2.83 to 60% of the minimum.
Counties with populations below 210,000, with the exception of Centre, Monroe and Pike counties, would only see the minimum wage rise to $12 in the same timeframe. A spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus said the three smaller counties were put in the $15 bracket at the request of Democratic members who represent them.
One exception to the gradual rise to $15 would be Philadelphia County, which Dawkins represents. There, the minimum wage would rise to $15 on January 1, 2026.
“Philadelphia has the highest population of folks who are in what we call deep poverty levels,” Dawkins said. 
He added there is particular urgency given the possibility some of those people may lose access to federal benefits like Medicaid and food assistance under a proposed bill moving through the GOP-controlled U.S. Congress.
“We wanted to have some type of safety net there because we know those folks might be losing benefits and other services,” he said.
But Dawkins’ attempt to offer an olive branch to GOP lawmakers in the form of gradual wage hike and a lower target in small counties appears to have failed in his own chamber. Every House Republican voted against the bill, and many criticized it during a two-hour debate on the floor Wednesday afternoon.
“Not every wage is designed to be a livable wage,” Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) “My 16-year-old son is not working for a livable wage. Someone who is retired and is helping out part-time, that is not necessarily a livable wage.”
He also warned that raising the minimum wage could result in the elimination of low wage jobs and harm small businesses in particular.
Others opposed the very provisions Dawkins said were intended to earn bipartisan support.
Rep. Kate Klunk (R-York) warned that creating different minimum wages across counties could lead to confusion for businesses that cross county lines, or encourage business owners to set up shop where the wage is lower.
“This county-based patchwork of minimum wages is going to be a mess,” Klunk said. She used examples of businesses with locations in York and Adams counties as examples, including golf courses that straddle the border between them.
“This bill is truly unworkable,” she said. “It is a compliance nightmare.”
Rep. Mike Jones (R-York) was one of few Republicans to signal openness to raising the minimum wage during debate, but said he could not support Dawkins’ bill.
“I do commend the majority chair for what I think is a good faith attempt at a reasonable compromise,” he said.
However, he added that he would want to see exceptions to the minimum wage for nonprofits and high-school aged employees.
 ‘Potential to find middle ground’
To become law, the bill will have to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said that there may be room for compromise on a minimum wage increase, especially if paired with Republican-backed deregulation efforts he said could help grow “maximum wage jobs.”
“Making sure working families have access to good, family-sustaining jobs is key to helping our commonwealth grow and thrive,” Pittman told the Capital-Star in a statement. “There is potential to finding [sic] a middle ground for an increase, but any possible action would need to be a commonsense adjustment, and sensitive to the impact changes would have on small businesses and non-profit organizations.”
Republican Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie), who has previously introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15, commended the House’s effort, but said he would not support a bill with a county-by-county approach.
“While I appreciate that the House is trying to advance the conversation, I do not support HB 1549 in its current form,” Laughlin said in an emailed statement. “A minimum wage tied to county size just deepens the economic divides we’re supposed to be addressing. If we’re going to get serious about raising the minimum wage, we need to do it uniformly across the state, not with a patchwork approach that leaves people behind based on where they live.”
Laughlin was an early Republican supporter of raising the minimum wage to $15 in Pennsylvania. But national trends may indicate more openness from members of his party this time around.
On Tuesday, conservative U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri) introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage to $15 for all Americans.
He told NBC News, “If we’re going to be a working people’s party, we have to do something for working people. And working people haven’t gotten a raise in years. So they need a raise.”
His comments reflect an openness to his party’s increasing appeal to working class voters that was made apparent in the latest general election, which saw them move away from their traditional support of Democrats.
Dawkins, the Pennsylvania bill’s sponsor, is also aware of the shift, and hopes that it will help the bill earn the support that it needs to pass.
“I’m excited by the prospects, but I’m also disappointed that there could be a federal minimum wage that’s gonna be higher than the state minimum wage — and it’s being offered by one of the most conservative members of Congress,” he joked. “But I’m hopeful it’ll help folks come around to the idea.”
“This is what I believe we got elected to do,” he added.

The measure, now awaiting action by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, would require a warning label prominently displayed on foods containing any of 44 artificial dyes and additives — a mandate that would apply to popular foods from Doritos and Skittles to Toaster Strudels and breads made with bleached flour.
It marks the first time a state, rather than the federal government, has tried to put its own warning labels on food.
While the bill passed the Texas House and Senate with bipartisan support, its sponsors are eagerly tying it to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement.
“This is about the MAHA parents and the crunchy granola parents coming together to say we are sick and tired of being sick and tired,” state Rep. Lacey Hull, who partnered with fellow Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst to sponsor the bill, told legislators before the House voted on May 25.
“I have personally spoken to the White House, who said they are looking to us, to Texas, to get this done, to stand for our children and for our future,” Hull said.
Abbott has not yet said whether he will sign the bill. It also includes other statewide health mandates, such as expanding physical activity requirements in public schools and setting new nutrition education requirements for high school and higher education students.
But the food warning label has drawn the most attention.
The label would read: “WARNING: This product contains an ingredient that is not recommended for human consumption by the appropriate authority in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the United Kingdom.”
Critics of food dyes and additives say they are most often found in low-nutrient, ultra-processed foods that promote unhealthy eating habits and contribute to chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes.
Some artificial dyes that are permitted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in foods are not recommended by its counterparts in other Western countries. European Union regulators require warning labels on some foods containing synthetic dyes, saying they may have an adverse effect on children’s activity and attention. In January, the FDA banned the artificial coloring Red No. 3, which is used in many foods and drinks in the U.S. but has been linked to cancer in animals. California became the first state to ban its use in 2023. That bill was sponsored by a Democrat and goes into effect in 2027.
But in Texas, the snack industry is pushing back. A coalition of dozens of food industry and business groups — including Walmart, General Mills and Coca-Cola — wrote a letter in opposition to the Texas bill’s warning label provision, saying it “casts an incredibly wide net” and goes too far.
“Texans deserve honest labeling; but they also deserve public policy that’s been studied, vetted, and evaluated for health considerations as well as economic impacts,” the organizations said in a letter circulated around the Texas legislature ahead of the House vote in May.
Yet opposition from some of the country’s largest food manufacturers may not be enough to halt the MAHA train.
The legislation with the labeling requirement joins other Republican-sponsored bills in the Texas legislature and around the country that reflect Kennedy’s MAHA agenda, from ending the addition of fluoride to public waters systems to loosening vaccine restrictions.
In March, West Virginia became the first state to pass a sweeping ban on synthetic food dyes. At least two dozen other states considered similar food dye bans in this most recent legislative session, according to data from the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group that pushes for removal of chemicals from food and consumer products.
At the federal level, the FDA under Kennedy’s direction has also asked the food industry to phase out certain synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, though some of the largest companies have said the timeline may not be feasible.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of the Iowa Board of Regents told the public Wednesday they are listening and slowing down the process of implementing new board policy relating to diversity, equity and inclusion in classroom instruction. Regents said whatever policy is eventually approved might look different than its current form.
Regent David Barker said a proposed policy barring universities from requiring students to take courses with “substantial content that conveys DEI or CRT (critical race theory)” to earn their credentials, with pathways to certain course exceptions, “will be an important first step” in preventing the teaching of controversial ideas as fact and raising confidence in higher education once again.
The board discussed the policy in its June 11 meeting, the first of two readings ahead of a vote for approval in July.
Under the proposed policy, students could not be required to take courses with “substantial content” covering areas “as primary principals” that include topics like antiracism, allyship, microaggressions, types of biases or privileges, social justice, critical race theory and systematic oppression, marginalization or gender theory, among others.
Mark Braun, executive director of the board of regents, acknowledged during discussion the vagueness behind the term “substantial,” but said board staff will work with the institutions to more clearly define it and demonstrate where it should apply as the policy is implemented. He emphasized that this policy would only apply to required courses and not electives.
“To a large extent, this will help highlight just how many academic programs do not require courses that meet the substantial standard,” Braun said.

Also included in the policy is an option for seeking exemption, Braun said, as the board understands some courses must include this content for different reasons. According to the policy draft, universities can submit which majors, minors and certificates should be exempted from the rules “each even-numbered year, no later than June 30.” The board must approve these requests.
Regent Christine Hensley and Barker said during the meeting they learned from the emails sent after the suggested policy was released by concerned parties, some of which Barker said were “a bit on the arrogant and pompous side” or “showed a misunderstanding of the policy.” However, what helpful information he said he received helped him determine that a better version of this first-draft policy could be developed.

The goal behind the policy is not to subdue a certain point of view, Barker said, but to prevent attempts on both sides of the political spectrum to present “contested, controversial ideas as settled fact.”
When the policy was first released, Hensley said the discussion this week was supposed to act as the first and second reading, which she said “lit a firestorm” in many people worried about the policy heading too quickly toward approval.
“I am a very, very strong proponent of when you have something that is controversial, and I would say that this has been controversial, it’s important that you take a pause — you push the pause button — you step back, and you take in information from the various groups out there,” Hensley said.
Concerns expressed from students, state officials
Critics of the proposed policy have done more than send emails to board members — some took to public comment Wednesday to express their concerns. Groups and individuals at the institutional and state level have called the revisions classroom censorship and a violation of the law.
While many of the students, faculty and citizens who spoke during public comment thanked the board for pushing the vote back, the consensus remained that the policy would harm campuses and their communities while claiming to protect student rights.
After the University of Northern Iowa faculty union published a statement opposing the policy last week, United Faculty President Christopher Martin took to public comment Wednesday to explain the three truths he sees about the proposal — first, that it was crafted from out-of-state recommendations instead of in response to major problems in Iowa, second, its implementation will act as censorship by the government, and third, it is against the law.
“There is no middle position, no position of slight appeasement,” Martin said. “Either you stand for free expression at Iowa’s universities or you don’t, and God help Iowa, its public universities and all the citizens of this state if you don’t.”
Ashley Maempa, a doctoral student studying history at the University of Iowa, said she was “deeply concerned” with both this policy, which she said was an example of over-compliance with the law, and other legislation impacting her institution and other state universities.
While the claim behind making these decisions has been that they are protecting students, Maempa said the policy would empower “a politically appointed government body to make a political decision about what concepts are merely opinions and what has legitimate scholarly basis.” The people who should be deciding what is taught in classes should be the people who are trained to do so, she said, rather than the board, whose members do not have as much experience in these matters.
“We are not political mouthpieces for whoever is in power,” Maempa said. “We are scholars, we are teachers, we are students. We ask that you vote no on this proposed policy in July, and we ask that you do your job and take a stand for academic freedom in our Legislature.”
State Sen. Herman Quirmbach, D-Ames, released a memorandum ahead of the meeting going over past legislation and current Iowa Code relating to the duties of the board and education policy in Iowa, and concluded that the board has no statutory authority to limit academic instruction in this manner and would violate Iowa law by implementing the policy.
“No recent legislation has given the Board of Regents any authority over course content regarding diversity and race or sex discrimination,” Quirmbach said in a press release.  “Moreover, existing Iowa law contains strong protections guarding the academic freedom of both faculty and students, protections that the Board’s proposed changes would violate.”
With the start date a year away, Quirmbach said in the memorandum there shouldn’t be any hurry to finalize it before campus community members have the time to fully review it, let alone form and share an opinion on what impacts they foresee. He suggested pushing the vote back to the fall to provide more time to campus constituents wishing to respond, and to the board in order to look more into the “possible legal and constitutional vulnerabilities and the risk of legal action against the Board.”
Regent Robert Cramer said during the meeting he’d like to hear from university faculty about what language they think would be best used to stop the indoctrination of students in the classroom while still ensuring they have the freedom to teach.
Hensley agreed that it was right to push the vote back, and with another reading planned before vote, Hensley said it would be all right if it doesn’t feel like the policy is ready for prime time even after seeing edits.
“This isn’t going into effect until next year, so we’ve got time to get this dealt with and dealt with correctly, and I think that should be our number one priority,” Hensley said.

The city promises that seniors will transition to the Heineberg Community Senior Center, but it’s unclear just how planned out that transition will be.

On a warm summer day, about a dozen seniors found themselves enjoying what may be one of their last meals at the Center of Recreation and Education, as Burlington’s senior center programming may end Sept. 30 following a serious round of city budget cuts.
Senior programming for Burlington is held in the Center of Recreation and Education, which is inside the Old North End Community Center on Allen Street. Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak’s budget for fiscal year 2026 seeks to end the lease the city has with the center and cut positions in the Burlington Parks, Recreation & Waterfront Department in an attempt to balance the budget; several of those cut positions are held by those working in the CORE program. 
The program includes activities for those 55 and older, including art classes, crochet and a “bone building” exercise program. Some activities  are taught by community members and nonprofits, like Age Well, which also provides daily lunches.“I love the exercise programs,” Aloyse Rowley, a regular CORE attendee, said Wednesday. “But it’s gonna be ending, all of it, and I’m really worried about what I’m gonna do.” 
The plan is to transition seniors to the Heineberg Community Senior Center, a nonprofit in Burlington, however it is unclear how planned that transition will be.
Rowley is one of multiple seniors attending CORE who use walkers or other mobility aids. The city pays for seniors to receive rides to and from the center from the Special Services Transportation Agency — a nonprofit dedicated to transportation for Vermonters with transportation challenges. But with the budget cuts, seniors like Rowley will no longer receive free transportation from the city.“I have trouble walking … and there are some ladies who have it worse than me,” she said. “What they’re doing is just leaving us on our own, which means we’re not gonna be able to go anywhere, which is very bad for our mental health, not to mention our physical health.”
Andrea Viets, executive director of the Heineberg Community Senior Center, said she is unsure whether the city will reinstate SSTA benefits for seniors transitioning to her center.
“That’s a great question, one that I have raised that I do not have an answer for,” she said.

When asked if the city planned to continue paying for the rides of seniors, Burlington Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Magee said he couldn’t “speak to any specifics of what the transition looks like,” but that “we’re certainly focusing on what the needs are that folks have and how the city can assist with that transition and making sure that folks’ needs are being met.” 
SSTA is $4 each way, meaning seniors who take the bus to and from their home will pay $8 a day in transportation costs. This adds up to around $40 a week, and up to $2,080 a year.
The city’s transition plan relies heavily on the Heineberg center, to which it provides approximately $85,000 — half their yearly budget — annually. “We’re working on a plan involving the Heinenberg center to figure out where folks can access other services,” Magee said. 
The Heineberg center currently serves around 425 seniors, with an additional 100 coming for yearly services like AARP tax aid and vaccination clinics for the flu and Covid-19.

When asked if Heineberg had the capacity for the influx of seniors from CORE programming, Viet said, “Yes and no. The yes part is that we’re not gonna turn people away. The challenging part is that there are some services that folks are accessing currently at CORE, like transportation and daily meals, that we can’t offer.” 
Heineberg is currently staffed with three part-time employees.
Daily nutritious meals are crucial to seniors like Rowley, who often struggle with the effort needed to maintain a good diet. Age Well’s meals are vetted by a nutritionist.“I think meals are very critical to seniors,” Rowley said. “Being one person, it’s very hard to cook and go get all those ingredients at this age. Some gentlemen at the center seem to never have dinner.”
Sarah Carpenter, one of the city councilors who will end up voting on whether to pass Mulvaney-Stanak’s budget, said she was surprised by the cuts. 
“The city just received an in-depth report from the council on aging about trying to increase awareness of the needs of our older citizens, including activities. So I was sort of surprised that this was the choice to eliminate as opposed to maybe [a] restructure,” she said
Carpenter is also concerned about the city not fully committing to a transition plan for seniors.
“We didn’t have a lot of transition time, and I think there needs to be a really solid sit-down and get a transition,” she said. “There really wasn’t, and really isn’t at the minute a real transition plan for the older adult activities in the city.”
Magee said the city is working on a transition plan, “and that will include meeting with the seniors who currently access programming through the core center, and figuring out what those next steps look like and how the city can be supportive in that.”Jen Williams, a senior who has been attending CORE senior programming for years, said the activities help with her mental health. 
“My son-in-law told me I couldn’t stay at home all day, all night. So I had to find some place to go,” she said. “Before I came here, I was in and out of the hospital a lot for my mental health. And since I’ve been here, I haven’t been in the hospital.”“My favorite part of being here is the sewing and the socializing,” she added. “I’ve met a lot of people since I’ve been coming. I’ll miss everybody.”

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge ruled Wednesday that a Columbia University activist detained for partaking in pro-Palestinian protests cannot be held by the federal government over allegations that his presence in the United States undermines the nation’s foreign policy interests.
U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz issued the order Wednesday but gave federal prosecutors until Friday at 9:30 a.m. to ask the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to step in. It’s unclear if the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, will be released Friday if the government does indeed appeal.
“This is the news we’ve been waiting over three months for. Mahmoud must be released immediately and safely returned home to New York to be with me and our newborn baby, Deen,” Noor Abdalla, Khalil’s wife, said in a statement from the American Civil Liberties Union of New York. “True justice would mean Mahmoud was never taken away from us in the first place, that no Palestinian father, from New York to Gaza, would have to endure the painful separation of prison walls like Mahmoud has.”
If it stands, Farbiarz’s ruling, which comes on the heels of a previous decision that said the government’s push to deport Khalil was likely unconstitutional, could deal a blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to deport dissidents.
Khalil was arrested by immigration authorities in March and has been held in Louisiana since. He’s fighting two cases to fend off his deportation — one in Louisiana and one in New Jersey, because he was being transferred through Elizabeth Detention Center when his attorneys first filed a petition for his release. 
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed Khalil supports terrorist group Hamas and called his presence in the country a national security risk. Rubio has cited a rarely used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to justify Khalil’s deportation. 
Farbiarz noted in his Wednesday ruling that the government could argue that Khalil would have been detained anyway because he inaccurately filled out his lawful permanent resident application, which can be a basis for removal under very rare circumstances. But that argument won’t work, he said. 
“Lawful permanent residents are virtually never detained pending removal for the sort of alleged omission” Khalil is accused of, the judge wrote in the 14-page filing.
Khalil, whose wife and newborn son are American citizens, has not been charged with any crime. He was among the first university students who were picked up by immigration authorities targeting pro-Palestine activists. Some students who were detained under similar circumstances have been released but still face deportation.

A Vermont dad took the Burlington Free Press to court for not covering his son’s basketball games, but a judge recently tossed out his lawsuit, citing the state Constitution’s protection of press freedom.
On May 20, Vermont Superior Court Judge Benjamin Battles dismissed Robert Lafayette’s suit against the newspaper and its subsidiary, Vermont Varsity Insider, a platform created in 2018 to provide coverage of high school sports. 
Lafayette sued the paper and two of its employees, Alex Abrami and Judith Altneau, accusing them of failing to cover high school sports outside of Chittenden County, particularly his son’s basketball games.
Lafayette alleged the Vermont Varsity Insider has focused predominantly on Chittenden County Schools — some of which have advertising and commercial interests with the news organization — despite claiming to provide statewide coverage. He claimed his son’s performances were not featured during the 2024-25 season. According to Lafayette, this hurt his son’s college prospects and caused him stress and anxiety, gastrointestinal distress and panic attacks that he had to treat with medication. 
Lafayette sued for compensatory and punitive damages for violation of the Consumer Protection Act, breach of contract, negligent infliction of emotional distress and unjust enrichment.
Battles dismissed Lafayette’s complaint, upholding Article 13 of the Vermont Constitution, which protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press, including editorial decisions on the material included in a newspaper. 
Given that Vermont Varsity Insider reported on games throughout Vermont, the judge did not find validity to Lafayette’s allegations that its coverage was not truly statewide. 
A future hearing will determine whether Lafayette will face sanctions for using fake case citations and quotes in his filings, the judge ruled. The newspaper is also entitled to attorney fees under a Vermont law known as an anti-SLAPP statute (for strategic lawsuits against public participation), which allows defendants to file a motion to strike a complaint if the lawsuit arises from the exercise of the right of free speech.
The attorney for the Burlington Free Press declined to comment Wednesday, citing pending litigation.

Kim Reynolds signed legislation Wednesday that’s intended to help keep rural pharmacies in business but could also lead to higher drug costs for Iowans.
At the urging of the state’s pharmacists, the Iowa Legislature approved the measure earlier this year. Senate File 383 imposes restrictions and regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that negotiate prescription drug prices between manufacturers, health insurance companies and pharmacies.
The law limits PBMs’ use of strategies that favor a specific pharmacy to fill a prescription — such as cost-sharing rates, fees, and other financial penalties or incentives. The legislation would also require pharmacies to be reimbursed at the average state or national price for a drug.

Supporters have claimed the law is needed to combat “anti-competitive” practices by PBMs that they say give an advantage to mail-order prescription refills and larger pharmacy chains that have greater purchasing power.
In signing the bill, Reynolds said that while PBMs have helped negotiate drug prices and access for millions of Americans, consolidation has led to only three major PBMs controlling 80% of the market, giving them “outsized power” in determining what patients pay for their medications.
“But this bill does not signify an end,” she said. “The complexity and lack of verifiable data made signing this bill a difficult decision and my administration will closely monitor implementation to mitigate and ensure that any unintended consequences for private employers are addressed.”

A Legislative Services Agency analysis found the bill could result in higher costs and co-pays for the state’s health insurance program. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry warned it could result in an additional $340 million in costs for private-sector health insurance plans and add $169 annually to the average insured Iowan’s pharmaceutical expenses.
Earlier this year, Rep. Jeff Cooling, D-Cedar Rapids, warned that while the bill may initially increase revenue for smaller pharmacies, the added cost for consumers and their employers will give Iowans even more incentive to fill their prescriptions at a lower cost through larger pharmacies.

The Iowa Pharmacy Association said the new law “marks a major victory for Iowa patients, independent and community pharmacies, and healthcare providers across the state” by ensuring greater oversight of PBMs.
“For too long, PBMs have put profits over patients, contributing to the closure of more than 200 pharmacies in Iowa since 2014,” said Kate Gainer, CEO of the Iowa Pharmacy Association. “This law gives us the tools to level the playing field and protect access to care, especially in rural areas.”

A newly published study of the mountain increases knowledge of what are known as stealthy volcanoes, like Veniaminof. (Photo by Tara Shreve/Alaska Volcano Observatory/University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute)An ice-clad behemoth among Alaska’s Aleutian Range mountains is sharing secrets about what makes some volcanoes tick — namely, ones that show little sign of erupting before they blow.
In a study published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Earth Science, scientists said they have discovered why Mount Veniaminof is so stealthy — and that information may help improve volcano forecasting and perhaps save lives. 
Named after an 18th century Russian Orthodox priest, Veniaminof is what scientists call a “stealthy volcano,” one that offers practically zero warning that an eruption is imminent. These volcanoes generally do not exhibit the typical precursors to eruptions, which may include rumbling, earthquakes, gas and steam plumes, and swollen or hot ground surfaces. 
Stealthy volcanoes can be especially hazardous when located close to population centers. Merapi in Indonesia, Galeras in Colombia, Stromboli in Italy and Popocatépetl and Colima in Mexico are examples, according to the paper.  
Unlike its more urban counterparts, Veniaminof sits in the remote Alaska Peninsula, some 480 miles southwest of Anchorage. The nearest village, Perryville, lies about 20 miles to the south. Perryville’s population totaled 81 people at last count.
Veniaminof is one of Alaska’s most active volcanoes, with 13 recorded eruptions since 1993, according to the study. Unlike Mount Redoubt, which triggered a near-disaster in 1989 when a jet bound for Anchorage lost engine power after flying into an ash cloud before recovering, or Mount Spurr, which coated Anchorage in ash and prompted airport closures during its 1992 eruption, Veniaminof’s seismic activity has caused relatively little trouble for Alaska residents.
But its eruptions seem to come out of the blue. Of Veniaminof’s 13 eruptions in the past three decades, only two produced warning signs, and a 2018 eruption went undetected until three days after it started.
The paper’s lead author, Yuyu Li, a volcanology doctoral student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, found Veniaminof’s behavior fascinating but disturbing. Given that the volcano can send ash nearly 10 miles into the atmosphere without warning, with the potential for disrupting air travel or posing other hazards, Li wanted to know more.
She and her team analyzed open-source monitoring data over three summer seasons immediately before the 2018 eruption. They created a model to understand what factors influence the likelihood of Veniaminof erupting. They considered several parameters, including magma flow rates, magma volumes and temperatures, and reservoir depths and shapes.
In a phone interview on Tuesday, Li said she and her colleagues found that a high flow of magma, or molten rock, into what’s known as a chamber increases the chances of an eruption.
The volcano may not erupt. But if magma quickly fills the chamber and an eruption does occur, the ground will likely bulge or otherwise change shape, a process called deformation. That’s something scientists would be able to detect.
They also found rapid movement of magma into a small chamber is likely to produce an eruption capable of being detected, not one without warning. 
Stealthy eruptions occur more often when a low flow of magna enters a relatively small chamber, according to the research.
The study’s results suggest that Veniaminof has a small magma chamber and a low flow of magma.
A chamber’s size and shape factor heavily into the equation. Minimal earthquakes occur when magma enters larger, flatter chambers, according to the research.
Elongated chambers seem to produce less ground disturbance or deformation. If the rock is warm, it’s less likely to crumble in ways that produce earthquakes.
Stealthy eruptions only occur when the precise conditions exist, involving the right magma flow and the right chamber size, depth and shape.
One of the paper’s big takeaways is that volcanoes with small, warm reservoirs and slow magma flows are among those that ought to be most closely watched.











The biggest hazard from any eruption in Alaska is ashfall and disruption to aviation. Anything we can do to help predict that is important.


– Dave Schneider, acting scientist-in-charge, Alaska Volcano Observatory



	Using the model created by Li and her colleagues and adding more instrumentation and real-time monitoring to stealthy volcanoes could help keep the public safer, Li said. It’s a recipe for opening the door to improved volcano forecasting. 
Dave Schneider, acting scientist-in-charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, didn’t have a chance to read the full study on Tuesday. But from what he gleaned from the news release, he said AVO scientists will evaluate it and determine if any of the findings and recommendations should be implemented.
“The biggest hazard from any eruption in Alaska is ashfall and disruption to aviation,” said Schneider. “Anything we can do to help predict that is important, given the constraints we have in terms of being able to get things in the ground and be able to interpret the data.” 
Other stealthy volcanoes in Alaska include Cleveland, Shishaldin and Pavlov. The National Volcano Early Warning System lists them, as well as Veniaminof and others, as high priority in terms of their threat level.
Highest on the threat list are Akutan, Augustine, Makushin, Redoubt and Spurr.
Logistics and finances don’t always allow for high-tech, costly instruments to be placed in as many spots as volcanologists would like or to the extent they would prefer to see. 
“Resources are finite,” Schneider said.
Eruptions from stealthy volcanoes in Alaska also tend to be less explosive and life- and property-threatening than those from volcanoes offering ample warning signs, he said. 
Right now, Spurr is by far more of an issue than Veniaminof  for volcanologists. The volcano, located about 75 miles west of Anchorage, is currently in “code yellow” status. That means low-level unrest is occurring with small earthquakes continuing beneath the surface and a weak steam plume arising from the top. 
If magma were to move closer to the surface and other eruption indications were present, like ground deformation or increased hot gases and vapor plumes, the threat level would rise and scientists would advise the public that an eruption is very likely.
In March, scientists predicted that Spurr would erupt within weeks or months but the threat has since lessened.

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A state legislator and founding member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus was booked in the Lexington County jail Wednesday, according to online jail records.
No charges were listed for 38-year-old Rep. RJ May, a West Columbia Republican.
Instead, a jail booking with his name and age indicated he was being held “pre-trial” for the U.S. Marshals Service, suggesting potential federal charges.
Federal investigators seized electronic devices from May last August. At the time, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to the SC Daily Gazette an “enforcement action” occurred in Lexington County but did not provide any other details.
A federal court filing in October provided the first public confirmation that May’s electronics were seized, though it didn’t specify where. Among the items taken were a Lenovo laptop, an Amazon tablet, four cellphones, four hard drives, four SD cards, two DVD-Rs and 19 thumb drives, according to the filing.
It indicated May could face federal criminal charges but provided no specifics on what those might be.
No court date has been set, according to the online jail record, which quickly disappeared from public view. The booking did not include a mugshot.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the arrest.
An attorney May hired to represent him following last summer’s search is no longer representing him, the office of Dayne Phillips said. Who currently represents May is unclear. A call by the SC Daily Gazette to May’s cellphone went to voicemail.
May, first elected to the House in 2020, helped launch the state affiliate of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus in spring 2022. He was the de facto spokesman of the hardline caucus feuding with the chamber’s majority GOP until news of the federal investigation.
May was asked to leave the caucus ahead of the 2025 legislative session, said Rep. Jordan Pace, R-Goose Creek, who became its chairman last July.
May was technically vice-chairman before those caucus elections, when he lost his leadership title.

He attended this year’s session but stayed quiet, not getting involved in floor debates. While no longer involved in the caucus he helped start, he continued to vote with them.
May, originally from Virginia, is married and has two children. As the owner of Ivory Tusk Consulting, he ran political campaigns for Republicans who matched his ideology.
Despite his legal troubles, he easily won re-election last year. After defeating his primary challenger in June with 68% of the vote, he faced no Democrat or third-party challenger on November’s ballot.
The district he represents spans the area of Lexington County between Cayce, Red Bank and Gaston.

(Courtesy Louder than Guns)Virginians who hold a permit to carry a concealed handgun will be able to keep it on their persons or in their cars when visiting Pennsylvania. 
Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday announced a reciprocity agreement with Virginia that allows people with Licenses to Carry Firearms to do so in both states. 
“Shortly after taking office, I asked my staff to review opportunities to maximize reciprocity agreements with willing states, and ensure all existing and future agreements protect and respect standing law and constitutional rights,” Sunday said. “Our research of law in both states revealed nothing conflicting that would disallow permit holders to carry in both states.”
The legal staff in Sunday’s office reached out to Virginia State Police leaders in early April about renewing a Memorandum of Agreement that provides “mutual recognition of a license to carry a firearm” issued by Pennsylvania and a license or permit to carry a gun issued by another state.
The permitting process is different in each state. In Pennsylvania, applicants apply through their county sheriff’s office and a background check is conducted through the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS). The application process in Virginia goes through the clerk of the circuit court of the county or city where the person lives and requires proof of handgun competency. That could include things like completing a hunter safety course or any National Rifle Association or United States Concealed Carry Association firearms safety or training course. 
The agreement, which applies only to handguns, allows a license holder from Virginia to carry a concealed handgun on their person or in a vehicle, in Pennsylvania, and vice versa, with a Pennsylvania license holder able to do the same in Virginia.
It requires permit holders to be at least 21-years-old, carry photo ID, display the permit when asked by law enforcement, and not have a concealed carry permit previously revoked.
According to Virginia State Police Superintendent Colonel Matthew D. Hanley, his state has recognized all out-of-state permits, including from Pennsylvania, since July 2016.  
In a May 21 letter to Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, he noted the execution of the agreement serves to expand the rights of Virginians since their concealed carry permits will now be recognized in the Keystone State.
Pennsylvania now has concealed carry reciprocity agreements with 30 states, including Ohio and West Virginia. State police say as of June 2, nearly 1.7 million people have a license to carry permit in Pennsylvania.

“We need our mom. I’m only 13 — I’m not going to be able to handle this all alone,” Monse, who declined to provide her last name, told the crowd. “You’re not just doing this to my family, you’re hurting other immigrant families who need their parents back home. You’re causing a lot of pain to these families by taking them away just because you have no reason to do so. I would understand if she would have done something very illegal, but in this case my mom is one of the victims.”
As the girl stopped speaking and wept, a protester called out to her, “You’re not alone.”
The protest was organized to bring attention to the recent ICE activities in New Haven and across the country, during an explosive week of national protest as the Trump administration sent the National Guard to suppress protests and detain protesters in Los Angeles.
According to New Haven Police Chief Karl Jacobson, the woman arrested in that city had a pending case in state court. 
“It’s supposed to go to court next Monday, but the charges are misdemeanors,” Jacobson said at a press conference on Wednesday. “We know the woman was detained. We don’t know the manner.”
Kica Matos, the president of the National Immigration Law Center, also spoke at the rally on Wednesday and said that advocates have worked hard for decades to achieve a reputation for the city of New Haven as a welcoming place for immigrants.
“We are outraged and appalled by what this administration is doing,” Matos said of the Trump administration. “Now they have come to our city and, in the middle of a morning, a woman taking her children to school gets grabbed by ICE, taken out of her car, in front of her children, abducted and kidnapped in this alleged democracy.”
Four employees in were also arrested by ICE while working at a Southington car wash on Monday.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker also spoke at the rally, committing to protect immigrant residents. 
“These are not just words, these are actions. We have sued the Trump administration,” Elicker said. When New Haven was named a sanctuary city by the Trump administration, with the intention of cutting off Department of Justice funds, the city sued in response. “I commit to you that we will continue to be a welcoming city that welcomes every person because it is the right thing to do, because it is something that expresses our values as a city.”
Elicker pledged to take further legal action to fight for the rights of residents.
Hope Chávez, the executive director of the Arts Council of Greater New Haven, also spoke at the rally, encouraging U.S. citizens to stand up for those without citizenship. She also discussed a Rapid Response Line that can be used to reach advocates in case of a possible ICE arrest.
“You’re gonna call that Rapid Response Line when you think you see ICE in the community — even if you’re not sure, you’re gonna call this line,” Chávez said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_1943-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) may soon have to pay $1.86 million to settle a class action lawsuit that claimed the state had failed to provide special education services for students with disabilities between the ages of 21 and 22.
That news presented a last minute complication for the Rhode Island House Committee on Finance’s fiscal 2026 state budget preparations Tuesday.
“We literally worked to, like, 15 minutes ago to do this budget,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi told reporters at a press briefing on the $14.33 billion spending plan that began after 9 p.m. Tuesday night. He cited a figure of nearly $2 million needed because of an adverse ruling against RIDE, but details were unavailable at the time.
The case of K.L. v. Rhode Island Board of Education is close to a settlement, Victor Morente, a RIDE spokesperson, confirmed via email on Wednesday morning. He said officials were still drafting a “tentative” agreement that is still subject to approval from Rhode Island District Court as well as the Council on Elementary and Secondary Education, RIDE’s governing body.
The settlement comes nearly seven years after a federal appeals court ruled that RIDE shortchanged students with disabilities in the 2010s. The class action suit began in 2014 with a single plaintiff: A Warwick parent filing on behalf of their daughter, a Rhode Island student on the autism spectrum who also had ADHD and severe anxiety. 
But the student, named K.L. in the lawsuit,  aged out of state-sponsored educational accommodations at age 21, before she could finish her high school diploma — something she should have been eligible to receive until age 22 under federal disability laws, her attorneys argued. K.L. had an individualized education program (IEP), which tailors learning for students with disabilities and helps to address their needs. These support programs are the roadmaps to ensure local schools education agencies supply students with a free and “appropriate” public education per mandates derived from the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  
Students “who were over 21 and under 22 as of February 10, 2012, or turned 21 before July 1, 2019,” Morente wrote, would be eligible for relief under the draft settlement if they did not receive their high school diploma and aged out of support services under previous Rhode Island law.  
When the case came before the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, it ruled in favor of RIDE by determining that “public education” under the federal law would not include adult learning for students with disabilities over age 21. The class members then took their case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston, which vacated the lower court’s judgment. 










We literally worked to, like, 15 minutes ago to do this budget.


– House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi during a press briefing Tuesday


Senior Judge Kermit Victor Lipez wrote in the first circuit’s October 2018 majority opinion that the lower court had relied on too “narrow” a definition of public education.
“At present, if a 21-year-old student in Rhode Island does not complete high school for a non-disability related reason — say, because she was previously incarcerated — the state will provide her the services needed to attain a secondary-school level of academic proficiency and a route to obtain a high-school level degree,” Lipez wrote. “However, if the same 21-year-old does not complete high school due to a qualifying disability, the state currently does not offer her ability-appropriate services to attain the same level of educational achievement.”
That imbalance violated disability law, the First Circuit decided, and the court boomeranged the case back to the District of Rhode Island for the two parties to determine remedies for class members.
Sonja Deyoe, the attorney representing class members since the suit’s inception, wrote in an email Wednesday that the First Circuit ruling was pivotal for disability rights in Rhode Island. 
“The law previously had limited that education until the age of 21,” Deyoe wrote. “This was a major change for disabled individuals in Rhode Island.”  
The First Circuit’s ruling predates current RIDE leadership, and in August 2019, then-new education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green issued a memo instructing how state education officials should comply with the ruling.
“It is now clear that if they have not already done so, school districts … must comply with the recent First Circuit decision and should make services available and give careful consideration to the cost of prospective compliance,” Infante-Green wrote, adding that it was still unclear “how appropriate remedies will be provided to those eligible class members.” 
Deyoe echoed that sentiment, saying that determining damages under the lawsuit “did span a very long time,” with both parties trying to avoid forcing a legal decision as to whether individual class members could receive relief for damages.  
“Whether individualized compensatory education damages could be awarded to the individual class members was always disputed by the RI Department of Education,” Deyoe said.
The settlement also needs to be approved by the members of the class, Deyoe said. The currently draft spares class members from having to undergo individual trials to determine compensational education benefits.
“We are very hopeful the settlement will be approved, but the class members always have the opportunity to object and the Court may approve the settlement only with certain changes,” Deyoe wrote. “We cannot predict that yet…While all of this took a long time to achieve, we do believe this is a good resolution for the class members.”
The funding source to resolve the settlement was not immediately available from RIDE or the House on Wednesday. 
But Shekarchi detailed in a statement over email that the sudden news had cost the House some time on Tuesday. 
“After the budget is posted for consideration by the House Finance Committee 48 hours in advance, there are always a number of policy decisions, options and calculations that must be finalized,” wrote the Speaker. “The notification of a $1.86 million additional expense on the morning of the budget adoption certainly complicated the final process.”

(Allan Swart/Getty Images)Seven Arkansas families with children in public schools filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday to block the implementation of a new state law requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms. 
Northwest Arkansas parents and their minor children who identify as Jewish, Unitarian Universalist, Humanist, agnostic, atheist and nonreligious filed the complaint Wednesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas against the Fayetteville, Springdale, Bentonville and Siloam Springs school districts. 
The plaintiffs are asking a judge to declare the law unconstitutional and are seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions to prevent the school districts from complying with the law, according to the complaint. 
Act 573 of 2025 requires that “a durable poster or framed copy of a historical representation of the Ten Commandments” be “prominently” displayed in public school classrooms and libraries, public institutions of higher education, and public buildings and facilities maintained by taxpayer funds. 
According to the law, posters shall be donated or purchased with funds through voluntary contributions to a local school board, building governing entity or the Building Authority Division. Posters that don’t meet specifications required by the law may be replaced with public funds or private donations.
In a statement, plaintiff Samantha Stinson said that as American Jews, she and her husband “deeply value the ability to raise our children in our faith, without interference from the government.” Fellow plaintiff Carol Vella agreed, noting that her children are among a small number of Jewish students at their school.
“The classroom displays required by Act 573 will make them feel like they don’t belong simply because they don’t follow the government’s favored religion,” she said. “The displays will also violate core Jewish tenets, which emphasize tolerance and inclusion and prohibit evangelizing others.”
The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas, the ACLU, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett serving as pro bono counsel, according to a press release. 


Let us know what you think...


 

The complaint alleges Act 573 violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
“As a result of the Ten Commandments displays mandated by Act 573, Arkansas students—including the minor-child Plaintiffs—will be unconstitutionally coerced into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state’s favored religious scripture, and they will be pressured to suppress their personal religious beliefs and practices, especially in school, to avoid the potential disfavor, reproach, and/or disapproval of school officials and/or their peers,” the complaint states.
By mandating a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments be displayed, “Act 573 adopts an official position on religious matters, violating the Establishment Clause’s prohibition against taking sides in questions over theological doctrine,” according to the complaint.
In a statement, Americans United for Separation of Church and State President and CEO Rachel Laser said the Constitution’s guarantee of the separation of church and state means families, not politicians, decide if and how public school children engage with religion.
Federal judge considers letting Arkansas Supreme Court rule first on 10 Commandments monument case

“This law is part of the nationwide Christian Nationalist scheme to win favor for one set of religious views over all others and nonreligion — in a country that promises religious freedom. Not on our watch,” Laser said. 
Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, and Rep. Alyssa Brown, R-Heber Springs, sponsored Act 573, but the merits of the legislation were largely presented in committee hearings by WallBuilders, a group “emphasizing the moral, Christian, and constitutional foundation on which our nation was built,” according to its website. 
Supporters of the measure emphasized the Ten Commandments as a historical document, an argument rejected in Wednesday’s complaint. 
“This nation’s core founding documents — the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights — were not based on the Ten Commandments, and there is no longstanding history or tradition of prominently and permanently displaying the Ten Commandments in public-school classrooms,” the complaint states.  
The complaint cites longstanding court precedent, including Stone v. Graham, a 1980 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky law mandating classroom displays of the Ten Commandments as unconstitutional. 
A federal district court ruled last year that a Louisiana law similar to Act 573 violates the First Amendment. Plaintiffs in that case, which is on appeal, are represented by the same counsel as the Arkansas lawsuit, according to the press release. 
Plaintiffs in the Arkansas case plan to file a motion for preliminary injunction, which will ask the court to issue an order temporarily preventing implementation of the law, set to take effect Aug. 5, while the lawsuit is pending, according to the release.

(Photo by Nicole Girten, Daily Montanan)Landowners in Montana are not paying their fair share of wildfire costs to the tune of at least $30 million, according to a new report from the Legislative Audit Division.
An audit of the state’s Wildfire Assessment Program found problems with the funding structure for fighting wildfires and made suggestions to the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and the Legislature to overhaul the system.
The Wildfire Assessment Program is overseen by the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation. Fees are assessed to some property owners in high-risk fire areas, but the report noted the state gives an “estimated annual subsidy of over $30 million” to private landowners. 
It said the payment split in Montana is more than six decades old, and not at all even, with landowners paying just 10% of fire costs. Best practices, which the report based on extensive interviews and document review, would have them paying more than 90%. Montana spent more than a half billion dollars on fire suppression from 2002 to 2023.
Suppression is one of three wildfire activities in which the state partakes — mitigation and readiness are also ways it spends money on fires.
In 2023, for example, the state spent $41 million on fires — $4.5 million on attempts to mitigate risk and damage from fires, $13.5 million on capacity and ability to dispatch firefighters and then $23.1 million on actual suppression efforts. Landowners do not pay the state for suppression efforts.
The report suggested some fixes, including shifting the burden of wildland fire protection to those who live in the most dangerous areas.

Statewide, landowners paid just $4.3 million on wildfire protection fees in 2023. Their cost is also calculated out of the “readiness” portion of money spent on fires, not mitigation or suppression. This categorization leads to issues, the report noted.
“Applying the proportions to the readiness budget instead of total wildfire protection decreases the amount landowners are responsible for paying and increases economic inefficiency,” the report stated.
The DNRC said it has “historically excluded” response and suppression efforts from its definition of “wildland fire protection,” whereas the report’s findings look to combine preventative measures with active firefighting where funding is concerned.
DNRC director Amanda Kaster said in a letter in response to the audit that it “proposes a significant philosophical shift” in the state fire program’s funding structure. The report also suggested the agency isn’t always following statute, while the DNRC said it interprets the laws differently.
“The Montana Legislature and stakeholders have confirmed and reinforced this distinction since the creation of the fire suppression fund in 2007, which is designated primarily for wildland fire suppression activities,” Kaster wrote in response to the audit. “In contrast, the program base budget for wildland fire protection work has been widely understood to be intended for conducting work related to preparedness. The audit report fails to recognize this distinction and risks misrepresenting the DNRC’s efforts to comply with statute.”
This matters for landowners, because the report makes a case they should be paying for more than preemptive mitigation. 
The report said best practice would be for private landowners to pay 92% of wildfire suppression, readiness and mitigation costs. That number is currently about 10% and does not include suppression. According to the report, applying state law as written would ask landowners to completely cover mitigation efforts, which would increase landowner contribution to 33% of wildfire cost.

Kaster asked for clarification from the legislature on several terms, including “annual operation assessment plan,” “fire protection costs,” and “state’s portion of the cost.”
She also said it was the Legislature’s job to make decisions about what people are paying, not the DNRC.
“The DNRC does not believe it is our responsibility, nor do we have the appropriate standing, to make recommendations on how or why the cost burden of the program is shared amongst Montanans,” Kaster wrote. “Ultimately, it is the legislature that chooses how to fund this work, and it is our obligation to respond to wildfires on behalf of the State of Montana.”
Kaster also noted an upcoming wildland firefighting study, passed as House Bill 70 this session, will lead to “further clarification” and funding expectations.
Fees collected from property owners come mainly from fire protection districts, where residents who contribute get a more direct response. Some property owners within these districts are required to pay — according to the report, it’s a $50 per-owner, per-district charge, and then a $0.30 per-acre charge for each acre owned in a district more than 20 acres.
However, Gov. Greg Gianforte recently signed HB 421. That legislation increased fire protection fees for land classified as forest from $50 to $58.70 for each landowner; for those with more than 20 acres of land, there’s an additional fee per acre that increased from $0.30 to $0.49.
The process for deciding who has to pay is complex and is maintained by one full-time staffer with assistance from two other DNRC employees and a seasonal intern, the audit report noted.
  This map shows who is required to pay a fire fee in Montana. (Graphic from Legislative Audit Division report)
It went on to say the Fire Assessment Programs manual is also outdated, employees don’t understand technical aspects of the fee program software code, and if the department lost employees who work in the program, they would be difficult to replace.
“Department staff spend significant time manually reviewing and updating information as part of the fee assignment process,” the audit noted. “Department staff stated they cannot determine if a fee should be assigned to over 2,000 properties each year due to a lack of time to review the properties and a lack of updated property data.”
The current split for fire protection costs is based on a 1958 national study by the Battelle Memorial Institute. Beyond being six decades old, it did not account for individual states, meaning what Montana is using to calculate the share isn’t even based on data unique to the state.
“Recommendations include recalculating the public and private funding share, clarifying statute, and establishing a fee structure informed by cost and wildfire risk data, and improving data practices to help determine efficient funding and areas of elevated wildfire response,” the audit report stated.
According to an Oct. 2024 presentation from the Legislative Fiscal Division, about 63% of all homes in Montana are in the wildland urban interface, a term used to describe high fire danger areas where natural land and housing meet. About 1.5% of Montana falls within the area considered the wildland urban interface. The presentation noted this was not the best way to assess fire risk in Montana, but did not specify why.
The DNRC has the direct responsibility of protecting about 5 million acres of land in Montana. Additionally, the state also shares responsibility — primarily with local governments — for an additional 55 million acres, while the federal government is the primary responder for 33 million acres. 
Montana is slightly more than 94 million acres in total.

Republish photo only with original article.)The Ohio Senate has passed a $60 billion state biennial operating budget, which includes a tax cut for the wealthy, some increased public education funding, and $600 million in funding to the Cleveland Browns for their new stadium.
The total budget is expected to be around $200 billion once federal dollars come in.
Ohio House Bill 96 was voted on mainly along party lines, 23-10. State Sen. Bill Blessing, R-Colerain Township, joined the Democrats to vote no.
School funding
The senators increased the amount of money going to public schools from the Ohio House’s proposal. The Senate budget gives public schools about $100 million more than the House.
Although they follow most of the Ohio House’s proposed budget, which only gives schools about $226 million of an increase for school funding, the Senate changed the funding “guarantee” amount. Right now, some districts have guarantees that a portion of their funding will not be reduced, even if their enrollment goes down
This $100 million added back would only go to high-performing or “improving” districts.
However, to be fully funded based on statistics from the Fair School Funding Plan (FSFP) from 2021, schools would need an additional $666-800 million, compared to the $226 million given by the House. Still, the Senate’s version is closer to the FSFP than the House’s.
“We’re following the funding scheme that was put together in the first place,” Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said. “Our bill is the closest way to get there.”
They also raised the House proposal’s cap on districts’ rainy day funds to 50%, instead of 30%. This would mean that the schools would have to refund anything above that back to the taxpayer to provide property tax relief.
“The priority is not, obviously, in fully funding education, investing in our children and our future,” Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said.
Browns
The Senate’s budget proposal still includes $600 million for a new Cleveland Browns stadium in Brook Park. However, the funding structure differs from what the Browns proposed and what the House approved earlier this year.
The House proposed borrowing $600 million by issuing bonds and repaying the debt, with interest, over 25 years, at a cost of about $1 billion.
The Senate is proposing a $600 million grant for the stadium using unclaimed funds. That’s other people’s money that the state is holding, from things like forgotten bank accounts, rent, or utility deposits or uncashed insurance policies.
The Ohio Department of Commerce’s website states the state is sitting on $4.8 billion in unclaimed funds.
Asked about the possibility of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoing that provision, Cirino noted that DeWine said publicly he did not like the debt arrangement of the House for the $600 million. DeWine himself had proposed raising gambling taxes.
“I’m pretty confident and feel good that the governor and the House will look at our approach to it,” Cirino said.
Ohio Democratic lawmakers remain staunchly opposed to the project.
“If they could find that money for the Browns and their stadium’s move to Brook Park, why didn’t they decide to use those funds for the schools?” Antonio asked.
Income tax
The budget also includes a 2.75% flat income tax.
There are three income tax brackets in Ohio. Those making up to $26,000 do not need to pay state income tax. Ohioans earning between $26,000 and $100,000 pay a tax of 2.75%. Those making more than $100,000 have to pay 3.5%.
State data reveals that this flat tax could result in a loss of about $1.1 billion in the General Revenue Fund.
“The dollars that we’re foregoing in the flat tax are already incorporated into our overall spending,” Cirino said.
Funding for schools, Medicaid, libraries, lead abatement, food banks, and child care face funding decreases from the current status or from the governor’s budget.
Asked about these cuts these cuts to social services for lower-income people while giving a tax cut to the state’s highest earners, Cirino said Republicans think it’s going to be good for the economy.
“It’s going to be good for attracting people,” Cirino responded.
Antonio disagreed.
“It’s a gift to the wealthiest among us on the backs of the poorest and lowest-income and middle-class folks in the state of Ohio,” she said.
College aid
Senate Republicans propose giving $20,000 to top high school students to encourage them to stay in the state for their higher education.
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was passed in the House budget. Already existing, the House language would extend the proposal that gives the top 5% of each graduating high school class $5,000 a year to attend a public or private school in Ohio.
But the Senate version reduces the scholarship to the top 2% of students. The money would also have strings attached.
The scholarship recipients would be required to reside in Ohio for three years after graduation. There would be an “expectation” that the money would be returned if they leave within the three years.
Next steps
Now, the Senate and House leaders will enter a conference committee, a closed-door negotiation period to create a final budget.
Once a decision is made, both chambers must pass the combined bill. If it passes through both sides, it will be sent to Gov. Mike DeWine for review. In the past, he issued dozens of line-item vetoes on operating budgets.
Line-item vetoing is the ability for the governor to pick and choose which policies within a larger piece of legislation get to stay or must go.
The deadline for the budget to be passed is July 1.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s tribal nations contributed $23.4 billion to the state’s economy in 2023, according to a study released Wednesday. 
Over 55,000 Oklahomans were directly employed by tribes and nearly 140,000 jobs were supported for both tribal citizens and non-citizens, the tribal-backed study found. This totals more than $7.8 billion in wages and benefits in 2023. 
Matthew Morgan, chairman of the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association, said the report “speaks volumes” to the impact tribes have on the state. 
“I think Oklahoma should be very blessed to see the impacts that tribes are having across the state. It’s something that they can always look to as well,” Morgan said. “Tribes aren’t going anywhere. We’re not some private industry that will decide to move our headquarters. We’re not going to be sending our money to shareholders across the country or across the world. All that money, all of those businesses, all of those programs and services turn over in our communities multiple times.”

The study, conducted by Kyle Dean, an economics professor and director of the Center for Native American & Urban Studies at Oklahoma City University, used 2023 data from 19 participating tribes. There are 38 federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma. 
Dean has compiled three previous reports, published in 2012, 2019 and 2021.
A product of a joint effort between the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association and United for Oklahoma, a public education initiative supported by a coalition of tribes, the study found that between the 2019 and 2023 budget years, tribal economic activity grew $4.9 billion. 
Around $7.4 billion in revenue was generated by tribal gaming and “related businesses.”
The report shows “tribal contributions to the state are both reliable and enduring,” Dean said at an event Wednesday revealing the findings. 
“I have to say that I’m unsurprised by the results,” Dean said. “The impact is extraordinary, but it no longer surprises you. The level and growth of impact is consistent.”

Over a third of the visits to tribal gaming and entertainment properties were from out-of-state, according to a 2019 report. This is indicative of the impact gaming has, pulling in tourism that also benefits the surrounding local communities, Morgan said. 
Oklahoma’s tribes have exclusivity over gaming through compacts with the state. In exchange, tribes send a portion of the revenues to the state. 
With the education portion of their exclusivity fees, tribes contributed $351 million for Oklahoma education programs in 2023, according to the report. 
Leaders of six tribal nations celebrated the results of the study Wednesday at the Oklahoma History Center. Each touted the medical centers, homes, education programs, businesses and public infrastructure their tribes funded, often with gaming and tourism as the primary revenue source.
“Gaming revenue for us is just a vehicle that gets us to do all of the things that we want to do for our people and for the surrounding community,” Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma Chairman Jacob Keyes said. “We’re grateful to have that ability. But, it’s only growing, and the more gaming grows, the more that impact grows for us.”

Oklahoma tribes spent $133.6 million on tribal education programs and scholarships. They donated $39.3 million to Oklahoma communities and universities. 
Another $582 million was spent on health care services for over 3.5 million unique patient visits, the study found.
Tribal leaders said they often provide services and create jobs in rural areas that would have few resources otherwise. 
Choctaw Nation Principal Chief Gary Batton pointed to the drone research and development center established in the small southeast Oklahoma community of Daisy.
“It’s a place where nobody would invest except the Choctaw Nation, and tribes do this all across their various reservations,” Batton said.

The report shows that Oklahoma tribal governments are “doing everything they can” to uplift people in the state and “love” working with other governments to ensure the benefits are “felt across the state,” Morgan said.  
“I think the most positive thing that comes from this is that we have objective numbers to walk into the Chamber of Commerce or the state Capitol, and show people the contributions that tribal governments are making across the state,” he said. “… We want to be proud of what we’re doing, but we also want to relay the point that we’re at the table, we’re a part of Oklahoma, and we’re ready to make Oklahoma the best it can be in working together.”

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
Gov. Phil Scott has vetoed a bill that would have regionalized and privatized Vermont’s homelessness response system.
In a message to the Legislature explaining his decision late Wednesday, Scott argued that the bill “does not adequately reduce the size or cost” of the motel voucher program. The five-term Republican has called for the downsizing of the emergency housing benefit for years.
“Rather than continuing to fund a program that isn’t good for those in it, I believe we should focus on real solutions like building additional shelter capacity and requirements to engage in work, training, and treatment for those who need it,” Scott wrote.
The bill, H.91, would have in fact dissolved the statewide motel voucher program as it currently exists. After a year of planning, it would have handed over funding and decision-making power for emergency shelter to five regional anti-poverty nonprofits and the statewide domestic violence organization. 
Those same groups would have had authority over funds the state currently doles out to build and operate local shelters and run homelessness prevention programs. The state would have retained an oversight role.
The change would have marked a fundamental pivot in how Vermont approaches homelessness, which has increased by more than 300% since before the Covid-19 pandemic began amid a crushing housing shortage and rising housing costs.

The bill’s Democratic supporters in the Legislature argued it would have created a more efficient and integrated support system for Vermont’s growing homeless population — and allowed the state to stop relying on motel and hotel rooms to shelter the bulk of unhoused Vermonters, an issue that has become a perennial flashpoint at the Statehouse in the years since pandemic-era federal aid for shelter dried up.
Scott, a Republican, has long pushed for the motel voucher program’s expansion to end, arguing that it is too expensive – and ineffective – to continue on the state’s dime. Lawmakers have haltingly agreed to winnow down its scale over the last few years, setting new restrictions on eligibility that have resulted in relentless waves of evictions. 
H.91 was the closest lawmakers and officials had come to overhauling the motel voucher system – and the broader state apparatus for responding to homelessness.
Early on this legislative session, officials from Scott’s administration had expressed general support for the restructuring H.91 envisioned. In some ways, the proposal to shift the motel voucher program to regional community action agencies mirrored a push the Scott administration had made right before Covid-19 hit.
But in the waning weeks of the session, officials and lawmakers found plenty of details to argue about, from concerns around the costs of the new regionalized approach to disagreements over how quickly it should happen. 
Legislators attempted to make concessions to the administration as they finalized the bill, lowering an appropriation meant to aid the transition to the new system this year and striking provisions that expressed an intent to tie future emergency housing spending to recent years’ budgets – creating a possibility for the state to spend less in the future.
Those changes weren’t enough to earn Scott’s signature. In his veto message, Scott claimed “this bill proposes we spend millions of dollars more” than the $44 million budgeted for the motel program last year. He noted that, by comparison, the state appropriated $5 million for motels in 2019. 
Advocates for unhoused Vermonters decried Scott’s decision.
“Throughout the coming years, Vermonters will lose access to their permanent housing vouchers due to upheaval in Washington and inhumane policies,” wrote Brenda Siegel, executive director of End Homelessness Vermont, in a statement. “Governor Scott has left vulnerable Vermonters with no options, no solution and no hope.”
Both the House and Senate passed the final versions of H.91 with party-line votes. Without a Democratic supermajority, lawmakers are unlikely to have the votes to override the governor’s veto. Staff for legislative leadership did not offer details on their next steps forward Wednesday evening.
Scott’s decision leaves the motel program operating at its status quo – with strict time-limits on motel stays for all participants and a cap on the number of rooms in use during the warmer months of the year – for the foreseeable future.
And it leaves Vermont’s political leaders that much further apart on addressing the state’s worsening homelessness problem.

Free.,U.S. Senate GOP tries to ease the pain for states in sharing costs of SNAP benefits,"Jacob Fischler, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-gop-tries-ease-pain-states-sharing-costs-snap-benefits,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Republicans will propose more moderate changes to the major federal food assistance program than their House counterparts, Senate Agriculture Chairman John Boozman said Wednesday, detailing a provision in a giant tax and spending cut bill that would penalize states less harshly than the House GOP version.The Agriculture section of the Senate’s budget reconciliation bill, like the House version that passed last month 215-214, would create the possibility that states for the first time would shoulder some of the cost of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits starting in 2028.But unlike the House version, the Senate’s language would allow states an opportunity to avoid paying anything if they hit an efficiency benchmark, Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, told reporters at the Capitol.The highest share states would be responsible for would be 15% under the Senate’s proposal, down from 25% in the House version.Boozman said Senate Republicans sought to temper the House proposal, which would impose a minimum 5% cost-share on all states, with most states paying for 25% of the benefits.The House approach would saddle states with at least around $5 billion per year for the program that provides about $100 billion per year in benefits, but the actual costs to states would likely be much higher.“A lot of people were concerned about the significant bill to the states with the 5% cost-share,” Boozman said. “So this was an effort that’s the best of both worlds in the sense that it allows the states, through efficiencies, to make it such that they don’t have to worry about that, but we still recoup the money.”In practice, the House plan would likely impose closer to $14 billion per year in new costs to states because most would not qualify for the lowest cost-share, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that also projected that more than 3 million people would lose benefits under the House plan.The changes to SNAP are part of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” that would also extend the 2017 law that provided individual and corporate tax cuts, bolster federal spending on border security and defense, overhaul and cut portions of the Medicaid health care program, and much more.GOP leaders are moving the package through the complex reconciliation process, which has strict rules in the Senate and will likely include a marathon amendment voting session later this month, known as a vote-a-rama.Lower savingsThe federal government currently pays for all costs of SNAP benefits. House Republicans argued that left states without an incentive to reduce errors in payments and proposed the requirement that states share some of the cost in proportion to their error rates in administering SNAP benefits.The Senate would also peg a state’s cost-share to its error rate, but would make states’ costs lower across the board.States with error rates at 5% or lower would continue to not pay anything for their SNAP benefits, and states with error rates from 10% or higher would pay for 15% of benefits. The Senate bill would also create two intermediate levels, Boozman said.The national error rate in 2023, the most recent year for which data is available, was 11.7%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. More than two dozen states had error rates of 10% or more.The Senate’s proposed changes to the cost-share would result in a lower federal savings than the House version, Boozman said. His version would save about “$52 or $53 billion,” about $20 billion less than the House version, he said. It’s not clear where those savings might occur instead.The Senate would also exclude a provision of the House bill that would have changed the cost-share of administering SNAP. States currently pay for 25% of administrative costs, with the federal government picking up the rest of the bill. The House bill would change that rate to 50% each.A smaller tweak on the Senate side would exempt single parents of children younger than 10 from meeting work requirements. The House bill would set that age at 7 years old. No age limit currently exists.ReconciliationThe differences between House and Senate Republicans are among several issues the chambers will negotiate in the coming weeks as Republicans seek to pass the massive legislative package through the procedure known as budget reconciliation.The process involves several committees writing bills that the Senate Budget Committee then packages together before sending it to the floor.Full language of the Senate Agriculture Committee’s instructions would be published late Wednesday, Boozman said.The reconciliation process allows Senate Republicans to skirt the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold for legislation.But with razor-thin majorities in each chamber — and a host of policy disagreements among Republicans — GOP leaders face a delicate task in crafting a bill that can pass both chambers.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Editor's note:  This story has been updated to correct terminology regarding the credentialing and certification of therapeutic riding instructors in Missouri.

SPRINGFIELD – Under a bill awaiting the governor’s signature, certain insurance plans would have to cover hippotherapy and other forms of therapeutic horseback riding in Illinois.

Hippotherapy is a type of physical, occupational and speech therapy where the movement of a horse is used to treat a patient’s specific disability or disorder. The practice is used to treat conditions such as autism, cerebral palsy, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, strokes, head and spinal cord injuries, as well as behavioral disorders and psychiatric disorders, including PTSD.

Marita Wassman is the founder of Ride On St. Louis, a nonprofit organization that provides equine-assisted services to both children and adults in the St. Louis area. As one of five credentialed and certified therapeutic riding instructors at the advanced level in Missouri, Wassman’s stable has provided services to patients for over 27 years – the majority of whom she says are children needing physical or intellectual services.

A previous patient of Ride on St. Louis was an 8-year-old girl with cerebral palsy who struggled to hold her head upright on her own for extended periods of time. After four months of treatment, Wassman said the girl’s parents reported that she was able to both sit and hold her head up for over an hour when they went out to dinner – when previously, she would rest her head on her arms for a majority of the dinner.

“If you were to go ride a horse for an hour, it could benefit you exactly the same way as if you did a powerwalk for an hour,” Wassman said. “And for people specifically who can’t get that on their own, who are in wheelchairs or even if they are ambulatory but don’t have a symmetrical movement, sitting on a horse that is nice and even is really going to help their muscles.”

During sessions, a licensed therapist typically works alongside a horse handler, who confer with each other beforehand about the patient’s goals and the variables that would affect the session – like the breed of the horse and the activities that would be most beneficial to the patient.

“Horses movements are very different – you can have a horse that makes your hips and your pelvis have a lot more anterior and posterior movement, or forwards and backwards movement, or some of them are going to deliver more lateral movement,” Wassman said. “So, if you’re working with a person with cerebral palsy who is weak in their spine and they need to develop their anterior and posterior muscles more, you’re going to want to make sure they’re on a horse that has a movement that is more front and back.”

Beyond horseback riding, Wassman said there are a variety of other factors that make the practice effective. For some patients, being outside and partaking in a shared experience surrounded by supportive professionals can be emotionally uplifting, which she said may provide a sense of engagement and community.

Another aspect of the services sometimes involves overcoming fear for patients with anxiety, Wassman said. Since horses are large, intimidating creatures, overcoming a fear of the horse as well as engaging in and developing skills related to riding can help specific patients with self-esteem.

Equine-assisted service specialists like Wassman also report that horses seem to have a calming effect on patients, which Wassman attributes to their heart rates. Because they’re such large animals, horses have lower heart rates than humans, which she said soothes both humans and animals near a horse.

“A lot of times people’s breathing will kind of relax or slow down when they’re near or around the horses,” she said.

Some patients may not ride a horse but instead will simply interact with one during their session, she said. Occupational therapists may choose to treat a patient’s physical mobility by brushing a horse, especially when other forms of typical treatment aren’t working.

“It’s kind of like baking,” Wassman said. “When you’re baking, you use flour, sugar, salt, water, milk or whatever in so many of your baking recipes, but you don’t know what the outcome is going to be unless you specifically have your recipe. You could make pancakes, you could make crispy cookies, you could make chewy chocolate chips cookies, or whatever.

“It’s the same thing with equine-assisted services – what specific goals and objectives you have for each of those specific riders breaks down to your lesson plans and your treatment plans and everything that you’re writing to try help that person.”

She told another previous patient’s story – one who quickly attained results after previously making little progress in traditional therapy settings.

“The patient’s mother goes, ‘We did eight years of physical therapy. Then we came and started doing physical therapy on horseback, and we achieved so much more in six weeks than in eight years.’” Wassman said.

Wassman said the insurance aspect of equine-assisted services has always been a point of contention for stables and therapists in the past, as some insurance companies have fought compensating therapists for their hippotherapy services. At stables where other services are offered, she said patients and their parents can often get confused about what services insurance will and won’t cover.

“For services that are not involved with an occupational or physical therapist, speech therapist, or mental health professional, you cannot bill insurance,” she said. “There’s a lot of stables out there that don’t employ therapists but still provide services.”

Senate Bill 69 passed the Senate unanimously in April as well as the House in late May on a vote of 78-33. It will become law if signed by Gov. JB Pritzker.

(Photo by fhm | Getty Images)Even before the Public Service Commission approved a settlement that meant a 28% rate increase for NorthWestern Energy customers, Chris Blazer’s friend struggled.
Blazer, of Helena, said her friend lives on just $2,000 a month.
“Even five years ago, before the big rate increases, she was living in darkness and cold so that she could feed herself and her horses,” Blazer said.
Blazer made her comments Wednesday to the Public Service Commission during a hearing on the monopoly utility’s rate case. She said some people do not realize the impact so-called “minor increases” have on customers’ lives.
In August 2022, NorthWestern Energy’s electric customers paid $91.27 a month, according to its own records.
On July 1, likely before the PSC issues an order in the current case, those same customers could be paying $127.24, a 39.4% increase in three years.
NorthWestern Energy said rates could drop compared to the current rate if the PSC approves a settlement in the case — the PSC put June rates at $118.20 for the average electric customer.
But a couple of other adjustments are pending in the meantime, and a group of organizations intervening in the case are asking commissioners to take a closer look at costs.
At the hearing this week, a lawyer representing the group also quizzed a NorthWestern Energy vice president about the utility’s response to an earlier order requiring the utility to assess its programs to help people with lower incomes.
In a discussion about rate increases nationally, PSC President Brad Molnar said Montana customers pay the 12th lowest electric rates in the U.S.
“So we’re actually living pretty well,” Molnar said.
***
On the witness stand earlier in the week, NorthWestern Energy CEO Brian Bird agreed with Commissioner Annie Bukacek’s perspective that the utility’s rates are reasonable in comparison to other expenses people pay.
Bird said coffee can be $5 and a Big Mac meal can be $9.99. By comparison, he said, NorthWestern Energy powers all appliances in a person’s home and supplies all of its natural gas for $6 a day.
“I think people don’t really appreciate that when we can do that as affordably as we have,” Bird said.
Customer Jocelyn Leroux, however, said NorthWestern Energy executives don’t appreciate the financial pressures Montanans face — for some, an extra $20 on a bill is money that used to pay for groceries.
“Imagine having to choose between sweating through the night to save on electricity, or turning on the air conditioning, and going light on food for the week,” said Leroux, with the Montana chapter of the Sierra Club. “These are the kinds of calculations that many people are forced to make.”
She said the reason customers are forced into these choices is NorthWestern executives “seem to be prioritizing their own financial status” over more affordable and cleaner energy sources — despite all the wind and solar potential in Montana.
A NorthWestern Energy shareholder report on the utility’s website outlined compensation for executive officers in 2024, including salary, stocks, deferred compensation and other pay:

Brian Bird, CEO: $4.81 million
Crystal Lail, CFO: $1.74 million
Shannon Heim, general counsel: $1.00 million
Bobbi Schroeppel, VP customer care, communications, HR: $892,457
John Hines, VP, supply/MT government affairs: $929,887

In an introduction to the report, Bird encouraged shareholders to review the information in preparation for an April 30th meeting. The executive pay section describes its aim.
“Our executive pay program is designed to align the long-term interests of our executives, shareholders, and customers,” the report said.
  (From a NorthWestern Energy shareholder report on its website.)
But some Montanans still need help paying the bills.
Tuesday, lawyer Jenny Harbine asked if NorthWestern Vice President Schroeppel had reviewed data that showed 20% to 50% of Montana households with incomes of less than $75,000 said they needed to reduce or forego spending on basic necessities to pay their utility bills.
Harbine represents a group of organizations that are asking the PSC to reject a settlement in the case.
They argue NorthWestern is falling short when it comes to responsibly planning for the future, taking climate change into account and ensuring reasonable bills, especially for customers with lower incomes.
When it comes to household budgets, though, Schroeppel said the reverse is true at times, and some households forgo paying their electric bills to afford other items.
Harbine also wanted to confirm some of those families might not be buying daily lattes and burgers.
“Can we agree that Mr. Bird’s testimony about the cost of a daily soda or Big Mac or coffee may overlook the experience of these families?” Harbine asked.
“I can’t speak to that,” said Schroeppel, vice president of customer care, communications and human resources.
Harbine asked if Schroeppel was aware the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program reached only 15% of the eligible population in Montana in 2024.
Schroeppel said she’s seen numbers as high as 20% across the state. However, she said the figure includes customers served by other utilities.
In response to Harbine, however, she conceded the majority of that population is made up of NorthWestern customers, although she also said LIHEAP is a program run through the state health department, not the utility.
In an order in January 2024, the Public Service Commission directed NorthWestern Energy to evaluate the efficacy of low-income energy assistance programs.
The PSC ordered the utility to, “at a minimum,” address information gaps about trends in affordability for low-income customers, barriers to programs, and the most effective outreach.
Harbine wanted to know if NorthWestern had made any changes since the order. 
The group Harbine represents is comprised of the Montana Environmental Information Center, the Human Resource Council District XI, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the NW Energy Coalition.
Schroeppel said the utility had not made changes, “but I don’t read the commission order to indicate that that’s what they were looking for.”
Rather, she said, the directive was to pull a stakeholder group together to understand why customers don’t participate in programs and determine the best way to reduce barriers and communicate.
To that end, she said NorthWestern is evaluating significant customer research that’s “hot off the press” and includes national data as well as information from its own customers.
After reviewing the research, Schroeppel said, the utility will talk to the stakeholder group, start “strategizing around (the PSC’s) objectives,” and likely hire a consultant to “further facilitate the stakeholder group” and look at data to understand what needs to change.
Harbine wanted to know if the group had produced any recommendations based on the PSC order.
Schroeppel said the group is at that point right now, saying it has “a whole host of recommendations,” including, for example, to allow “categorical eligibility.” That would mean a customer could be automatically eligible for utility assistance if the person already qualifies for, say, Medicaid.
Harbine wanted to know if the group would make a proposal that addressed the PSC’s order before its next rate case, but Schroeppel said she anticipated it would issue findings and an update instead.
“The proposal would come more along the lines if we were going to come in and ask to change something,” Schroeppel said.
“And you don’t anticipate asking to change something?” Harbine said.
Schroeppel said NorthWestern does not anticipate changing anything yet because it needs to do more work around analytics and the cost of different ideas.
“I think some of the barriers can probably be just worked on between the various agencies and the stakeholder group,” Schroeppel said.
Harbine wanted to know if Schroeppel believed NorthWestern was committing enough resources to address affordability concerns, and Schroeppel said she does.
But Schroeppel said the consultant will help, and she anticipates that work will extend “beyond the scope of what this initial commission order was” and look at “future programs,” including ideas from other utilities.
The hearing is expected to continue through June 20.

Chris Brown, R-Kansas City, speaks Wednesday in favor of the bill he handled that would finance new or improved professional sports stadiums in Kansas City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri House closed the special legislative session Wednesday with votes to finance professional sports stadiums in Kansas City and provide tornado relief for St. Louis.
Three special session bills, already approved in the state Senate, are now in the hands of Gov. Mike Kehoe. He is expected to sign them quickly, putting the decision on whether to stay in Missouri in the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals, who are also considering an offer from Kansas to cross the state line.
State Rep. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City handling the stadium bill, asked his colleagues to do what they would do to retain any large employer.
“We really need to, or should, look at these franchises, not just as entertainment,” Brown said. “They are entertaining, obviously, but it’s an incredibly big business.”
Opponents of the legislation said it improperly benefits wealthy team owners at the expense of other Missourians. They also contend the bill is unconstitutional.
“The middle class, everyday Missourian is expected to pay for this,” said state Rep. Richard West, a Republican from Wentzville. “We’ve been promising for years for some form of tax relief or tax adjustment or something to ease the burden on what they have, and this is exactly the opposite of what we promised them to come up here to do.”
The measure to finance new stadiums was the most controversial of the three bills, passing on a 90-58 vote, with 32 Democrats joining with 58 Republicans to provide the majority. There were 13 Democrats and 45 Republicans who voted against the bill.
To finance the stadium construction, the bill sets aside tax revenue generated by the teams and economic activity at Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums. Estimated at just under $1.5 billion over 30 years, the funding would pay for half the costs of improvements at Arrowhead and a new home for the Royals.
The Kansas offer would cover 70% of the construction costs for new stadiums, but it expires at the end of the month. The bill passed Wednesday requires financing from local governments, either in Jackson County, where the teams currently reside, or Clay County, which is trying to lure the Royals.
It is impossible to put a ballot measure before voters in the time remaining for the Kansas offer. House leaders from the Kansas City area had differing views on whether the teams should accept or reject Missouri’s offer now that it is a firm commitment but without knowing what voters will approve in the Kansas City region.
“I don’t know what the teams will do,” said House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican. “They have their own plan. I think that’s very unlikely, but I’m just worried about the things I can control, and teams are on their own schedule and will act accordingly.”
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, said the teams should make a decision before June 30
“I would call on them to do so,” Aune said. “We bent over backwards here in the Missouri legislature to deliver them something by the end of their imposed deadline of June 30. And I would very much like for them to hold true to that deadline and let us know where they’re going before that.”
Chiefs owner Clark Hunt issued a statement thanking the legislature but made no commitment.
“The passing of this legislation is an important piece of the overall effort,” Hunt said. “While there’s still work to be done, this legislation enables the Chiefs to continue exploring potential options to consider remaining in Missouri.”
Patterson and Aune also disagreed on whether the extra disaster aid and property tax controls Kehoe added to the special session agenda had made the difference between success and failure on the stadium bill.
Patterson said each bill was considered on its own merits and that the property tax provisions may have cost votes. The stadium legislation won 103 votes in the House in May but the bill died in the state Senate.
“I’d like to think that people took a look at both those things on their own,” Patterson said. “I don’t think anybody here voted for one thing just because of the other.”
The House voted down two amendments so the bill did not require another vote in the state Senate. Patterson said it would have failed the second time around.
“A second Senate vote on the (stadium bill) would have been impossible, just the political climate after that vote,” Patterson said. “So we were very mindful of that. I thought if it goes back, it’s not going to pass.”
Aune said the additional disaster aid was essential to securing Democratic votes.
“If he wanted to get this stadium done, which is an economic development opportunity for the state and a priority of our governor, it was necessary to make sure that he could shore up those votes by making folks happy in other ways,” Aune said.
  State Rep. Kimberly-Ann Collins, D-St. Louis, speaks Wednesday on the devastation her district has suffered after a tornado hit the area on May 16 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
 Disaster relief

During debate on the special session spending bill, the House fell silent as state Rep. Kimberly-Ann Collins, a St. Louis Democrat, described the devastation of her north St. Louis legislative district.
Collins was home on May 16 because the General Assembly adjourned early instead of working to the final day allowed by the Missouri Constitution. She was in her car, preparing to attend a high school graduation when the tornado hit, she said.
“I watched a tornado rip through the middle of my house district,” Collins said. “I also watched it rip off my roof, and I watched the tornado rip off my neighbor’s roof. To this day, debris still sits in my front yard, and I’m a girl that has no insurance.”
Four of the five Missourians who died in the tornado lived in her district, Collins said.
The disaster relief provisions in the legislation address both the devastation of the May 16 tornado in St. Louis and the damages suffered by other Missourians in storms and flooding earlier in the year. They are:

$100 million in the spending bill for storm recovery in the city of St. Louis;
$25 million for home repairs and other housing needs through programs of the Missouri Housing Development Commission, available in any county included in a request for federal disaster aid;
A tax credit worth up to $5,000 for insurance deductibles paid for residential damage in an area included in a request for federal disaster aid. The legislation would allow $90 million in claims this year and $45 million per year for future years. 

The provisions were demanded before the Senate vote because of uncertainty about the federal response to the tornado. Kehoe asked President Donald Trump for a federal disaster declaration for the tornado on May 25 and for April 29 storms in Scott on May 19. 
Trump approved both late Monday, making federal aid for emergency housing and rebuilding available to individuals and providing money to reimburse the state and local governments for recovery costs.
State Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Democrat from Ferguson who is in her last term in the House, asked her colleagues to stand by St. Louis for the long-term.
“For those of us who will be termed-out next year,” Proudie said, “we need the rest of you who will be here five years later to continue to remember this day, to remember this time, to remember these last three weeks, to continue to pour help into these communities, into these people.”
  State Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, D-Columbia, speaks on the House floor Wednesday about how property tax provisions in the stadium funding bill affects local schools (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
 Constitutional questions

The property tax cap in the stadium bill will be imposed in 97 counties. There would be 75 counties where basic tax bills would not increase more than 5% per year and 22 where no increase would be allowed.
The list excludes most of the largest counties of the state and many members opposed it because the Missouri Constitution requires property taxes to be “uniform upon the same class or subclass of subjects.”
Another constitutional objection was raised that the bill improperly aids a private entity by giving state support to the Chiefs and Royals, in violation of a provision added to the Constitution in 1875. 
“I haven’t heard an argument yet that this bill is going to be upheld,” said state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon. “I’ve only heard arguments that we should ignore the fact that it’s unconstitutional.”
The likelihood of the property tax provisions being blocked by the courts led at least one Democrat to vote for the bill. State Rep. Kathy Steinmetz of Columbia, speaking at a news conference after the vote, said she sees the cap as shifting the tax burden for schools to state taxpayers.
“They’re ending up paying more,” she said, “so that we can help the school districts that are not putting forth that local tax effort.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The state is investigating another death in Department of Corrections custody.
Nicholas Skorka, 42, died at the South Dakota State Penitentiary on Tuesday, according to a press release. 
The release did not list a cause of death for Skorka. He is the 10th person to die in the department’s custody this year and the fourth that will be subject to scrutiny by the state Division of Criminal Investigation, the investigative arm of the Attorney General’s Office. 
10 injured in prison violence days after protests over security and inmate treatment

The death certificate for one of the investigated cases, that of 20-year-old Anthony Richards, lists the cause of his February death as an overdose of “synthetic cannabinoid 5F-ADB,” a drug sometimes referred to as K2. Two other inmates, 39-year-old Jason Garreau and 24-year-old Joshua Arrow, died days apart late last month. Arrow’s official death certificate has yet to be filed; Garreau’s was filed last week and lists methamphetamine toxicity” as his cause of death.
Wednesday’s release did not say if Skorka’s death is being investigated as drug-related. An autopsy for Skorka, whose body was found in his cell, will take place Thursday.
“DCI will do a thorough investigation, and we will determine what additional action is needed pending the results of that investigation,” Attorney General Marty Jackley said in the release.
On May 29, Department of Corrections spokesman Michael Winder sent a notice saying the department had busted a drug ring at the penitentiary. Its staff seized shipments of drugs intended for delivery to Sioux Falls inmates via the mail and parcels delivered by visitors to inmates.
“If the results of the investigation warrant prosecution,” that day’s news release said, “criminal charges will be sought.”
Jackley’s spokesman Tony Mangan told South Dakota Searchlight on Wednesday that no charges have been filed for actions tied to the drug ring or in-custody deaths.

Reynolds said in a veto letter she line-item vetoed a $1.5 million appropriation to UNI to provide in-state tuition for students coming from states bordering Iowa not because she doesn’t support the program, but because of how it was being implemented.

UNI originally requested $3 million for the tuition change, Reynolds said in the letter, a one-time allocation to launch the program before it became self-sustaining, but the legislation would provide $1.5 million in the upcoming fiscal year “with an expectation of ongoing funding.”
Questions also remained about how the program could impact current students who fall under this category, Reynolds said in the letter.
UNI President Mark Nook told lawmakers this spring lowering tuition for students from contiguous states would help bring more of them to Iowa, where they would likely stay after graduation.
“I look forward to working with UNI next year to further develop the details of the program and see it launched,” Reynolds said in the letter.

The federal Permitting Council recently listed three uranium projects in New Mexico as projects it is seeking to streamline. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)A federal council recently placed two proposed uranium mines in New Mexico on a select list of mining projects nationwide to receive streamlined federal permitting consideration, a designation the project’s owner says results from President Donald Trump’s push to accelerate nuclear energy production.
The Jara Mesa and Crownpoint-Churchrock mine projects are now two of six mining projects nationwide to get what’s known as the “FAST-41” designation, established under the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act. 
The designation means the projects will receive  “focused, hands-on permitting support” that aims to improve coordination and efficiency among federal agencies, according to the federal Permitting Council. The council notes, however, the designation doesn’t change any law or regulation, environmental or otherwise, required for federal permitting. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

As a result of the change, three of six mining projects nationwide to receive the designation are in New Mexico, as the Grants Precision project was added in early May.  The other three projects on the list are in Arizona, California and Colorado. 
The permitting website shows both projects were added to the list May 30, and, last week, Laramide Resources, the company trying to build the mine in McKinley County, touted the mines’ inclusion as part of Trump’s domestic energy agenda.
“As momentum builds around a new era for nuclear power, it is important to recognize that uranium is the fundamental starting point of the entire fuel cycle,” Laramide CEO Marc Henderson said in a June 2 news release. 
The statement cited a May 23 Trump executive order supporting the acceleration of nuclear development in the United States. 
In addition to the FAST-41 designation, the Jara Mesa is one of two proposed uranium in the Mount Taylor Ranger District of the Cibola National Forest that forest leaders have deemed “priority projects,” as Source New Mexico reported in March. 
The Jara Mesa mine’s proximity to Mount Taylor, a sacred mountain to the Navajo Nation and several pueblos in New Mexico, is one reason anti-nuclear opponents have forcefully pushed back against the mine for more than a decade. They also cite the legacy of the uranium mining industry in New Mexico, which has left decades of radioactive and cancer-causing waste in its wake.

In addition to the Jara Mesa Mine, the Crownpoint-Church Rock mine was also added to the FAST-41 list in late May. Laramide Resources touted the project as “one of the largest undeveloped uranium deposits in the U.S.,” which “has the potential to play a central role in securing a domestic supply of this critical mineral.”
A regulator with the state’s Mining and Minerals Division recently told Source New Mexico that, even though the federal government is seeking to streamline its approval of the uranium projects, the state will take its time for a review. He also said no project can legally move forward without a state permit, even though the mines lie largely on federal land.
An environmental lawyer in New Mexico also told Source that the Trump administration’s efforts to gut federal environmental impact reviews is likely illegal and would be subject to litigation if he tried to cut them in New Mexico. 
The Laramide statement says while the FAST-41 designation helps its goal of breaking ground in what would be the first new uranium mine in New Mexico in more than 50 years, “continued policy support will be essential to overcome the longstanding regulatory and permitting challenges that have constrained U.S. uranium production.”
Trump’s push for Southwest uranium will face stiff state review

The other uranium mine proposal near Mount Taylor, known as Roca Honda, does not appear on the FAST-41 list. But it is on a list of “transparency” projects, one of about 20 selected by the federal Permitting Council to improve the public’s understanding of how the projects are progressing.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As the nation continues to watch protests happening in Los Angeles — with more demonstrations planned across the U.S. — a top Utah Democrat criticized President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard members to California over objections from Gov. Gavin Newsom. 
“Over the past few days, we have witnessed federal agents conducting large-scale workplace raids across Los Angeles,” House Minority Leader Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City, — who is also Latina — said in a prepared statement Wednesday. 
“These actions, along with President Trump’s deployment of thousands of National Guard members, represent both an abuse of power and an escalation of fear within our immigrant communities,” she said. 
Romero’s comments come the day after Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said he was “grateful” for Trump’s move to intervene. He also issued a warning that Utah would be “overprepared” to quickly respond to any protests here that turn violent or destructive. 
With eye on LA protests, Gov. Cox warns Utah will be ‘overprepared,’ won’t tolerate violence

Cox and members of Utah’s Republican supermajority Legislature have defended the Trump administration’s efforts to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally. 
Romero, while saying she agrees the focus should be on those with criminal records, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have gone too far. 
“I agree with my colleagues across the aisle that undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records should be held accountable,” she said. “However, raiding elementary schools, separating families, and targeting hardworking individuals does nothing to achieve that goal.”
Romero added that she will “not stand by as the president of the United States instills fear, disappears individuals, and escalates peaceful protests with tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs.” 
Romero agreed that “violence, destruction and vandalism are unacceptable,” but she argued it’s up to California’s leaders to act — not Trump.
“While the vast majority of protestors have remained peaceful, those engaging in criminal behavior must be held accountable,” she said, adding: “That said, it is the responsibility of Los Angeles law enforcement and California’s elected officials to manage these situations — not President Trump.”
Romero said aggressive actions will only deepen divides between Americans.
“These actions are not collaborative,” she said. “They are theatrical displays of power that only inflame tensions.”
After four straight days of escalating protests, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on Tuesday issued a curfew on most of downtown Los Angeles. She said it was necessary to curb the actions of “bad actors who do not support the immigrant community,” the L.A. Times reported.

Such fires have grown more prevalent with climate change. (Photo by Getty Images) Medical experts are dismayed over a federal report’s claim that kids are overprescribed asthma medications, saying it minimizes how many lives the drugs save.
Safe treatment protocols for asthma management have been carefully studied over the years, said Dr. Perry Sheffield, a pediatrician and professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
“The federal government actually has some really beautiful and clear guidelines and strategies, and things that are vetted by and carefully edited by many experts in the field,” said Sheffield, who co-directs a region of the federally funded Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units that serves New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment that would dissuade insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”
The commission’s claims
The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.
In an emailed statement to Stateline, Health and Human Services press secretary Emily Hilliard wrote: “The MAHA report discusses concerns about the potential overprescription of asthma medications—particularly in mild cases—not to question their importance, but to encourage evidence-based prescribing.”
When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.
The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber  told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.


The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that’s a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor


Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”
Increased use
An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatric allergist and immunologist and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

,Mississippi Today,2025-06-11 21:44:29+00:00,Mississippi Today,Medgar Evers’ family fights efforts to strip his name from Navy vessel,Lili Euzet and Jerry Mitchell,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/11/medgar-evers-family-fights-efforts-to-strip-his-name-from-navy-vessel/,Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wants to rebrand Navy vessels christened for activists in an offensive against “wokeness” and DEI in the military.,"A week after Pentagon leaders announced their intention to possibly rename the USNS Medgar Evers, christened for  the World War II veteran and civil rights leader, his family urged the Department of Defense and the Navy to reverse their position.
The ship is one of eight vessels named after activists – among them Cesar Chavez, Harvey Milk, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Harriet Tubman – that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wants to rebrand in a large offensive against “wokeness” and diversity, equity and inclusion in the military to reestablish the “warrior ethos.”
This could be the second time Evers’ name is erased. Although President Donald Trump called Medgar Evers a “great American hero” at the 2017 opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, his name was removed last March from a site on the Arlington National Cemetery Website, which featured a section honoring Black Americans who fought in the nation’s wars.
“Renaming the USNS Medgar Evers is not only malicious — it is despicable,” said Evers’ daughter, Reena Evers-Everette. “As my mother said, ‘This is an injustice to a man who fought for his country both at home and abroad.’”
Evers was among the continuing wave of U.S. soldiers who arrived on the beaches of Normandy after the D-Day invasion in 1944. He enlisted in the U.S. Army at 17 and served in the Red Ball Express, a convoy run largely by African-American soldiers that transported equipment from Normandy beaches to Allied forces in inland France. He earned several military medals for his service.
After fighting the Nazis in World War II, he returned home to fight racism again in the form of Jim Crow, which barred Black Mississippians from restaurants, restrooms and voting booths.
In 1954, he became the Mississippi NAACP’s first field secretary and played a major part in the development of the organization. He led protests and boycotts for voting rights and desegregation of public schools, parks and Mississippi beaches. A target of white supremacists in Mississippi, he was murdered in 1963 by a member of the segregationist White Citizen’s Council and Ku Klux Klan.
In 2009, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus – a former Mississippi governor – announced the naming of a dry cargo ship after Evers. On Nov. 12, 2011, the USNS Medgar Evers was christened by Evers’ widow, Myrlie Evers.
“I will not have to go to bed again wondering whether anyone will remember who Medgar Evers is,” she said at the ceremony.
Mabus said he named the ship after Evers because the Lewis and Clark ships are named for pioneers and explorers, “those who have pushed past boundaries, and Medgar Evers was just such a civil rights pioneer.”
He opposes any renaming of the vessel. “Medgar Evers was an American hero who fought in Europe in World World and then came home to fight for the right to vote,” he said. “He is a hero in every sense of the word.”
Since its launch, the ship has traveled around the world and has taken part in NATO exercises.
On Thursday, the 62nd anniversary of Evers’ 1963 assassination, his family and friends laid a wreath at his former home, now a national monument.
Carolyn Cockrell Evers, the daughter of Medgar Evers’ brother, Charles, who took over as field secretary for the Mississippi NAACP after the assassination, recalled the family’s excitement at the christening ceremony.
She questioned why the Pentagon would want to spend millions to erase Evers’ name and others from Navy ships. While no estimates exist, a 2022 study by the Renaming Commission put the cost for renaming a single Army base at up to $8 million.
“We have bigger fish to fry than to spend the time and the money to make all of that happen,” she said.
Alveno N. Castilla, who serves on the Medgar & Myrlie Evers Institute, pointed out that besides erasing the legacy of a civil rights leader, the Pentagon would be stripping honors away from a military veteran who deserves recognition for his service.
Retired Master Sgt. of Investigations R.O. Williams, among the first three Black troopers in the Mississippi Highway Patrol, doesn’t understand the Pentagon’s push for these changes.
“It doesn’t make good sense,” he said. “A lot of stuff that’s happening does not make good sense.”
In a hearing Thursday, U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, decried the possible renaming of the Evers vessel.
“We’re in a situation where the military is denigrating Medgar Evers, who died standing up for the values that I think are central to our country,” he said. “Can we please just stop, and get back to the business of treating everybody equally and with respect?”
Evers-Everette said by attempting to remove the names of activists who fought with courage and honor for the citizens of their country, the Defense Secretary is sacrificing military values to a revisionist definition of patriotism.
“The USNS Medgar Evers was not named to make a political statement,” she said. “It was named to reflect a deeper truth: that freedom is not free — and some Americans have paid dearly for it.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)After President Donald Trump federalized National Guard troops against anti-ICE demonstrators in Los Angeles, Colorado Democratic leaders say the move is an overreach and would oppose similar actions in the state. 
Trump has ordered a detachment of 700 U.S. Marines and thousands of National Guard troops to deploy to L.A. over the objections of state and local leaders, the first such move by a U.S. president since 1965. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sued to block the deployments, which he said “crossed a red line.” Trump on Monday suggested Newsom, whom he did not accuse of any crime, should be arrested.
Shelby Wieman, spokesperson for Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, said Polis “has been clear” he would not support “federal overreach to activate the National Guard outside of regular order,” as the Colorado National Guard plays an important role in helping the state and others with natural disasters and emergencies as needed. 
“There is absolutely no need to take away National Guard units from the states, and any engagement with National Guard on this topic must include Governors, who serve as commanders in chief in most instances for their Guard,” Wieman said in a statement.

A spokesperson for the Colorado National Guard said Tuesday it “has not received an official request for support” from the federal government. 
The memorandum Trump issued authorizing the military escalation is not specific to Los Angeles or California, leaving open the potential for similar responses in other states. Elizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told NPR that the conditions that would ordinarily warrant military action are not present in this situation.
Colorado protests have grown since the escalations in L.A., with more than 1,000 people gathering outside the Colorado Capitol Tuesday night. Attendees began marching down two of the main roads around the Capitol and were met by a line of law enforcement officers after blocking traffic. Police arrested 17 people in relation to the demonstration. 
Denver Mayor Mike Johnston told Newsline that in his lifetime, Marines or National Guard troops have never been deployed into an American city without an “emphatic plea for help” from the city.
“America is built on the belief that we can ensure public safety and free speech. We don’t have to choose just one,” Johnston said in a statement. “This is not support. This is turning American soldiers on American citizens in service of Trump’s own political theatre. That decision disrespects the Marines and National Guard, disrespects American citizens, and disrespects the rule of law.”
In a post on X, U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Centennial Democrat and Army veteran, said federalizing the National Guard should always be a “last resort” when local law enforcement cannot alone handle a situation. He urged Trump to reverse course given that both the mayor of L.A. and Newsom made clear they did not need military support. 
“The reason for this is simple: introducing military personnel into domestic law enforcement situations is an escalation and can put both the military personnel and civilians on the ground at additional risk,” Crow said in the post.
Crow detailed in a separate thread on X that Trump’s deployment of the military in American communities is concerning because military personnel receive “very little training in law enforcement and domestic disturbance” as they are trained for “high-intensity combat operations.” He said Trump is trying to “intimidate Americans and suppress opposing views.”  
Trump’s executive order authorizing the use of “ANY personnel, in ANY location, for ANY length of time” is “a dangerous slippery slope” that should concern Americans everywhere, Crow said. 
“Sending military personnel with combat equipment and heavy weapons into tense domestic situations rarely deescalates. We have often seen deadly consequences and the erosion of public trust,” Crow said. “The servicemembers being mobilized signed up to protect Americans and their rights, not to be deployed against their fellow citizens.”
U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Windsor Republican and staunch Trump ally, has shown support for the military escalation in California online and criticized Democrats for “trash talking” military and law enforcement personnel. 
“If the feckless progressives in California won’t restore order, our U.S. Marines are more than up to the task,” she posted on X.

Phil Murphy speaking at a World Cup-related event in Liberty State Park on June 11, 2025. (Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office.)As anticipation builds for New Jersey hosting the World Cup next summer, anxieties are also swirling among international soccer fans worried they’ll be targeted by Trump administration immigration policies.
But Gov. Phil Murphy, who championed bringing FIFA’s soccer tournament to MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, said he’s not concerned about that and is optimistic it’ll be a “blowout success and a safe World Cup.”
“Based on all the vibrations I hear, and we hear a lot, we’re obviously working very closely with the administration, with FIFA — this is going to be done in a first-class, welcoming way,” Murphy said at a World Cup-related event at Liberty State Park in Jersey City Wednesday.
Next year’s World Cup will be the biggest in history, with 48 teams and three host countries — the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The tournament will take place from June 11 to July 19, with eight matches to be played at MetLife Stadium, including the final.
More than 1 million people are expected to travel from across the world to attend the matches. Camille Varlack, a deputy mayor to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, claims it will generate as much as $3.4 billion in economic revenue for the region. Varlack said up to 70% of that will benefit New York City, which is New Jersey’s host partner.
Alex Lasry, CEO of the host committee for New Jersey’s matches, urged tourists who may be worried to apply for a visa early and follow all the required steps. Lasry is focused on making sure everyone has a good time, he stressed.
“The world doesn’t stop for these sporting events, and you have to go with the flow and make sure you’re able to adapt, be a part of, and make sure that you’re able to put on a successful event, despite geopolitics,” he said.
Last month, Vice President J.D. Vance made an ominous warning to fans planning to visit for the most popular sporting event in the world.
“Of course everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event. I know we’ll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries. We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game,” he said. “But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home. Otherwise, they’ll have to talk to Secretary Noem,” referencing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. Noem oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Adding to some fans’ unease, President Donald Trump’s travel ban and visa restrictions on nearly two dozen countries — including Iran, which qualified for the tournament — also went into effect this week. Officials Wednesday said that doesn’t apply to athletes for the World Cup.
“I don’t want to speak for the president, but where it is today versus where it lands a year from today, a long road to travel between now and then,” Murphy said. “But anybody who qualifies, based on everything I know, is going to be welcomed whether their games are in the United States, Canada, or Mexico.”
Philadelphia host committee CEO Meg Kane appears more anxious about how Trump administration policies will affect the tournament, telling The Guardian that officials are “planning within uncertainty.”
“There are certainly things that are happening at the national level, the international level. There are going to be geopolitical issues that we don’t even know right now that are going to affect the tournament next year,” Kane told the outlet.
The focus of Wednesday’s event was to mark the one-year countdown to the first match. Liberty State Park will be transformed into an official “fan fest” site for watch parties for all 104 matches. Murphy noted that Major League Soccer, the professional league in the U.S. and Canada, was founded in response to the United States hosting the 1994 World Cup.
“I can only imagine what will be born out of this World Cup, and most importantly, in the communities in the region on both sides of the Hudson,” Murphy said.

""We've been been preparing for a number of scenarios, including this one, and we are well positioned to respond and maintain access to vaccines across the state,"" Goldstein said.
The post DPH chief: Mass. prepared to maintain vaccine access appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE STATE public health chief called the firing of all 17 members of a federal vaccine advisory panel “troubling” on Wednesday, while acknowledging that Massachusetts officials have been bracing for such a scenario. 
On Monday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. dismissed all members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, or ACIP. President Joe Biden’s administration had appointed all 17 members, including 13 in 2024, and “these appointments would have prevented the current administration from choosing a majority of the committee until 2028,” Kennedy’s office said. 
“In dismissing the members, the secretary stated his intention to repopulate the committee and to hold the scheduled ACIP meeting June 25 to June 27,” Public Health Commissioner Robbie Goldstein said. “This news is troubling. It amends a science-based process that has informed vaccine recommendations and promoted vaccine access for decades. The future of federal vaccine policy is unclear.” 
In a statement Monday, Kennedy said the move was “necessary to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science.” New members were not announced but Kennedy’s office said they will “ensure that government scientific activities are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.”
At a virtual state Public Health Council meeting Wednesday, Goldstein said it’s unclear if new ACIP members “will continue to use evidence and science to guide our vaccine recommendations and vaccine policy.”
“We’ve been been preparing for a number of scenarios, including this one, and we are well positioned to respond and maintain access to vaccines across the state,” Goldstein said. “Starting in November, we’ve been analyzing the legal and regulatory landscape, identifying resources that could be used to guide vaccine recommendations, strengthening our data systems to understand vaccine effectiveness, and building a coalition of like-minded, evidence-based public health organizations in this state and others.”
The Massachusetts Vaccine Purchasing Advisory Council, which helps distributes vaccines recommended by the ACIP, is slated to meet Thursday in Waltham. 
At a public hearing on Friday, Massachusetts parents and medical providers urged state lawmakers to scrap religious exemptions for school immunization requirements. The plea came amidst measles outbreaks in the US Meanwhile, vaccine opponents lamented potential state infringements on their faith and personal beliefs.
Students from preschool to college are required to receive a bevy of vaccines, including for polio, Hepatitis B, and measles, mumps and rubella, according to the state Department of Public Health.
State law allows students to seek medical and religious exemptions, and refiled bills from Rep. Andy Vargas and Sen. Edward Kennedy (H 2544 / S 1557) would eliminate the religious carveout for immunizations required in public, private and charter K-12 schools. Under the proposals, schools must submit data annually to DPH about how many students are vaccinated and how many received a medical exemption — with that information then made publicly available.
“Three of our Northeast neighbors — Connecticut, Maine and New York — have eliminated their non-medical vaccine exemptions in recent years,” Katie Blair, executive director of Massachusetts Families for Vaccines, told the Joint Committee on Public Health. “They have seen subsequent improvements in immunization rates, increasing the herd immunity protection that their most medically vulnerable residents depend upon. It’s time for Massachusetts to do the same.”
The committee reported the legislation out favorably at the end of last session on Dec. 16. Democrats in the Health Care Financing Committee did not advance the proposal.
The majority of vaccine exemptions are for religious reasons in Massachusetts, according to DPH. Some western and southeastern parts of the state, especially on the Cape and Islands, have higher rates of vaccine exemptions, and those areas “may be more susceptible to disease outbreaks because these students are not fully protected,” DPH says. 
Kyle Abrahamson, a biomedical engineer, said he opposed the bills because they encroach on his “free exercise of religion” and constitute “tyrannical overreach” from state government. Abrahamson argued that removing the religious exemption would force him to choose between his faith and his child’s education.
He also spoke against Sen. Becca Rausch’s so-called Community Immunity Act (S 1618) that would preserve religious vaccine exemptions but strengthen the exemption process and improve data reporting.
“Parents — not the state, nor any medical professional or anybody else — but parents are the paramount advocates for their own children,” Abrahamson said. “If H 2554, S 1557 and S 1618 move forward, the state is taking away parents’ faith and forcing parents to put their faith in them.”
Julie Booras, co-founder of Health Rights Massachusetts, said she “strongly” opposes all school-related vaccine bills before the committee. She testified in support of a Rep. John Gaskey bill (H 2431) that would block the state from requiring COVID-19 shots, mRNA vaccines or gene-altering procedures to enroll in K-12 schools, colleges or universities, as well as to enter private businesses or seek employment.
“This bill is critical to ensure the injustices of the COVID era can never happen again,” Booras said. “Despite all of the information now available about the physical, emotional and financial harms caused by the COVID countermeasures, nothing has changed. No meaningful action has been taken to rein in the sweeping powers granted to the governor and public health agencies by the Massachusetts Legislature.”
Vaccine supporters had emphasized new urgency over removing religious exemptions as they invoked the worsening measles outbreak in Texas and other hotspots. Texas has logged 744 measles cases since January, causing 96 people to be hospitalized and two deaths among school-aged children, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.
There were 1,168 confirmed measles cases and three confirmed deaths across the US as of June 5, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Massachusetts has not recorded any cases.
“Measles is an awful disease with dangerous complications and side effects,” Dr. Richard Moriarty, a retired pediatric infectious disease specialist, said. “With cuts in health care funding, how are we going to pay if there are outbreaks? Outbreaks are very expensive.”
Moriarty did not specify the funding cuts, but the Trump administration has moved to slash billions of dollars in public health grants and congressional Republicans are advancing proposals to drastically cut Medicaid dollars to states.
“Measles is so infectious, we need 95% of a population immunized to prevent an outbreak,” Moriarty continued. “We thought our schools were good in Massachusetts, but if you take a deep dive into them, 119 kindergartens have MMR rates less than 90%, 31 schools are below 80% in Massachusetts, 19% of our schools didn’t even bother to report their immunization rates this year, and 24% report their rates only on rolling three-year averages.”
Supporters emphasized that vaccine skepticism and misinformation is more common across the country, and the landscape is also marked by shifting federal vaccine recommendations and immunization schedules.  
“My colleagues are spending so much time just re-educating parents who have trusted the medical system for years and now have been instilled with this fear, which is completely based on misinformation,” said Dr. Christina Hermos, division chief of infectious disease at UMass Memorial Children’s Medical Center. “The frontline pediatricians are burning out having these conversations. We’re already having a crisis of people going into primary care across this nation.”
Kennedy last month announced the CDC is no longer recommending COVID vaccines for healthy children and pregnant individuals.
Goldstein on Wednesday said that COVID vaccines remain available. He stressed that vaccinating pregnant women can protect newborn babies who cannot get immunized yet. 
“I want to be clear: We know that COVID vaccination prevents severe illness, hospitalization and death in those at risk, which includes children and pregnant people,” Goldstein said. “DPH will continue to lift up the data and the evidence that are available to inform our recommendations. And we’ll work with insurers, health care providers and others across the state to maintain access to evidence-based safe vaccines.”

Current chair Liz Walters announced last month she will step down from the role no later than June 30. Walters, who was appointed chair in 2021, will be the new CEO of TargetSmart, a Washington, D.C.-based Democratic political data analysis firm. She was the first woman to be Ohio Democratic Party chair. 
Former U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown endorsed Clyde for party chair. Brown lost to Republican Bernie Moreno in the 2024 election. Brown has yet to announce if he is running for office in 2026. 
Clyde served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 2011 to 2018. She ran for Ohio Secretary of State in 2018, but lost to Republican Frank LaRose. In December 2018, she was appointed to the Portage County Commission. She ran for a full term as commissioner in 2020 but was defeated by Republican Tony Badalamenti.
Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, and Greene County Democratic Party Chair Kim McCarthy both dropped out of the race to be state party chair last week. 
Ohio Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Brunner is the only Democrat currently holding any statewide office in Ohio. Republican incumbent Ohio Supreme Court Justice Patrick Fischler is challenging Brunner for her seat in 2026, unable to pursue another term in his own seat due to age restrictions. Republicans currently control the state high court 6-1.
All four statewide executive offices of governor, attorney general, auditor, and secretary of state are up for open election in 2026, with all of the current Republican incumbents term-limited out of running for the same positions again.
Former Ohio Health Department Director Dr. Amy Acton is currently the only Democratic candidate running for Ohio governor. Republican candidates include businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and former Morgan County school board president Heather Hill.
Current Republican Ohio Auditor Keith Faber is running for attorney general in 2026; current Republican Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague is running for secretary of state in 2026; and current Republican Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose is running for auditor in 2026.
Current Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost had been running for governor, but recently dropped out of the race after the Ohio Republican Party endorsed Ramaswamy.
Bryan Hambley, a cancer doctor with University of Cincinnati Health, is the only announced Democratic candidate for Ohio Secretary of State. No other Democrats have yet announced their candidacy in 2026 for Ohio auditor, treasurer, or attorney general.
Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, announced last week she is stepping down from her leadership role at the end of the month, but she has not said whether she will seek a statewide office.
The last time any Democratic candidates won any of Ohio’s statewide executive offices was in 2006, when Ted Strickland was elected governor, Marc Dann was elected attorney general, Rich Cordray was elected treasurer, and Jennifer Brunner was elected secretary of state. They were all swept out of office in the 2010 cycle.
Also in 2006, Democrat Sherrod Brown was elected to his first of three terms in the U.S. Senate, defeating then-incumbent U.S. Senator and now-incumbent Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, before being defeated himself in 2024.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Motorists were already facing a penny increase in the tax they pay for every gallon of gasoline on July 1, 2025. But now they face the possibility of paying more in order to cut the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) looming budget deficit.
Under the House of Representative’s version of the fiscal 2026 budget released late Tuesday night, the state’s gas tax — now slated to rise from 37 cents per gallon to 38 cents on July 1 — would rise by another two cents to 40 cents, with that bump directed toward the RIPTA. The move would generate $8.7 million for the cash-strapped agency according to a summary of the proposed House budget.
The House’s budget also ups RIPTA’s share of Highway Maintenance Account funding by $5.9 million, plugging the agency’s budget gap by nearly $15 million. Revenue for the fund comes from vehicle registration fees.
The total of $14.6 million helps to plug a $32.6 million deficit the agency faced in the governor’s budget released in January. RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand expressed gratitude to House lawmakers for recognizing the urgent need to find more revenue for the agency in a statement Wednesday.
“The agency has long needed a consistent funding stream to allow us to better support getting Rhode Islanders to work, school and healthcare,” Durand said. “The last time the agency saw a permanent change in its funding structure was over ten years ago.”
But the remaining $18 million gap could mean RIPTA may have to lay off drivers and reduce or eliminate bus routes. Durand said the agency’s staff is still analyzing the full impact that the new budget gap could have on RIPTA’s services.
Rhode Island’s gas tax is the highest among New England states, according to January 2025 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Motorists who buy gas in Vermont now pay 32 cents per gallon while the tax is 30 cents in Maine, 27 cents in Massachusetts, 25 cents in Connecticut and 24 cents in New Hampshire.
But there are no complaints about the increased tax from AAA Northeast, which puts out weekly updates on the average cost of gas in Rhode Island. As of Monday, Rhode Island drivers paid an average of $2.97 per gallon.
“AAA Northeast generally supports gas taxes that help fund and improve broader transportation infrastructure, from roads and bridges to mass transit,” spokesperson Mark Schieldrop said in an emailed statement. “Funding for public transportation can lead to increased use and ultimately, less traffic congestion for drivers.”
The gas tax on every gallon of motor fuel purchased in Rhode Island is adjusted every two years based on inflation to comply with a 2014 law.
Service cuts appear ‘inevitable’
John Flaherty, a senior adviser for GrowSmart RI, called the nearly $15 million revenue infusion “a step in the right direction,” but still worries it’s not enough to keep RIPTA’s operations at existing levels.
“Until we commit to building a system that’s going to work for more people in this state, we’re going to continue to deal with this issue,” Flaherty said in an interview. “It seems inevitable that there will be some service cuts.”
Providence Streets Coalition Board President Liza Burkin estimates RIPTA could see 160 layoffs and significant service cuts, including paratransit service for riders with disabilities. But House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi told reporters Tuesday night that the paratransit program will remain untouched and that he did not see other service cuts as inevitable.
Shekarchi pointed to an overdue efficiency study lawmakers mandated in the fiscal 2025 budget as a way the agency can save costs on staff, operations and equipment.
“I think they need to look at everything,” Shekarchi said.

RIPTA’s board of directors commissioned WSP to do the efficiency study on March 27 at a cost of $412,346. The study is being completed in three phases. An initial 19-page memo from Canadian-headquartered engineering consulting firm WSP was thin on details in comparing RIPTA with five peer agencies across the country. It did point to an agency’s pursuit of “universal access agreements,” defined as partnerships where employers pay an annual fee to cover their workers’ fares to commute.
RIPTA entered such an agreement with Amazon and through partially subsidized fares for Omni Providence Hotel employees.
In a 20-page draft report issued May 30, WSP recommended investing in routes that are already high performing, potentially eliminating underperforming routes, and expanding commuter programs.
Low scoring routes in the report include the 88 bus, which travels in the morning and afternoon from Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
But transit advocates want all routes to be maintained, arguing that low ridership routes often provide a vital service for the state’s most vulnerable residents. They add that RIPTA is already an efficient agency. 
“I have no confidence that another efficiency study is going to reveal some big savings that’s going to enable us to get on with building a system that gets more people where they’re going in a reasonable amount of time,” Flaherty said.
Zack Mezera, Rhode Island organizer for the Working Families Party, expressed concern that lawmakers chose to raise the gas tax instead of enacting a higher income tax on Rhode Islanders earning over $625,000 a year.
“Throughout this session, Rhode Islanders have been at the State House week after week, imploring state leaders to increase revenue by having the 1% pay their fair share this year, because we can’t afford to let the losses pile up,” Mezera said.
The House released its proposed budget on the same evening the Rhode Island Senate unanimously confirmed Bernard Georges to join RIPTA’s board of directors. Georges told Rhode Island Current he was aware of the agency’s financial woes, but still needs to get up to speed.
“I need to give myself a full insight about the operations of the organization,” he said. 
Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., the chair of RIPTA’s board of directors, said the eight-member panel will be meeting on how the agency can move forward on whatever final budget is provided.
“As the Speaker said, our decisions will be informed by the efficiency study,” Alviti said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.

(Pedro Vilela | Getty Images)West Virginia school officials will instruct public schools to follow the state’s existing vaccine laws, going against an existing executive order from Gov. Patrick Morrisey that students be exempted from the requirements based on their religious beliefs about the shots. 
At its regular meeting Wednesday, the state Board of Education signed off on directing Superintendent Michele Blatt to issue the vaccine mandate guidance to county school boards.
West Virginia state law allows only medical exemptions to school-required vaccines, making the policy one of the strongest in the country. Morrisey issued an executive order earlier this year requiring the state to allow religious exemptions.
Speaking at the school board meeting, Sean Whelan, Morrisey’s general counsel, told the school board there’s been a misunderstanding about the basis of Morrisey’s executive order. The governor isn’t second guessing science or defying a law passed by the Legislature, he said. 
“Instead, he is reading that vaccine law together with another law, the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023, which prohibits government action that substantially burdens a person’s exercise of religion unless it serves a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of achieving that interest,” he said. “That language mirrors the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which federal courts across the country have described as a super statute, displacing the normal operation of otherwise applicable federal laws.”
The executive order applies only to the state health officials under Morrisey’s purview, and the governor is not ordering the Board of Education or county school boards to do anything, Whelan said. 
“But he is asking for your partnership and support in applying the Equal Protection for Religion. Act that has been on the books since 2023 and until he came into office, wasn’t applied,” Whelan said. “That law should be applied as written, and when it is, it requires the religious exemptions to compulsory vaccination that the health department provides.”
State lawmakers this year did not pass Senate Bill 460, which would have made the religious exemptions part of state law. Despite the bill not passing, Morrisey’s executive order stands. The state Department of Health had approved approximately 300 religious exemptions as of late last month. 
The difference between the governor’s order and state law has led to a fractured response from schools. Blatt issued a memo May 2 to county superintendents recommending that students not be allowed to attend schools next year without the required vaccinations but rescinded the guidance before the end of the day at the governor’s request.
Some private and religious schools opted not to follow the governor’s order.
Last month the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and legal advocacy organization Mountain State Justice filed a lawsuit asking the Kanawha County Circuit to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order. 
In a statement Wednesday, Morrisey spokesman Alex Lanfranconi said the school board is “trampling on the religious liberties of children, ignoring the state’s religious freedom law, and trying to make the state an extreme outlier on vaccine policy when there isn’t a valid public policy reason to do so. This decision isn’t about public health — it’s about making West Virginia more like liberal states such as California and New York,” he said.  
The Department of Health will continue to grant religious exemptions, he said.

Lawrence McClure (L). (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida could be poised to make it easier for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities (IDD) to maintain their Medicaid services.
The latest round of budget negotiations between the House and Senate includes a proposal by the House to eliminate a requirement for people with IDD to annually be redetermined eligible for the health care safety net program for the poor, elderly, and disabled. 
If approved once, they would be presumptively eligible the rest of their lives unless they no longer qualify for Medicaid or their condition changes.
The proposal, if accepted by the Florida Senate, would require approval from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to take effect.
“I’d call it a game changer for our population,” Florida Developmental Disabilities Council Executive Director Valerie Breen told the Florida Phoenix Wednesday. The council aims to increase the capacity of individuals with IDD to be included in their communities.
The House health care budget conferees made the offer Tuesday. As of this publication, the budget negotiators had not met again.

Breen said people with these disabilities face difficulties when they have to be re-determined Medicaid-eligible. She said people with IDD erroneously fell off the Medicaid rolls when, following the end of the public health emergency associated with Covid 19, people had to requalify for Medicaid.  Breen guessed that as many as 1,000 people with IDD who were eligible for Medicaid erroneously lost their coverage.
For people with IDD the redetermination process requires the Department of Children and Families (DCF), which determines eligibility, to communicate with the state Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), which administers the Medicaid program, and the Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD), which is charged with oversight of programs that serve these populations. Sometimes, Breen said, redetermination also included interaction with the Social Security Administration. 
“Those were the critical components, and the agencies did not communicate with each other,” she said. 
As a result people with IDD lost access to the home and community-based services that help them with the activities of daily living like eating and grooming.
“They were not able to access any of those services,” Breen said.
The Legislature was forced to extend the 2025 Session after legislative leadership couldn’t reach an agreement on how much state money to spend in state fiscal year 2025-26, which begins July 1, and how much tax relief to provide residents. 
House Speaker Daniel Perez and Senate President Ben Albritton ultimately agreed to extend the session until June 16 and to spend about $50 billion in general revenue, or state tax dollars, across various government agencies.
 Most of the money will go to two areas: education and health care, with the former receiving more than $22 billion and the latter about $17.5 billion. 
Budget negotiators have been meeting to try to hammer out the details of how the money should be spent.  
The state budget must be printed and distributed to legislators by June 15 in order to vote on it by June 18. That’s because of a constitutional provision that requires the budget to cool off for 72 hours before legislators can vote on it.
New law brings managed care to people with intellectual disabilities

The move to allow people with IDD to remain on Medicaid after initially being determined eligible is one of several proposals relating to people with IDD that are being championed by the House. Perez vowed to make those issues a priority during his two year tenure.
To that end, Perez championed HB 1103, a proposal to make a small managed care pilot program, available statewide for people with IDD. HB 1103 also requires APD to publicly publish reports regarding the number of people with IDD the state serves and the number of people on a wait list for the Medicaid services. Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed the legislation.

Technicians typically work at least 65 hours a week, the lawsuit claims.

Photo by Wilson Ring/AP
Consolidated Communications has been hit with a proposed collective and class action lawsuit alleging that the telecommunications giant does not give overtime pay to its technicians in Vermont and two other northern New England states in violation of state and federal laws. 
David Russell and John Orton III, two former Consolidated Communications technicians who worked for the company in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, made the allegations in a complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Burlington.
Consolidated Communications provides internet and telephone service to households and businesses throughout Vermont and across the U.S., often operating under the brand name Fidium Fiber. 
The company offers high-speed broadband internet access for over 130,000 Vermonters and is the state’s largest landline telecommunications provider.
According to the complaint, the company primarily pays its technicians on a “piece-rate” basis, meaning they are given a flat rate per specific task they complete, such as home internet setups and fiber optic cable installations. Technicians can also earn an hourly wage for certain repair work they complete. 
But even though technicians typically work at least 65 hours a week, the complaint claims, those flat and hourly rates are set “without accounting for overtime compensation at all” and do not go up once employees exceed a traditional 40-hour workweek. 
For the company’s wage practices in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, the lawsuit accuses the Consolidated Communications of violating the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the Vermont Employment Practices Act and the New Hampshire and Maine wage laws, all of which require employers to pay overtime wages at a rate of at least 1.5 times an employee’s regular wage.
While working with Consolidated Communications, the lawsuit claims, Russell and Orton earned no overtime wages despite working for 65 and 70 hours a week on average, respectively. The two men worked for Consolidated at various points between 2020 and 2024, a time period during which the company invested heavily to extend its fiber optic network in Vermont.
The lawsuit identifies one week in May 2023 in which Orton worked nearly 75 hours without any corresponding increase in his pay rate. Calculating Orton’s average wage for the pay period, the complaint claims that, based on the overtime rate required by federal and state law, the technician should have been given over $4,800 in overtime for that week alone. 
“Hard-working Technicians provide critical telecommunications services to Defendants’ customers throughout the Northeast. Yet, these Defendants have failed to pay them their earned overtime wages,” Stephen Ellis, a Burlington-based lawyer representing Russell and Orton, wrote in a statement. “No one should be denied their earned wages and we look forward to holding these Defendants accountable in court.”
A spokesperson for Consolidated Communications said the company could not comment on the ongoing lawsuit. 
State and federal laws exempt certain categories of employees from overtime pay requirements,  including some administrative roles and salespeople who earn commissions, as well as outside contractors. 
One question that the courts will likely have to tackle is whether technicians working for Consolidated Communications could theoretically fall under such an exemption. 
According to the complaint, Russell and Orton, as well as many other northern New England technicians for Consolidated Communications, were hired through a company called Conexa Technologies, which is named as a co-defendant. 
“Together,” the complaint says, “Defendants supervise and control all aspects of their employment of Technicians.”
The complaint asks the court to allow the lawsuit to move forward as both a class action and collective action case, meaning that other technicians employed by the company in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine could join the suit and collectively seek damages.
The lawsuit also asks the court to require Consolidated Communications to change its overtime wage policy and to give all technicians involved in the case their owed overtime wages plus interest.
According to the complaint, about 500 technicians could feasibly join the suit, potentially putting Consolidated Communications and Conexa on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.

(Photo by Shelby Kleinhans for Source NM)Management at a hospital in Rio Rancho violated workers’ labor rights by refusing to bargain over a series of layoffs in 2023, a state district court judge ruled this week.
Second Judicial District Court Judge Elaine Lujan issued a ruling on Tuesday upholding an earlier order by the state Public Employee Labor Relations Board, which found that the University of New Mexico Sandoval Regional Medical Center breached its legal duty to bargain with the union who represents workers there.
Through a prohibited practices complaint in May 2023, the United Health Professionals of New Mexico alleged the hospital had begun laying off more than a dozen workers.
That October, the Board’s hearing officer concluded that management broke the law by refusing to bargain over the layoffs, failing to respond to requests for information about the layoffs and implementing unilateral changes to some workers’ duties.
The Board in February 2024 adopted the hearing officer’s recommendations, and the hospital appealed the decision to Lujan, whose decision this week sided with PELRB.
“This ruling should shut the door on the hospital’s campaign to avoid bargaining in good faith and silence its workers,” UHPNM President and physical therapy Regina McGinnis said in a statement on Wednesday. “Its refusal to follow basic legal obligations under labor law is not only unethical but dangerous for workers and the patients they serve.”
UNM Health System Communications Director Chris Ramirez told Source NM on Wednesday that UNM Hospital respects the ruling.
“Since acquiring UNM Sandoval Regional Medical Center in 2024, UNM Hospital has bargained with and entered into collective bargaining agreements with two labor organizations, including most recently UHPNM,” Ramirez said in a statement. “UNM Hospital is committed to working with its labor partners to ensure that it fulfills its mandate to the community by providing high-quality patient care. UNM Hospital looks forward to continuing this dialogue with its labor partners.”
According to a news release, UHPNM is currently reviewing the Public Employee Labor Relations Board’s remedy “to determine whether the employer has complied or whether further legal action is required,” and noted ongoing “serious concerns” about the hospital’s compliance given its past behavior.
“This is a public hospital, funded by public dollars, and there must be public accountability,” McGinnis said. “Health care workers deserve more than empty apologies and legal delays. They deserve respect and a lawful seat at the table.”

For months now, Trump and his minions have been waging a campaign to twist the military into a heavily armed loyalist force.
The post Trump’s domestic deployment of US armed forces is an alarming abuse of power and affront to democracy   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ON SATURDAY, President Trump issued a memorandum authorizing a domestic deployment of the US armed forces. Although widely reported as an order to federalize National Guard troops to counter protests in California, the order is far broader, also authorizing the secretary of defense to use federal active-duty military forces.  
The order is not limited to California: it has no geographic restrictions and no expiration date. Since then, the president stated, “We’re gonna have troops everywhere,” and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth mobilized the US Marines.  
As a civil rights lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union and US military veteran, I know the president’s order is a significant abuse of power. It is an affront to the core principles of our democracy. And it is incumbent upon every American to call for this order to be rescinded immediately.  
The US military is a potent force for defense against external adversaries. The Defense Department commands more than one million uniformed personnel on active duty, and can potentially activate almost a million more from the Reserve and National Guard. Its units are equipped with the most powerful and sophisticated weapons, surveillance, and logistics technologies in the history of the world. They are backed by a budget of nearly $1 trillion per year and work within systems designed to promote and ensure efficiency and secrecy.   
But a force that exists for protection also has the potential to be a dangerous tool for internal repression. Authoritarian governments throughout history have blurred the lines between military power and civilian law enforcement. Once the door is open to military forces targeting some of the population, that door is very hard to close. When the rule of law becomes the rule of force, no one will be safe.   
Our nation’s founders understood these principles. The battles of Lexington and Concord were fought by the revolutionaries against a military occupation of their communities by their own sovereign. Military occupation was one of the founders’ listed grievances in the Declaration of Independence, an intolerable injustice perpetrated by the monarchy they rejected. The separation of military power from domestic law enforcement is a core American tradition.  
Deploying the tools of war inside our own country to suppress constitutionally protected expression and assembly is dangerous and un-American. Such actions would not only run counter to core constitutional principles but also offend the honorable service of the many uniformed Americans who still seek to protect rather than undermine our democratic values.   
Over time, lawmakers have created important legal restrictions to prevent presidents from deploying the military against civilians. One protection is the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which specifically forbids the use of the federal military as a domestic police force. There are certain exceptions to that prohibition — Congress permits deployment of uniformed troops on American soil in extreme emergencies. But there is no such emergency today.   
In California, ICE reportedly used aggressive military tactics to make arrests in restaurants and shopping centers, firing tear gas and other chemical agents against protesters, press, and bystanders present on the scene.  
Such actions can create a pretext for military deployment — and people have every reason to believe that Trump will use that deployment to intensify the aggressive tactics we saw in Los Angeles, in keeping with his administration’s broadly repressive agenda.  
For months now, Trump and his officials have been waging a campaign to twist the military into a heavily armed loyalist force. Since January 20, Trump has fired the only Black person and the only woman on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as the head of the National Security Agency, without any apparent explanation.  
Trump and his officials also fired without justification top military lawyers tasked with advising military leaders on compliance with the law. Secretary of Defense Hegseth then directly commissioned his own personal lawyer as a commander in the Navy and reportedly assigned him to overhaul the training of military lawyers. These actions by the president and secretary of defense are so extreme and dangerous that, even as early as February, the former secretary of the Air Force publicly declared the country to be entering “uncharted territory.”    
That is only more true today.  
California has now filed a lawsuit to block the president’s order. But political abuses also require political action.  
Bravery from public officials and private citizens is key to rejecting the deployment of our military against the people of our own country. That means public officials and employees need to speak out against this order. It means that legislators must assert their power to protect the public. And it means that every concerned citizen must exercise our constitutional rights to assemble and be heard. We must demand that the president’s order be rescinded now, before it is too late.

Free.,"Tanks, choppers descend on D.C. in prep for Army anniversary parade, Trump birthday",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tanks-choppers-descend-dc-prep-army-anniversary-parade-trump-birthday,,"WASHINGTON — More than 100 heavy-duty military vehicles and weapons systems will parade down Constitution Avenue in the nation’s capital Saturday, just days after President Donald Trump ordered troops to Los Angeles to quell mostly nonviolent protests against deportations.The display, on the date of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and Trump’s 79th birthday, will feature roughly 6,700 soldiers from every division, 150 vehicles, 50 aircraft, 34 horses, two mules and one dog, at a price tag in the tens of millions of dollars, according to the Army.The evening parade of Army vehicles and aircraft flyovers — plans for which came to light in early May — will occur as protests against the administration’s immigration raids spread through major U.S. cities.Trump ordered 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles Sunday after demonstrations opposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests erupted Friday, some turning violent over the weekend in downtown LA, a suburb and a portion of a freeway.Trump ordered another 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA Monday, despite numerous reports that protests remained peaceful.Saturday’s parade in D.C. has drawn criticism for the cost and optics, as Republicans on Capitol Hill seek ways to cut safety net programs, and as Trump deployed troops to LA, defying the state’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.Trump told reporters Tuesday in the Oval Office that any protests at the Army parade “will be met with very heavy force.”When pressed Wednesday by a reporter following up on Trump’s comment, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Of course the president supports peaceful protest. What a stupid question.”Mass “No Kings” protests organized by a coalition of liberal national groups and labor unions are planned across the United States Saturday, but deliberately not in D.C. Some actions from separate organizations are expected to crop up in the nation’s capital, though details are sparse.Army equipment stored in MarylandTanks and fighting vehicles were transported into the District of Columbia Tuesday night on flatbed trucks, as shown in video circulating online. The equipment rolled in over the weekend by rail from Texas and had been staged at the CSX rail yard in Jessup, Maryland, according to the Army.A festival to celebrate the Army’s founding in 1775 has been in the works for more than a year and will feature a wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery as well as a fitness competition, military equipment exhibits, food trucks and appearances by professional NFL players on the National Mall. But details of a parade only emerged in April and were confirmed in early May by The Associated Press.

According to a March 31 application obtained by WTOP News, America250.org applied for a permit for the parade along the National Mall, as well as nighttime fireworks and concert “featuring well known performers, likely from the country music world.” A press release for the event from America250, described as the “nonprofit supporting organization to the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission,” celebrates Trump and his role. “Under President Trump’s leadership, the U.S. Army has been restored to strength and readiness,” it says. “His America First agenda has delivered historic pay raises for service members, rebuilt military stockpiles, invested in cutting-edge technologies, and ensured our soldiers have the tools and support they need to win on any battlefield.” The pay raises were part of last year’s defense policy bill, before Trump’s presidency.The festival and the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million, according to Army spokesperson Heather Hagan, though the price tag for the parade alone was not specified. The Army did not respond to a question about where the funds originated.It is not the first time Trump has wanted a military parade. He had planned one in the nation’s capital in 2018 but it was called off due to the cost, NBC reported at the time.Big crowds and lots of fencingMatt McCool, of the U.S. Secret Service Washington field office, said for this parade, officials are expecting an “enormous turnout.” The agency is leading local, state and federal law enforcement during the National Special Security Event, the sixth for D.C. this year. They are nationally or internationally significant events expected to be attended by high-level officials and large numbers of people.Just over 18 miles of anti-scale fencing and 17 miles of “bike rack”-style fencing has been erected as a security perimeter surrounding the parade route. Members of the public wishing to see the parade will have to pass through one of the 175 metal detectors at three security checkpoints.McCool, special agent in charge of the Washington office, said the Secret Service has been planning security since April 22, “which is shorter than normal,” and that the agency is prepared for protests.“We are paying attention obviously to what is happening (in Los Angeles) and we’ll be ready for that if it were to occur here,” McCool said Monday during a press conference.Troops bunking in federal office buildingsThe parade will include troops from the National Guard and Army Reserve, Special Operations Command, United States Military Academy and Reserve Officer Training Corps, and it will feature period uniforms and equipment reflecting the Revolutionary War to the modern forces.Young enlistees sent to Washington to march in the parade toured the D.C. sites near the U.S. Capitol Wednesday.Not every state sent Guard members. But the New York National Guard will participate, and will house roughly 460 New York and Massachusetts National Guard soldiers in an empty Department of Agriculture office building and an unused General Services Administration warehouse until June 15, according to a press release.The troops were bused to Washington on Wednesday, and the trip cost — including meals ready-to-eat for breakfast and lunch, a hot dinner and a $69 per diem — will be covered by the Army.Golden Knights to give Trump a giftFlyovers will also occur during the parade featuring AH-64 Apaches, UH-60 Blackhawks and CH-47 Chinooks.The Army Golden Knights parachute team is expected to land on the White House South Lawn and present Trump with a folded flag, according to media reports. Trump is expected to deliver remarks, according to the America250 organization. The White House did not respond to questions about the day’s timeline.Among the vehicles and equipment rolling down Constitution Avenue between 15th and 23th streets will be Abrams tanks, first used in 1991 for Operation Desert Storm; High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, used to launch multiple rockets at precise aim from far distances; and 9,500-pound titanium M777 lightweight Howitzers that fire 105-pound shells up to 24 miles and are currently in use on Ukraine’s battlefields.The Army Corps of Engineers released footage of 18-by-16-foot metal plates installed on D.C. streets to reinforce the roads prior to the massive vehicles driving over them.D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said in early June that she “remains concerned” about damage to the city’s streets.“But I gotta think that the Army is among the most qualified logistics moving agencies in the world. They have moved equipment in more precarious situations, so we’re relying on their expertise. But what I can tell D.C. residents is that we will try to keep our road network usable, and if we have to fix something we will seek reimbursement from the Feds,” Bowser told reporters at a June 3 press conference.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)In a first-of-its-kind effort, the Texas legislature has passed a bill to require warning labels on foods such as Mountain Dew and white bread that contain certain artificial additives and dyes.
The measure, now awaiting action by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, would require a warning label prominently displayed on foods containing any of 44 artificial dyes and additives — a mandate that would apply to popular foods from Doritos and Skittles to Toaster Strudels and breads made with bleached flour.
It marks the first time a state, rather than the federal government, has tried to put its own warning labels on food.
While the bill passed the Texas House and Senate with bipartisan support, its sponsors are eagerly tying it to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement.

“This is about the MAHA parents and the crunchy granola parents coming together to say we are sick and tired of being sick and tired,” state Rep. Lacey Hull, who partnered with fellow Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst to sponsor the bill, told legislators before the House voted on May 25.
“I have personally spoken to the White House, who said they are looking to us, to Texas, to get this done, to stand for our children and for our future,” Hull said.
Abbott has not yet said whether he will sign the bill. It also includes other statewide health mandates, such as expanding physical activity requirements in public schools and setting new nutrition education requirements for high school and higher education students.
But the food warning label has drawn the most attention.
The label would read: “WARNING: This product contains an ingredient that is not recommended for human consumption by the appropriate authority in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the United Kingdom.”

Critics of food dyes and additives say they are most often found in low-nutrient, ultra-processed foods that promote unhealthy eating habits and contribute to chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes.
Some artificial dyes that are permitted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in foods are not recommended by its counterparts in other Western countries. European Union regulators require warning labels on some foods containing synthetic dyes, saying they may have an adverse effect on children’s activity and attention. In January, the FDA banned the artificial coloring Red No. 3, which is used in many foods and drinks in the U.S. but has been linked to cancer in animals. California became the first state to ban its use in 2023. That bill was sponsored by a Democrat and goes into effect in 2027.
But in Texas, the snack industry is pushing back. A coalition of dozens of food industry and business groups — including Walmart, General Mills and Coca-Cola — wrote a letter in opposition to the Texas bill’s warning label provision, saying it “casts an incredibly wide net” and goes too far.

“Texans deserve honest labeling; but they also deserve public policy that’s been studied, vetted, and evaluated for health considerations as well as economic impacts,” the organizations said in a letter circulated around the Texas legislature ahead of the House vote in May.
Yet opposition from some of the country’s largest food manufacturers may not be enough to halt the MAHA train.
The legislation with the labeling requirement joins other Republican-sponsored bills in the Texas legislature and around the country that reflect Kennedy’s MAHA agenda, from ending the addition of fluoride to public waters systems to loosening vaccine restrictions.
In March, West Virginia became the first state to pass a sweeping ban on synthetic food dyes. At least two dozen other states considered similar food dye bans in this most recent legislative session, according to data from the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group that pushes for removal of chemicals from food and consumer products.
At the federal level, the FDA under Kennedy’s direction has also asked the food industry to phase out certain synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, though some of the largest companies have said the timeline may not be feasible.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Organizations representing wildlife, land conservation and local governments testified Wednesday at a public hearing to push for the passage of a Republican bill to reauthorize the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program while advocating for a number of amendments to the bill’s text. 
The proposal’s authors, Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), say the current version of the bill is a starting point for negotiations. Without a deal, the 35-year-old program will lapse despite its popularity among voters. 
The challenge for legislators is that despite overwhelming public support for land conservation, a subset of the Republican members of the Legislature have grown opposed to the grant program. In their view, the grant program allows land to be taken off the local property tax roll and blocks  commercial development. 
That opposition has grown stronger since the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in a 6-1 decision last year that the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee’s authority to place anonymous holds on stewardship grant projects is unconstitutional. 
Kurtz has said that without returning some level of legislative oversight, the Republican opposition to the program won’t get on board with reauthorizing it. But the bill also needs to be palatable to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers so that he will sign it and any Republican opposition to the bill could make the votes of Democratic legislators more important. 
In an effort to recruit  Republican holdouts, the bill includes a provision that requires the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to submit a list to the Legislature each January of any major land acquisitions costing more than $1 million the department plans to purchase with stewardship funds that year. The Legislature would then need to approve each proposed project in a piece of legislation and provide the required appropriation. 
To gain the support of environmental groups, the bill allows stewardship dollars to be used for the first time to fund habitat restoration projects. 
Following a recent trend of Republican-authored legislation, the bill separates the policy changes to the program from the budget appropriation to fund it in an attempt to sidestep Evers’ partial veto pen. 
Charles Carlin, the director of strategic initiatives at non-profit land trust organization Gathering Waters, said in his testimony at the hearing Wednesday that the bill’s authors had to “try and thread a challenging political path towards reauthorization.” 
At the hearing, testifying members of the public mainly highlighted two areas for improvement on the bill — clarifying how the DNR should prioritize habitat restoration, facility upkeep and land acquisition in award grants and more clearly laying out how the legislative approval process for major land acquisitions will work. 
As currently written, the bill would require the DNR to prioritize property development over land acquisition projects. 
Brian Vigue, freshwater policy director for Audubon Great Lakes, said those types of grants are so different that they should be considered separately. 
“Because habitat management projects are so different from land acquisition projects, it really will make it difficult for the DNR to determine which of the two types of grant applications would have priority over the other,” he said. “It’s kind of an apples to oranges comparison to make so I think a practical solution to this challenge is to create a separate appropriation for wildlife habitat grants.” 
A number of organizations testifying called for more direct language outlining how the legislative oversight process will work, such as binding timelines for when the Legislature must consider the projects on the DNR list, clear guidelines for how projects will be evaluated and quickly held votes on project approval. 
Representatives of organizations that work to purchase private land and conserve it through conservation easements or deals with the state said that the opportunities to purchase a piece of land and save it for future enjoyment by the broader public come rarely and that those real estate transactions can often be complicated and take a long time. If a deal is largely in place except for the required legislative approval — which could potentially take years or never even come up for a vote — landowners might be unwilling to participate in the process. 
“Opportunities to provide such access sometimes only come once in a generation,” said Tony Abate, conservation director at Groundswell Conservancy, a non-profit aimed at conserving land in south central Wisconsin. “We are concerned with the funding threshold and the logistics of the proposed major land acquisition program. Real estate near population centers is expensive, and we often compete with non-conservation buyers to secure farmland or recreational lands.”
Abate said that of the conservancy’s 16 current projects, four would surpass the $1 million threshold and require legislative approval. He suggested raising the threshold to $5 million.
Carlin, with Gathering Waters, said the provision as currently written could indefinitely delay projects. 
“We appreciate legislators’ concerns with oversight, and we welcome discussion about how to provide effective and efficient oversight,” he said. “Unfortunately, the current proposal lacks defined timelines, transparent evaluation processes or mechanisms to require timely votes. Without these elements, worthy conservation projects could languish indefinitely. So we would ask that any review process include binding timelines, transparent project evaluation and timely votes to ensure strong oversight while maintaining predictability for applicants.”
At the hearing, members of the committee asked few questions of the testifying groups and members of the public. Democrats on the committee pushed more than once to make sure they see the partner bill providing the money for the program before voting on the policy changes. 
All of the testimony at the hearing Wednesday was either to provide information only to the legislators or in favor of the bill. The committee received one written comment against the bill’s passage, from the Wisconsin Bear Hunters’ Association.

State leaders are warning protesters to avoid violence during planned weekend protests. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia leaders say they are prepared to respond if weekend protests turn violent.
“My office remains in close contact with state and local law enforcement and stands ready to take whatever appropriate action is needed to safeguard our communities from crime and violence while also respecting the constitutional right to peaceful assembly,” Gov. Brian Kemp said in a statement on social media. “My support for public safety officers and the rule of law is unwavering, and any violence against those who protect and serve will be met with quick and heavy accountability.”
Organizers around the country are planning demonstrations Saturday against the Trump administration as part of the “No Kings” events. More than two dozen protests are planned in Georgia, from Dalton to Valdosta, according to organizers.
Tensions are high across the country as photos and footage from Los Angeles depict smoldering vehicles and clashes between protesters and police – fallout from protests over tactics used in raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The situation in California intensified after President Donald Trump deployed National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, who said local law enforcement was sufficient to keep the peace. The last time a president called up the National Guard to a state without the approval of its governor was in 1965 when President Lyndon Johnson deployed troops to protect civil rights activists against the wishes of segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
The second Trump presidency has already seen numerous protests in Georgia over immigration, federal spending cuts and other actions by the administration. One of them turned violent Tuesday night when immigration protesters allegedly threw fireworks and rocks at police officers and their cars. No officers were seriously hurt, but at least six people were arrested, according to multiple news outlets.
Kemp previously called in the National Guard over heated protests, including in 2020 when protests over the deaths of George Floyd and other Black Americans turned violent and in 2023 after protests over the Atlanta police public safety training facility known as “Cop City” led to burning cop cars.
Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running for governor in 2026, issued a stern warning via a press release Wednesday:
“All Americans have the right to peacefully protest. No American has the right to destroy property, loot businesses, or attack law enforcement officers. It’s very simple. Protesters use words. Rioters use violence. There is no gray area. In Georgia, if you engage in violence for the purpose of changing public policy, you can be charged with Domestic Terrorism. The penalty for Domestic Terrorism is 5-35 years in jail.”
Many protesters say it’s the tactics used by the Trump administration and ICE that should be illegal.
“I grew up in a sundown town up north, so them being able to come in and violate that sanctity of homes, schools, businesses, it triggers something in me, and it makes me so uncomfortable with what’s going on,” Melissa Steach, a member of the Union of Southern Service Workers who works at Waffle House, said at a peaceful protest outside ICE headquarters Monday.
“It needs to stop,” she added. “We’re going to keep protesting until the raids stop. These people do so much for us, and I’m gonna keep standing with our brothers and sisters.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)The Ohio retired teachers’ pension fund has hired a former pensions expert from North Carolina as its new executive director.
Steven Toole, the previous head of the North Carolina Retirement Systems, will take over starting in mid-July.
He grew up outside Columbus and went to Ohio State University, according to his candidate material records.
“My experience extends to working closely with boards and stakeholders to ensure transparency, accountability, and integrity — values central to State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) Ohio’s guiding principles,” Toole wrote in a letter to a recruiter.
Currently, he works as a senior product manager at Principal, a retirement and investment company. He also gets some income from Home Depot, according to an ethics filing.
While working at the North Carolina retirement system, he managed a $100 billion pension system and $11.8 billion in defined contribution assets, serving approximately 1 million public employees, according to his candidate documents.
He worked as the executive director of the North Carolina system from 2011 to 2019, when he was fired, the records request shows.
According to Toole, in an email he sent to recruiter Dan Cummings, he stated that there were “no performance issues at all,” and he didn’t receive an explanation from the state treasurer as to why he was being removed.
Cummings told a board member that the former North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell replaced Toole when he came into office, emails show. The candidate document shows that he was replaced with Folwell’s “hand-chosen successor.”
However, Toole was replaced two years into the treasurer’s term. Once this was brought up by a board member, according to emails, the new STRS head suggested that the reason may be related to the treasurer’s “cost-cutting platform.”
More records are pending from the North Carolina Treasurer’s Office.
Following being let go from the North Carolina system, Toole then worked for Prudential Retirement. This was later bought out by another company, and his job was “eliminated,” according to the documents.
He worked in retirement benefits for nearly three decades at Nationwide Insurance before joining the North Carolina team, the documents show.
A close vote
His hiring comes after a year of controversy, during which the STRS board chair and one of the former board members were accused of participating in a $65 billion corruption scheme. The chair, Rudy Fichtenbaum, denies all allegations, and some retired educators are accusing Ohio Statehouse Republicans of trying to stop transparency.
“The high scrutiny and media attention surrounding STRS Ohio over the past eighteen months do not give me pause — rather, I see it as an opportunity to step into a leadership role, bring clarity, and strengthen trust among members, legislators, and stakeholders,” Toole wrote in his candidate document.
There are mainly two defined factions of the STRS population: “reformers” and those who want to keep the “status quo.”
In short, reformers want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the reform-minded members to have a majority of the board.
Fichtenbaum and all of the reformers on the board voted in support of Toole, while each of the status quo members, including appointees, voted against him.
The vote ended up being 6-5.
The current acting executive director, Aaron Hood, was also given his notice at the meeting.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Public safety officials are scrambling to make backup plans after Black Hills Energy announced it will develop a public safety power shut-off program this summer.
A public safety power shut-off is when a utility company turns off power to a community or area to mitigate wildfire risk. 
Trent Nincehelser, state radio manager for the South Dakota Bureau of Information and Technology, told members of the state Public Safety Communications Council at its Wednesday meeting in Pierre that state officials are “still wrapping our heads around” how the plans will impact emergency responders.
“As you can imagine, that creates a whole host of concerns for us in the public safety community,” Nincehelser said.
Shut-offs can disrupt communications, water wells and air conditioning as well as access to other needs, such as medical devices, that rely on electricity. The strategy has grown in recent years after a Pacific Gas & Electric equipment failure ignited the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 84 people, ranks as the deadliest wildfire in California history and resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of lawsuit settlements. The year before that, wind blew a tree onto a Black Hills Energy line in Custer State Park and ignited the Legion Lake Fire, which became the third largest wildfire ever measured in the Black Hills.










As you can imagine, that creates a whole host of concerns for us in the public safety community.


– Trent Nincehelser, SD Bureau of Information and Technology


Several factors are considered before shut-offs are implemented, including heat, humidity, wind speeds and the moisture level of vegetation. The shut-off is used as a “last resort” when other mitigation measures aren’t enough, according to Black Hills Energy.
Black Hills Energy Vice President Wes Ashton told South Dakota Searchlight that high-risk wildfire areas more likely to be affected by a shut-off are in rural, tree-lined areas with “minimal customer impact.” Affected customers would be alerted with phone calls, text messages, emails, notifications through traditional media and social media, and on the company website.
Public utilities are able to shut off service in case of emergency, according to state law. The Public Utilities Commission does not have authority to require, approve or deny shut-off plans.
Community members and local law enforcement have expressed concern about the plan to Black Hills media outlets.
South Dakota has a statewide communications network serving first responders. Nincehelser said the state is “double evaluating” propane fuel capacity at radio tower sites, generator power backups and “controlling things we can control” for state radio.
“We’re probably not going to know exactly what the risk is until they shut the power off one day and we get punched in the nose, and then we’ll know exactly what we’re dealing with,” Nincehelser said. “But to the extent that we can plan for this, I can assure you that we have put those wheels in motion already.”

What the state doesn’t have control over, he said, is “upstream challenges” including backup solutions for internet service providers, network providers and other communications companies that public safety relies upon.
“Any time that this public safety power shut-off plan could potentially be implemented, obviously that’s a really bad time for public safety communications to go down if you’re in the most critical parts of a potential wildfire season or having concerns about wildfires sparking,” Nincehelser said.
Ashton told South Dakota Searchlight the company has been working on the plan for “quite a while” and has spent decades building a wildfire mitigation strategy. He added that the company will continue meeting with stakeholders, elected officials and public safety officials until the plan is completed this summer to discuss how the plan would affect them.
He added that the shut-offs would occur on the “most extreme weather days.” Using historical modeling from the last six years, the shut-off would have only been implemented once or twice a year. The shut-off, based on that data, would have lasted between two and seven hours, Ashton said, not including the time it would take to check lines and make repairs before re-energizing the system.
“If the impact was limited in size and scale, it would be relatively easy and quick to get all the lines completed,” Ashton said. “But if there was damage that occurred and lines needed to be repaired, then that would obviously take longer.”
If a shut-off was required and lasted longer because there was damage to the system, it would be a sign of a potential wildfire avoided, Ashton said.
“Any impact to our system that could have caused this outage would have still occurred with that damage, but it would have been paired, potentially, with a fire,” Ashton said, “and that’s what we’re trying to stay ahead of as responsible stewards and partners to this area.”
Some other electric utilities serving South Dakota already have public safety power shut-off plans. NorthWestern Energy explains its shut-off plan and provides a map on its website. Xcel Energy explains its process for implementing a shut-off on its website as well.
The Black Hills Electric Cooperative will not implement a public safety power shut-off plan, according to its website; however, Black Hills Energy “controls the distribution system” that delivers power to a substation in the area, which could affect some cooperative members.

(Zachary Hiser | West Virginia Watch)As the nation’s capital prepares for a massive military parade to mark the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday, organizers in several West Virginia cities are planning to mark the day with anti-Trump protests. 
“No Kings Day of Action” rallies are planned for cities around the country, including Berkeley Springs, Bluefield, Buckhannon, Charleston, Elkins, Huntington and others.
The events are in response to what the organization calls “increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption” from the president and allies. 
“In America, we don’t do kings,” reads a statement on Indivisible.org, the website for a grassroots organization made up of hundreds of local groups. “They’ve defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights, and slashed our services. The corruption has gone too far. No thrones. No crowns. No kings.”
An estimated 200,000 attendees, 150 military vehicles and 50 aircraft are expected for Trump’s military parade in Washington, D.C. Saturday, according to news reports. The spectacle will cost an estimated $45 million, including $16 million to repair the streets of D.C. following the event. 
A spokesman for the West Virginia National Guard said Wednesday that the agency will not send personnel or equipment to participate in the military parade, but they do plan to send 200 members of the CERF-P team to support the Nation Capital Region, at its request, as part of the Guard’s standing missing to support events of its size. 
Trump has defended the cost of the event, calling it “peanuts compared to the value of doing it,” in a recent interview with NBC News. 
“We have the greatest missiles in the world,” Trump said. “We have the greatest submarines in the world. We have the greatest army tanks in the world. We have the greatest weapons in the world. And we’re going to celebrate it.”
To Dr. Kate Waldeck, one of the organizers for Saturday’s rally in Huntington, the parade is another example of the “massive” amount of money that Republicans want to divert from people who need it. The Trump-backed, “big, beautiful bill” that passed the House of Representatives and is making its way through the Senate would cut billions in funding to Medicaid and food assistance to low-income Americans.  
“We’re seeing, increasingly, that our social safety net is going to be stripped away,” Waldeck said. “And obviously, we hope that this political situation is temporary, but in the meantime, the reality is that we’re going to have to build new networks for our people. So our theme for this [rally] is “No Kings,” but we are taking that and extending it to just to… “No kings, just community.”
Huntington’s event will include speakers, music, guided meditation for kids, bystander and Narcan training as well as a goods drive for Lily’s Place, Harmony House and the local city mission, she said. 
“We want to have a good time with our community, and we want to show our neighbors, especially even the ones that don’t feel safe coming to events like this, so people who are minorities or noncitizens, that we’re thinking of them,” Waldeck said. She added that everyone is welcome at the nonpartisan, nonviolent protest event “as long as they adhere to the ground rules of no racism, no homophobia and transphobia.” 
Debra Kilgore of Mercer County Indivisible, is helping organize the event in Bluefield. 
“I couldn’t stay silent any longer,” Kilgore said of her reasons for protesting. “I couldn’t hope that someone else will take care of these issues and make and hold our representatives accountable, because it’s not happening, especially in our state, where we have our Republican representatives in the federal government who are going along with everything.”
The Constitution grants Congress the power to levy tariffs, but they’ve allowed Trump to “run the tariff show,” she said. 
“They’re letting it happen,” she said. “And so, watching, I’ll call them the enablers. I can’t rely on somebody else to do something anymore.”
While Mercer County, like the rest of West Virginia, voted overwhelmingly to elect Trump to a second term, Kilgore said as the year wears on, she’s hearing from people that they no longer support the president.
“More and more people are saying, ‘You know, I may have voted for Trump, but I didn’t expect this,’” she said. “Or people who never voted for Trump but in this area are afraid to say ‘I’m not a Trump voter,’ are starting to make their presence known.”
The events Saturday come as protests against Trump’s immigration policies continue in Los Angeles. 
The Trump administration is sending nearly 5,000 National Guard troops and Marines to the city, against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom, a Democrat, called Trump’s move a “brazen abuse of power,” according to news reports. 
In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott deployed the National Guard across the state as more demonstrations are expected there Wednesday. 
“Peaceful protest is legal,” Abbott wrote on the social media platform X. “Harming a person or property is illegal & will lead to arrest. [The Texas National Guard] will use every tool & strategy to help law enforcement maintain order.”
Waldeck said she’s concerned about the National Guard being deployed to respond to protests against Newsom’s will, but she’s not concerned about the protests themselves becoming violent. 
“We are aware of the national situation obviously, and [host organization] 50501 is unwavering in its commitment to peaceful protest, so we will have event staff there trained in de-escalation in the event there are counter protestors etc,” Waldeck said.
Cindy Stemple, chair of the Randolph County Democratic Executive Committee, said the event they’re planning for Elkins will be a “peaceful celebration of our country and flag.” The event will feature speakers and musicians. Anyone who wants to sing or play an instrument will be allowed to do so. 
“I think the protests are generally going to be peaceful unless Trump and everybody incites the people,” Stemple said. “That’s kind of my feeling. Now, I’m not in LA, I don’t know. I’m not in Texas. I’m not in D.C., but when you have somebody threatening a first right, First Amendment right, which is a right to peaceful protest, there’s a problem.”
Stemple said Saturday’s event will be the Elkins community eighth anti-Trump and “pro-Democracy” rally. At each one, they’ve also collected donations for community needs like flood relief for Southern West Virginia or contributions to the local food pantry, she said.
“We are trying to do something good most every time that we hold one of these — and I call it a celebration,” she said. “We become friends [and] allies just standing up for our country and enjoying the time together.”
The rallies are planned for:

Noon to 1:30 p.m. at the Morgan County Courthouse in Berkeley Springs
Noon to 1:30 p.m. at the corner of King and Queen Streets in Martinsburg
Noon to 3 p.m. Saturday at Bluefield Downtown Park, Federal and Commerce Streets in Bluefield

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign is suing billionaire Elon Musk over allegations that he violated multiple state laws, including the election bribery statute, when he offered voters a potential $1 million award for signing a petition as part of his effort to sway the result of Wisconsin’s April Supreme Court election. 
Represented by Wisconsin’s Law Forward, Democracy Defenders Fund and New York-based law firm Hecker Fink, the lawsuit accuses the world’s richest man of implementing “a brazen scheme to bribe Wisconsin citizens to vote.” 
Musk and his political action committee, America PAC, played a major role in this spring’s election becoming the most expensive judicial campaign in American history. Musk’s involvement in the race, which came as he was leading President Donald Trump’s cost-cutting initiatives and firing thousands of federal employees through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), was widely seen as causing a backlash and helping Dane County Judge Susan Crawford defeat Musk-backed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel. 
Musk and his PAC spent more than $20 million on the race. 
Prior to the election, America PAC offered voters $100 if they signed a petition “in opposition to activist judges,” and another $100 if they referred another voter to sign the petition. Later, at a pre-election rally in Green Bay, Musk handed out two $1 million checks to voters, which had been advertised as awards “in appreciation for you taking the time to vote.” 
The lawsuit, filed in Dane County court, notes it is against the law to offer anyone more than $1 to induce them to go to the polls, vote or vote for a particular candidate. 
“By offering and paying Wisconsin citizens amounts far greater than $1 to vote, Defendants violated Wisconsin’s election bribery law,” the lawsuit states. “Defendants’ payments and offers of payment to Wisconsin voters, made with the clear intent to aid one candidate and induce Wisconsinites to vote, threatened the integrity of the election and damaged public confidence in the electoral system.”
Jeff Mandell, Law Forward’s general counsel, said the lawsuit was meant to prevent efforts like Musk’s from becoming a regular occurrence. 
“We are fighting for free and fair elections,” Mandell said. “We believe our democracy demands better than schemes like the one detailed in our complaint. So, we are working to hold Musk accountable and stop this from becoming the new normal.”

Josh Stein for approval.
Senate Bill 50, “Freedom to Carry NC,” would allow individuals who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age, and not otherwise prohibited by law, to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s one of the most controversial topics of the legislative session.
Members of Republican leadership support the bill, which would make North Carolina the 30th state to approve of so-called “constitutional carry.”
Republican Reps. Ted Davis of New Hanover and William Brisson of Bladen and Sampson counties voted against the bill. Davis also voted against the measure during Tuesday’s House Rules Committee hearing.
Ten Republicans and 3 Democrats abstained from voting.
Stein signaled to reporters on Tuesday that he would veto the bill, according to The Carolina Journal. It’s possible the legislature doesn’t have the numbers to override a gubernatorial veto after Republicans lost their supermajority in the House following November’s elections.
Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort) presented SB 50 to the chamber.
  Rep. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort) (NCGA screengrab)
“It allows people to constitutionally carry a firearm without obtaining a permit from the government to exercise their God-given right to defend themselves,” he said.
The bill does not change who may buy a firearm or the circumstances surrounding when or where an individual can carry a firearm, Kidwell said.
Debate was lengthy, lasting about an hour. Roughly half of a dozen Democrats rose to speak out against the legislation, while a handful of Republicans defended it.
Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake) cited surveys from Everytown for Gun Safety and Elon University that found a large majority of North Carolina voters were against removing permit requirements from concealed carry laws.
Rep. Allen Buansi (D-Orange) said the bill made him think of his community: the people and the law enforcement.
“This bill would make their jobs a whole lot harder and put them at an even greater risk,” he said.
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham) proposed an amendment that would remove the first section of the legislation — the parts about eliminating the permit process.
It would leave the portions about compensating the families of gun violence victims. These provisions were added by Democratic amendments when the measure appeared on the Senate floor in March.
“I just ask you to vote, pick out the most controversial, dangerous part of the bill,” Morey said.
Kidwell asked the chamber to shut down Morey’s amendment.
“This basically just guts out the bill,” he said.
The amendment failed by a vote of 46-61.
Morey argued that SB 50 itself highlights the harm it will cause.
“The first part eradicates the need for a permit to carry a concealed weapon, yet the rest of the bill addresses the irreparable damage that will come,” she said. “It increases compensation for families, of slain law enforcement, EMS. It provides scholarships for children whose family members die.”
  Rep. Tracy Clark (D-Guilford)(NCGA screengrab)
Rep. Tracy Clark (D-Guilford) shared two emotional stories about her own experience and trauma from guns.
A childhood friend died by suicide while the pair attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill together. Four years later, Clark lost another friend, Eve Carson, to homicide.
Carson, UNC-Chapel Hill’s student body president, was shot and killed near the campus in March 2008.
“Two totally different stories that I’m traumatized by: suicide with a good guy with a gun, homicide with two very bad guys with a gun,” Clark said. “I have to speak out today because this bill goes too far.”
House Democratic leader Robert Reives said he was moved by Clark’s painful remembrance of her friends lost to gun violence.
“I felt I would be less of a man not to stand up and tell her how much I feel those stories,” said Reives.
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) reminded the chamber that he, like many of his friends, are part of the baby boomer generation born to World War II veterans whose parents taught them how to own weapons responsibly. Adams said he has owned firearms since he was 11 years old.
But circumstances are different now, Rep. Amos Quick (D-Guilford) retorted. He said everybody is a law-abiding citizen until they’re not.
“When I was in school, no one thought about a school shooting,” he said. “If we pass this bill, we are opening the door potentially for more of our children to have to endure the horrors of being locked in their classroom, because one of their classmates, 18 years old, had the state of North Carolina’s stamp of approval to go and get a weapon and conceal it and walk in the school.”
North Carolinians Against Gun Violence are calling on Governor Stein to veto SB 50.
  Becky Ceartas, executive director of NCGV
“The safeguards we lose if we repeal the requirement for a concealed carry weapons permit are all too dangerous to risk when it comes to public carry of firearms in North Carolina,” said Becky Ceartas, executive director of NCGV. “Without a background check, the public and law enforcement do not know who is illegally carry a concealed weapon or not.”
Ceartas said weak concealed carry weapon permitting laws also increase gun thefts by approximately 35%.
“The General Assembly is taking us in the wrong direction for our state, and we urge Governor Stein to veto this dangerous bill.”
Immediately after approving SB 50, the House passed legislation (HB 811CS) that would appropriate $1 million in recurring funds over the next two fiscal years. This would allow North Carolina’s community colleges to establish a comprehensive firearm safety instruction course, making “the instruction as accessible as possible to all citizens 18 years and older who seek to enroll.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1695-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

The Alaska Department of Corrections received and detained 42 men in the Anchorage Correctional Complex over the weekend who were arrested outside of the state by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, amid a federal immigration crackdown.
The department released the names of the men who are originally from 22 different countries, including India, Vietnam, Egypt, Peru and Russia.
Two men were transferred out the day after they arrived on Monday, according to Betsy Holley, a department spokesperson. Forty men remain in custody at the Anchorage jail facility.
Holley said the men are expected to be held in the Anchorage facility for about a month. The men who were transferred were sent to Washington state, but she could not say where, she said. She referred all questions regarding where they were transferred from, their length of time in custody and the protocol for the transfers to ICE officials.
ICE did not respond to requests for comment.
The state has an existing contract with the U.S. Marshals Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Justice, for all federal detainees, or those facing federal charges, including awaiting hearings for immigration status or deportation. On May 1, the rate of federal reimbursement to the state increased from $202.21 to $223.70 per day.
The state policy with the U.S. Marshals Service does not specify if “federal detainees” means arrested and charged in Alaska or from out of state.
Alaska DOC had previously detained 11 people arrested by ICE this year, as of the end of May, the Anchorage Daily News reported.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Alaska’s Corrections Commissioner Jen Winkelman was also not available for comment.
Community members rallied outside the Anchorage jail on Monday night in support of the men, drawing a crowd of over 80 people, according to Michael Patterson, an organizer with the Anchorage chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a community group and part of a small national political party. The demonstration condemned the Dunleavy administration for participating in the nationwide immigration crackdown.
“Essentially, what has happened is that Gov. Dunleavy has turned the Anchorage Correctional Complex into an ICE detention facility,” he said by phone on Tuesday.
He said the demonstrators are calling for the families of the men to be notified that they are in Alaska, that they receive proper medical care and that they receive adequate translation services.
“Our biggest concern in PSL Anchorage is that they’re not going to receive the proper and adequate medical care, because the Department of Corrections does not even do that for Alaskans that are in DOC custody,” he said.
The group runs a confidential 24-hour hotline to report ICE activity in Anchorage, provide resources and support, and dispatch a team of trained volunteer observers to document arrests.
“The goal is that they’re there for documentation purposes,” said Cynthia Gachupin, a volunteer who has worked as a victims rights advocate, by phone Tuesday. “It’s not to escalate a situation or to put anybody else in danger. Because, I mean, these families are already really frightened when these things are occurring. The goal is to be able to help them, and not to make a situation more tense. But documentation of an ICE event is super important.”
She said documenting arrests helps individuals as they’re moved through ICE custody and detention, and helps families track them. “A lot of these families don’t know where their family members are. And now, if they’re moving and moving and moving them, like how are they going to get in contact with them?” she said. “It’s just really wrong, I think morally as human to human, I don’t think under any reason we should be treating people that way.”

This story by Joyce Marcel was first published in The Commons on June 10.
BRATTLEBORO — The MicroMoo bus service is being discontinued by Southeast Vermont Transit, which runs the Holstein-decorated MOOver buses, leaving many people unable to get to and from work during hours when regular buses do not operate.
The MicroMoo bus, launched as a pilot project in April 2024, was running weekdays from 5 to 11 p.m. as an on-demand service as opposed to a fixed route, so that riders could go directly from one point to another within the town.
Its last run is scheduled for June 13. None of the other, more traditional MOOver routes are affected by the decision.
The service did not attract the ridership it anticipated, the service’s Chief Executive Officer Randy Schoonmaker told The Commons in May.
On average, 18 riders used the service each day — 64% less than the projected number of 50, according to a Southeast Vermont Transit presentation at a public hearing about the discontinuation in Brattleboro on May 12.
The total cost of running the service for a year was approximately $180,000, according to state Sen. Wendy Harrison, D-Windham, who has taken the issue under her wing.
Originally supported for its launch by the Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation via a grant from the Northern Borders Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Dislocated Worker National Reserve Demonstration program, and later with funds from the Thompson Trust and the Agency of Transportation, the service cost $54 per rider, exceeding the state’s limit of $50.
Of that cost, $24,000 was contributed by the town’s Human Services Committee, which made it clear at the time that the funding of the local match would be a one-year-only commitment.
But even so, the state Agency of Transportation, which uses federal funding for the buses, has been facing a $1.5 million shortfall and thus required the seven public transit companies that provide bus services to reduce their budgets.
In the end, the Southeast Vermont Transit board voted to cut the Brattleboro MicroMoo in March.
“We’ve gone from an $18 million budget when I was here 15 years ago, to $53 million,” Ross MacDonald, the Agency of Transportation’s public transit program manager, told The Commons in May. “We know that there’s a lot of service gaps out there. Right now we’re working with all the providers to try and find some level of cost savings so that we can make the 2026 budget work.
“We were hoping, when we put the numbers together last year, that the cost curve would be bending downward. But it actually came up a little bit,” MacDonald said. “So we knew we’d have to make some cuts to make budget. We’re hoping not to make any more cuts, but right now, the cuts that we’ve made are based on general performance and not entirely because of budget restraints.”
Harrison was hoping the town might pick up the bill for the next two years, but this was a tight year for budgeting in Brattleboro and funding the MicroMoo was not high on anyone’s list of priorities.
“It didn’t have enough ridership right now,” Harrison said. “But it usually takes two or three years for ridership to develop.”
‘And now it’s going away’
For the riders who did use it, the service will be sorely missed.
At the public hearing, Micah Ranquist told Southeast Vermont Transit leadership, state officials, and regional planners that he had been using “all the different bus system things” since approximately 2010.
“And this is the first glimmer of hope and a big change, and now it’s going away,” said Ranquist, who is blind and spoke of the potential of the MicroMoo to restore a degree of independence and dignity.
“I heard from one woman who works as a nighttime janitor who took the MicroMoo and now will have to walk miles just to get to work,” Harrison said. “I talked to another person who cannot drive because she has epilepsy. She depended on the bus.
“For people who can’t drive, not having public transportation in the evening essentially keeps them from going to a restaurant or a movie. And businesses benefit from their employees having transportation to night-shift jobs. We need to get the Moover board to support it again.”
One rider, Marie-Claire Rose, circulated a petition to keep the MicroMoo van on the road. She garnered 411 signatures.
“I am frustrated that the amount of public interest you were able to show was not enough to make the change at this time,” Harrison wrote to Rose after the final closing was announced. “I’ll keep looking for ways to extend or resume the service.”
Harrison chaired the public hearing on May 12, where Ranquist and other riders spoke about their need for the service.
“There was a good turnout, and the riders explain how important it is in their own words,” Harrison wrote to the Selectboard. “I also understand that the service is also used by kids staying after 5 p.m. at the Boys and Girls Club and by refugees residing at SIT.”
Public transportation is limited in the Brattleboro area, and the loss of the MicroMoo puts many people at a disadvantage. And those who developed and championed the service acknowledge that the service deserved more time to find its user base. Several users also voiced frustrations about hiccups and frustrations with the mobile app that the service required.
“Being in this situation reminds us why we need to avoid potentially starting up services that we cannot sustain,” MacDonald told the participants at the public hearing.
“There is certainly a place for microtransit in Brattleboro,” said Harrison, who sees the service as “beneficial to connect with Amtrak as well as the work rides and social connection that the existing service provides.”
“I have not been able to find an alternative source of funding but will continue my pursuit,” she said.

Michelle Lujan’s drought declaration missed a few points,"Jerry Redfern, Capital & Main",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/06/11/gov-michelle-lujans-drought-declaration-missed-a-few-points/,New Mexico's increasing drought and the industry funding much of the state budget — oil and gas —go hand in hand,"Smoke billows from a wildfire in the cottonwood forest along the Rio Grande in Socorro County, New Mexico, on April 27. (Jerry Redfern)In late May, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office sent out a press release announcing an executive order that declared a drought emergency and state of emergency in New Mexico. The order itself was missing two things: It didn’t actually include an emergency declaration, and it didn’t say why the state was in the midst of the worst drought conditions in recorded history.
Lujan Grisham’s order did urge local governments to consider “appropriate” firework bans. It also told the New Mexico Drought Task Force to meet and make “near-term action recommendations no later than July 31” — more than two months after the executive order was signed, and deep into fire season.
  
(Lauren Dodd Thorp, communications assistant to the governor, said that while the order “does not specifically use the terms ‘drought emergency’ or ‘state of emergency,’ it does function as an emergency declaration under the Governor’s authority.”)



				This story originally appeared in Capital & Main and is republished with permission.			


The order didn’t say what is making the drought as bad as it is, but scientists in New Mexico have. “Climate change is making things worse,” said Dave DuBois, New Mexico’s state climatologist.
The warming climate doesn’t cause droughts, but it does increase the likelihood that they become longer, hotter and more intense, exactly what New Mexico is experiencing.
Tree ring studies infer historical periods of drought and abundant rain via ring thickness. In New Mexico they show that “the current drought has been one of the most intense we’ve seen in hundreds of years,” DuBois said. “The overall trend is heading toward a warmer climate … There is nothing to show us that trend is going to change a lot.”
In fact, there is “a mountain of evidence” that the warming and drought is caused by humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions, said David Gutzler, professor emeritus of climate science at the University of New Mexico. And those emissions come from burning fossil fuels like oil and natural gas.
“There is no other plausible explanation,” he said, “And the evidence keeps getting stronger and stronger.”











There is very little appetite in policymaking that has any kind of regulatory effect on the oil and gas industry. ~


– Lucas Herndon, energy policy director, ProgressNow New Mexico


 
That evidence puts New Mexico in a tight spot. Among the nation’s states, only Texas produces more oil, and only a few produce more natural gas, depending on the week.
The irony for New Mexico is that those fossil fuels heating the atmosphere also fund more than a third of the state’s general budget and all that entails: a third of school spending; a third of road building; and a third of the effort to mitigate ever-increasing drought and fire seasons.
New Mexico doesn’t spend very much, though, on containing the industry that funds budgets and warms the atmosphere.
“There is very little appetite in policymaking that has any kind of regulatory effect on the oil and gas industry,” said Lucas Herndon, energy policy director at ProgressNow New Mexico.
He said his group recently reviewed every legislative session since Lujan Grisham took office in 2019 and found that no major oil and gas legislation made it to a floor vote in the state Legislature in that time.
He said oil and gas companies “have successfully killed any real attempt at any comprehensive reform of their industry” in New Mexico. That includes legislation in the past session that tried to codify Lujan Grisham’s much-touted methane regulations, which she often points to as an environmental win.
Methane is the main component of natural gas and it is a potent greenhouse gas, with more than 80 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide. Beginning in 2021, oil and gas producers are required to reduce natural gas leaks and emissions to less than 2% of production by the end of 2026. In addition, starting in 2022, they also have had to reduce releases of other volatile organic compounds — like benzene, toluene and hexane — that form the building blocks of toxic ozone pollution.
New Mexico’s methane emissions appear to have dropped since the rules were implemented, but rules do not have the long-term durability of law, and in the past four years the state’s Democrat-controlled Legislature hasn’t made them so.
Herndon said that industry has maintained its perfect record of preventing regulatory legislation with a flood of money that crested this year. His group just tallied all lobbying dollars spent in New Mexico in this year’s legislative session and found that 54% was spent by the oil and gas industry.
“That’s an incredible amount,” he said.
The industry is also biggest when it comes to the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. Across the country as a whole, transportation is the largest overall greenhouse gas emitting sector, followed by electricity generation. But in New Mexico, leaks and emissions from the oil and gas production process top the list. It’s a rare distinction the state shares with Alaska.
Coincidentally, Lujan Grisham was at the Fourth Annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage last week. In a press release she noted the state’s hydrogen and geothermal energy developments and also said, “New Mexico produces some of the cleanest liquefied natural gas in the world, thanks in large part to our nation-leading methane emission standards.” The state does have some of the country’s strongest methane standards, but claims of “clean” liquified natural gas are debated.
She planned to discuss federal partnerships for New Mexico’s “advanced energy initiatives” with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.
The partnerships may prove difficult. Just two years ago, Wright said, “There is no climate crisis and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition either.” Zeldin, on his first day in office at the EPA, said, “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.” And Burghum, on his first day in office, said, “Interior will focus on ways to eliminate harmful, coercive climate policies.” Since taking office, all three have promised to roll back federal oil and gas production regulations.
Lujan Grisham traveled to Alaska with Rob Black, recently appointed secretary of the New Mexico Economic Development Department. Previously, Black spent six years as the president of the New Mexico Chamber of Commerce, where he regularly testified on behalf of the state’s oil and gas industry at the New Mexico Legislature.
The governor’s office did not respond to questions about the trip by publication time.

Meanwhile, others in the state are preparing for future fires.
Laura McCarthy, New Mexico’s state forester, said, “We’re looking at above significant fire danger, particularly in the southwest/south central regions of the state.” She said that includes the state’s two biggest metro areas, Albuquerque and Las Cruces, and two areas that have already been walloped by years of drought-fueled fires, the Gila and Lincoln national forests.
“This risk comes from the persistent drought the state faces, low precipitation over last winter and mistakes that people make,” she said. Those mistakes aren’t directly related to oil and gas policy. “The data tells us that the majority of our fires are caused not by malicious behavior but by folks making mistakes when they’re outside on a windy day,” she said. The higher temperatures from global warming fan the flames of those mistakes.











I worry about those forests burning. And the sad part is that the data analyst part of me understands that those forests will burn. 


– David Gutzler, professor emeritus of climate science, University of New Mexico



The danger continues despite recent rains across the state. “Certainly, we love to see rain any time, but this year it is not a silver bullet to alleviate fire danger,” McCarthy said. In fact, it may well increase fire danger later this summer, because rain “allows for faster green-up of flashy fuels like grasses that can burn very fast and move a fire quickly in a high-wind situation,” she said.
Gutzler, the University of New Mexico climate scientist, said storms that suddenly dump huge amounts of rain are actually a signal of the warming climate. “As the climate warms up in general, the potential for extreme precipitation goes up,” he said. The science is complicated, but in rough terms, as air warms it can hold more water, leading to “tremendous dumps that exceed what we’ve seen historically.”
“I do not expect every year to look as dire as this year,” he continued, but this won’t be the last dire drought year.
Gutzler said, “In the short term … we must adapt.”
He lives north of Albuquerque, about a mile from the Rio Grande, which bisects the state from north to south. Gutzler said usually it is “a full, freely flowing river this time of the year.” But this year he and his wife hiked along its banks on Memorial Day, “and it’s not a high flowing river, for sure. So that’s troubling.”
Looking up at the neighboring Sandia Mountains from the trail, “I worry about those forests burning. And the sad part is that the data analyst part of me understands that those forests will burn,” he said. “Our forests are at a dire risk. That is part of climate change. That is daunting to think about.
“So the hopeful part of me [thinks] people have dealt with droughts forever here, and have muddled through them. And I’m reasonably confident we can muddle through this one,” Gutzler said.
“Having said that, I don’t expect a return anytime soon to the wet decades of the end of the 20th century,” Gutzler said. “We need to be careful.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/wildfirejerryredfern-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)A trio of abortion-related bills, passed in 2021, were declared unconstitutional by a nearly unanimous Montana Supreme Court on Monday.
Nearly, because Justice Jim Rice wrote both a concurring and dissenting opinion affirming again Montana’s constitutionally protected right-to-privacy, which includes medical procedures and abortion.
The laws were halted before they could even be practically enacted, so the hurdles to the procedure, including waiting periods, mandatory ultrasound, a pile of documentation and banning abortion after 20 weeks, even before the point of fetal viability, never rippled throughout the state.
Justice Beth Baker wrote the opinion on behalf of the court, which not only reaffirmed the state Constitution’s right-to-privacy as unique and separate from federal cases on abortion, but also took the state to task for failing to support its claim that the State of Montana had a compelling interest in abortion, while not proving that any of the legislative hurdles were scientifically supported.
The lawsuit was brought by Planned Parenthood of Montana, and had a handful of other entities that wrote friends-of-the-court briefs, including a group of delegates to the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention.
The three laws that were challenged were House Bill 136, House Bill 140 and House Bill 171:

HB 136 would have banned abortion at 20 weeks, even though expert opinion agreed that fetal viability is not possible until at least 22 weeks.
HB 171 would have put paperwork and more requirements for healthcare providers who provide abortion via medication or telehealth, subjecting them to both civil and criminal penalties.
HB 180 would have required healthcare professionals to provide both ultrasound and fetal heartbeat tones to those considering abortion, and requiring a patient to sign a form created by the state, demonstrating that the patient had been offered the choice, and yet declined.

Because fetal viability — or the concept a child can survive outside the womb — is dictated by a host of factors, including medical science and approximate age of the fetus, the court rejected the state’s attempts to prescribe a fixed number of weeks for viability.
“A fixed gestational age that does not allow a provider’s case-specific determination fails to ensure that the government does not interfere with an individual’s private medical decision,” the ruling said. “Until a fetus is viable and able to survive outside the womb, the right of personal autonomy belongs to the person on whose body the fetus depends.
“We find no legal authority for the idea that the state’s interest in preserving fetal life or the fetus’ right to life takes precedence over all constitutional protections and dignities of the mother.”
Attorneys for the state had argued that physical safety risks of abortion increase as the pregnancy progresses, and that abortions lead to worse mental health outcomes, an argument that the Supreme Court dismissed and debunked.
“The record shows that abortion is safe,” the decision said. “As the district court noted, there were zero deaths cause by abortion in Montana between 2010 and 2020 and only 25 of 8,402 (0.3%) reported abortions in Montana from 2016 to 2021 resulted in complications. This court cannot find a bona fide health risk simply based on a detailed step-by-step description of what the state defines as ‘barbaric’ and ‘gruesome’ procedure when the overwhelming evidence shows that procedural abortions are safe.”
The ruling also said if the state wanted to address health outcomes or mental health issues, banning abortion was not the least restrictive way to do it.
The court also pointed out waiting-periods and requiring multiple in-person visits, as outlined by HB 171, actually increased the odds of harm or complications, instead of avoiding them.
“The record demonstrates that compliance with the 24-hour wait period, the multiple in-person visits, and the telehealth ban serve only to delay access to abortion care — thus increasing the odds that the patient will not be able to obtain an abortion or increasing the odds of the very complications this state asserts it wishes to protect against,” the opinion said.
The ruling also said in addition to violating the state’s constitutional provisions for privacy, it also impacted physician’s free-speech rights by requiring them to provide forms and documents, for example, information about a disputed abortion reversal procedure, that have not been medically verified or supported. They said HB 171 compelled healthcare professionals to give advice contrary to their training and conscience.
Physicians and experts also raised concerns about the state’s assertion abortion led to other health care concerns, for example, an increase in breast cancer, which has never been scientifically established.
“Forcing medical providers to give medical advice that they disagree with — like the safety and efficacy of abortion reversal — is a form of compelled-speech triggering protections,” the ruling said. “(Planned Parenthood) asserts that patients may mistakenly understand the consent form to indicate DPHHS’s and their provider’s approval of abortion reversal.”
The ruling calls such compelled speech egregious because it “favors one viewpoint over another — namely, the viewpoint that abortion reversal is safe and possible over the judgements and viewpoints of providers that it is unsafe, ineffective and undermines informed consent.”
The court noted the state does not mandate documentation or consent that requires medical providers to discuss the risk of carrying a pregnancy to term.
Finally, the court also called into question the real purpose of HB 140, which mandates ultrasounds and fetal heart tones before an abortion, something that providers said either happens during the course of pregnancy, but may not be medically necessary.
“The court stated it was ‘left with the strong impression that the law aims to advance the ulterior motive of discouraging abortion,’ which is unacceptable under the law,” the ruling said.
Montana’s highest court found that in the case of HB 140, it was exactly substituting the judgment of the state, and the lawmakers who supported it, with the views of the doctor.
“The court’s decision further protects what Montanans need and deserve: Legal access to compassionate, timely abortion care, free from government interference. At the same moment as this win for Montanans, anti-abortion politicians continue to threaten to decimate access to care by ‘defunding’ Planned Parenthood via the reconciliation bill before Congress, in an effort to shut down health centers who provide abortion and other reproductive care. Montanans agree that abortion should remain legal and accessible, and Planned Parenthood of Montana will always do whatever we can to ensure that patients in Montana have access to abortion care,” said Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Montana Planned Parenthood, after the ruling in a statement.
The case was active for several years of litigation, and had district court Judge Amy Eddy sitting in place of former Chief Justice Mike McGrath, who retired at the end of 2024, as well as Judge Shane Vannatta, who was sitting in for Dirk Sandefur, who also retired.
McGrath has since been replaced by Chief Justice Cory Swanson, and Sandefur was succeeded by Justice Katherine Bidegaray.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mifepristone-tablets.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)This story was updated at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday, June 11, 2025, with the latest. 
Morrow resident Greg Thornton voted for Daniel Blackman in the Georgia Public Service Commission race Wednesday afternoon before he became aware that Blackman had been disqualified from the Democratic Party primary for an Atlanta-based district.
“It’s disappointing to hear my vote won’t matter,” Thornton said. “I didn’t know exactly what was going on but I’ll make sure I pay more attention (if) there is a runoff. I do care about who’s in control of what I pay on my electric bills.”
By Thursday morning, Georgia polling stations will be required to have signs telling voters that, while Blackman’s name will appear on the ballot, any votes cast for him will not be counted.
Blackman was disqualified last month by an administrative law judge and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger for failing to meet residency requirements – a decision Blackman challenged.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville denied Blackman’s appeal Wednesday, ruling Blackman ineligible for Tuesday’s Democratic primary for District 3, which includes Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties.
Glanville ruled from the bench Tuesday, saying he believed the earlier decision to disqualify Blackman “properly considered the petitioner’s failure to update his voter registration until April of 2025.”
Under state law, a commission candidate must live in one of five districts for at least 12 months before an election.
Glanville issued his formal written order in the case late Wednesday.
Early voting is underway now and ends Friday for a pair of primary races for the commission. As of Wednesday evening, nearly 52,000 Georgians have cast a ballot.
Glanville wrote that the secretary of state erred in limiting testimony from Blackman about furniture and other personal belongings at the Atlanta resident but said he considered whether that was enough evidence to prove that Blackman intended to permanently live there.
“(Blackman) challenges the secretary’s determination that testimony was uncorroborated,” Glanville wrote. “The final decision examined the evidence advanced by (Blackman) and determined that it failed to corroborate his testimony. (Blackman) did not offer any witnesses with actual knowledge of his residence and limited documentary evidence.”
The last legal recourse for Blackman would be an expedited request to have the Georgia Supreme Court consider his appeal. He has not said whether he will go that route.
With Blackman out, that leaves three other Democrats in the race, including Keisha Sean Waites, a former Atlanta City Council member and Georgia House representative; Peter Hubbard, founder of the Center for Energy Solutions; and Robert Jones, who worked in energy regulation in California.
A runoff election will be held July 15 if one candidate fails to receive at least 50% of the vote in the primary.
Blackman had been considered a frontrunner in the race. He served as the Environmental Protection Agency’s Southeast regional administrator under the Biden administration, and he’s a former PSC candidate who came close to winning a seat on the commission back in 2020.
Blackman has remained on the ballot while appealing the May 27 ruling from Administrative Court Judge Dominic Capraro, who concluded that Blackman voting in Forsyth County in the Nov. 5 general election was proof that Blackman was not a legal resident of Fulton County.
Blackman has said his wife and children remained in Forsyth County to finish the school year while he relocated to an Atlanta residence.
Blackman’s attorney Matthew Wilson argued Tuesday that Blackman met state requirements as a commission candidate, including registering address changes 30 days in advance of an election.
“He told others his intent was to move to Fulton County and remain there for an indefinite period of time, starting October 2024,” Wilson said at Tuesday’s virtual court hearing.
Alexandra Noonan, an attorney for the state, said that Blackman failed to prove the Atlanta home was where he intended to live long term.
“None of that amounts to a presumption that he shares a domicile with his family,” she said Tuesday about previous witness testimony and evidence from Blackman.
The Democratic primary winner will face appointed Republican Commissioner Fitz Johnson in November to serve a one-year term. There will be another election in 2026 when Georgians will elect a commissioner for the district to a full six-year term.
The Georgia Public Service Commission is made up of five elected officials who regulate utilities for electricity, natural gas and telecommunications. Although commission seats are confined to geographical areas, all Georgians can vote on each race. All of the current commissioners are Republican.
The other commission primary on Tuesday’s ballot features Republican Commissioner Tim Echols, who is fighting off a challenge from Lee Muns for the District 2 position that spans from Hart County to Savannah. The GOP primary winner will face Democratic challenger Alicia M. Johnson in November.
The commission has faced criticism for approving a series of requests from Georgia Power to charge its ratepayers more to cover base electric rate increases, recover excess fuel costs, and expand Plant Vogtle. The average residential customer is paying $43 more per month since 2023.
State regulators are set to vote later this month on Georgia Power’s proposal to freeze its rates for the next three years, and the commissioners are set for a controversial vote this summer on the utility’s plans to lean on fossil fuels to meet growing energy demands primarily driven by data centers.

(Stock photo/Getty Images)With the clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, businesses have announced plans to create over 20,000 new clean energy jobs and invest over $32 billion into South Carolina’s economy over the next decade.
These strategic investments in advanced energy manufacturing, electric transportation, and electric grid resilience are powering job creation, revitalizing rural areas, and positioning South Carolina as a national leader in American-made energy. These clean energy tax credits are critical for businesses, like mine, here in South Carolina in order to maintain investment and continue growing the manufacturing base within the Palmetto State.
South Carolina’s power grid — like much of the nation’s — is aging and under rising pressure.
Demand from data centers, manufacturing expansions, and electric vehicles is expected to surge over the next decade. In South Carolina, the commercial and industrial electricity rates are 10.97 cents/kWh and 7.01 cents/kWh, respectively, and both are below the national average.
However, electricity rates are up almost 6% from the year prior. Reduced incentivized investment in clean energy infrastructure could lead to even higher prices due to a reliance on more expensive, traditional power sources. Strategic energy investments, supported by stable tax policies, will help us avoid future grid shortfalls, prevent the risk of rolling blackouts, and reduce long-term energy costs for South Carolina families and businesses.
Tax credits are not a new concept — they have been a bipartisan policy tool used for decades to support emerging technologies. From artificial intelligence to biotechnology, to government investments driving technologies like GPS and the internet, these investments have repeatedly demonstrated their value. Clean energy technologies are no exception.
In 2024, over 2,600 megawatts of solar energy capacity came online in South Carolina, equating to enough power to supply 325,640 homes.
Over the next five years, South Carolina is projected to add over 2,500 megawatts of solar capacity.
Retaining the existing energy tax credits will allow businesses in South Carolina to continue to develop and deploy renewable energy technologies which are vital to improve grid resiliency, promote greater efficiency that results in lower energy costs for everyone, and foster economic opportunities in our rural communities.
Energy diversification mirrors a sound investment portfolio. Just as diverse assets protect against market volatility, multiple energy sources safeguard against physical and cyber threats. In addition, if we’re manufacturing these technologies here in South Carolina, we are securing our energy independence by growing our ability to produce what we need at home and having greater control over our supply chain.
Businesses have planned with these tax incentives in mind and rely upon them for capital allocation, planning, and project commitments — all of which would be threatened by the whiplash of major changes to these credits or further restrictions.
We’ve already seen a taste of what this disruption can do.
Recent federal changes and uncertainty have led to an indefinite pause in the construction of the AESC manufacturing facility in Florence, a $1.6 billion investment that promised to create 1,600 jobs in the Pee Dee.
A full repeal of these vital credits would undermine significant progress made in clean energy innovation, economic growth, and national security, and likely cede jobs and progress to China.
Now it’s up to our elected officials on Capitol Hill to decide whether these clean energy tax credits continue as Congress intended in 2022.
These private and public investments will spur domestic production of clean energy technologies which will set the United States up to compete in the global clean energy economy and create thousands more in clean energy jobs that will benefit all South Carolinians.

(Photo courtesy the Indiana State Library)Indiana agencies have laid off dozens of state employees in response to recently enacted budget cuts — marking the first such reductions since Gov. Mike Braun signed the state’s new, slimmed down spending plan last month.
The governor’s office confirmed that agencies under both the education and commerce verticals announced staff reductions on Tuesday. The Indiana State Museum also let go of several employees last week.
State officials attributed the layoffs to the new state budget, which slashed operations funding for most agencies.
Courtney Bearsch, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Education, confirmed on Wednesday that 39 employees across four education-related agencies have so far been notified of a “Reduction in Force” (RIF). Those layoffs included:

16 employees at the Indiana State Library
14 at the Indiana School for the Deaf
6 at the Department of Education
3 at the Commission for Higher Education

“In the final days of the legislative session, our state’s leaders had to adjust the final budget to account for an over $2 billion budget shortfall. Like most agencies across state government, agencies within the education vertical saw budget reductions,” Bearsch told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “In response, we have had to make difficult decisions regarding our agencies’ operations to adjust to the realities of a much tighter budget.”
But cuts to agency funding predates the late-session budget shortfall. Braun’s draft spending plan — released in January — cut appropriations for the state library by nearly 30%, from roughly $3.7 million a year in the last biennial budget to around $2.6 million.
Original drafts of the budget similarly pitched nearly $1 million in cuts for the Indiana School for the Deaf.
Both proposed cuts were retained in the final version of the two-year spending plan.
Deep cuts within education vertical
Some of the deepest cuts so far appear to be at the Indiana Historical Bureau, a division of the Indiana State Library.
Agencies instructed to withhold funds on top of 5% budget cuts 

Five of the bureau’s six staffers were let go Tuesday afternoon without advance notice, affected employees told the Capital Chronicle. That leaves just one person to run the office, which manages 750 community-funded markers across Indiana as part of the State Historical Marker Program, in addition to various other public history initiatives.
An additional 43 positions across the education vertical will remain unfilled, for a combined estimated savings of $6.9 million in salary and benefits, Bearsch said. 
“This is not something that was taken lightly, and we are grateful for the work of each of these colleagues to serve our agencies and Hoosiers,” she continued. “Each agency’s unique budget and respective reductions determined the staffing adjustments needed. When possible, agencies prioritized not filling vacant positions, as well as leveraging other funding streams, rather than reducing current staffing levels.”
In the commerce vertical, the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) eliminated eight positions this week as part of a 12-person reduction in workforce across the vertical, said IEDC spokesperson Erin Sweitzer. Three additional layoffs were recorded at the Indiana Destination Development Corporation (IDDC), and one from the Governor’s Workforce Cabinet. Those layoffs followed earlier reductions driven by “natural employee attrition”— totaling 49 positions since January.
Sweitzer said 89 employees remain at the IEDC and eight at the IDDC. Altogether, the changes are expected to save $7.4 million annually — $1.5 million of which comes from this week’s cuts — and “align” the agency more closely with Braun’s strategic priorities, including workforce development and regional economic growth.

The staffing shakeups follow sharp reductions to some agency budgets. The state’s next two-year spending plan was approved by Indiana lawmakers in April — then signed by Braun in May — and will take effect July 1.
The IEDC’s operational and programmatic budget was cut by about 25%, from nearly $100 million in the last state budget to about $74 million per year. The state library’s annual appropriation dropped from roughly $3.7 million to $2.6 million, and the state museum’s from $11.2 million to $10.6 million.
Layoffs affect employees statewide
The total number of state employees affected by layoffs remains unclear.
But state data shows that the overall state workforce has already been shrinking in recent months. 
According to the Indiana Transparency Portal, the number of state employees fell from 32,212 in December 2024 to 31,513 as of June 10 — a drop of almost 700 workers.
Ivy Tech Community College recently announced it will lay off 202 employees statewide as it responds to significant cuts in state funding and frozen tuition rates.
And Braun’s administration last week directed agencies to withhold additional funds on top of 5% budget cuts already built into the $44 billion biennial budget passed by the Republican-led General Assembly in April.
The governor and other state officials have described the reductions as fiscally responsible and necessary for long-term stability. Democrats and other critics have warned, though, that the cuts are likely to interrupt — or end — numerous public services and state programs.

Testifying before the Senate Energy and Environment Committee, Sens. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township), and Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), as well as Rep. Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), underscored how the state’s current regulations have impacted Michigan residents, arguing that they focus too heavily on limiting exposure rather than cleaning up pollution, leaving Michiganders to bear the costs.
Last week, members of the House and Senate announced they would be reintroducing “polluter pay” legislation in each chamber, with House Democrats introducing H.B. 4636–4640 and Senate Democrats introducing S.B. 385–387 and S.B. 391–393.
“Some people are calling for a restoration of a model that requires strict liability and full residential cleanups on every site. In fact, I proposed legislation like that in the past. But that’s not what is being proposed today,” Irwin said. “What is being proposed today is a modest change that preserves the current risk-based system, but that makes modest changes to improve protections for our water, improve protections for our land and improve protections for our health.”
As a whole, the package aims to implement stricter pollution reporting and   cleanup requirements, extend the statute of limitations for citizens bringing claims against polluters and allow residents impacted by pollution to sue companies for the cost of medical monitoring, Irwin explained. 
With more than 25,000 polluted sites across the state and 4,603 sites with land or resource controls, Irwin questioned how many aquifers the state is willing to give up to pollution.
He also warned the panel that industry lobbyists would testify against these additional measures, arguing they would harm investment in Michigan business.
“Not only do I think that’s not true, but we developed these bills in consultation with industry stakeholders,” Irwin said, noting that the sponsors had held workgroup meetings on the policies introduced during the previous Legislative session. The end result was more modest, but would still provide real benefits to the public, Irwin said.

Andrea Pierce, policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition and founder of the Anishinaabek Caucus said these laws are the beginning step in addressing environmental contamination in Michigan, not the end.
Should these bills become law, Michigan would return to the pollution accountability standard it had before the state’s polluter pay law was restructured in 1995, Pierce said.
“We need to go back to stronger laws that protect the people and communities of Michigan. Michigan needs a comprehensive legal framework for strengthening accountability and real recourse from those who pollute in our communities,” Pierce said, emphasizing that Michigan’s most marginalized communities were also the ones most affected by pollution. 
Mike Witkowksi, director of environmental and regulatory policy for the Michigan Manufacturers Association argued shifting the system to require more from businesses would hinder the state’s brownfield redevelopment efforts. 
“These are not technical fixes or minor clarifications. These are fundamental changes that would undermine one of Michigan’s most effective tools for addressing environmental contamination and supporting economic growth,” Witkowksi said, criticizing the additional requirements and arguing the package would increase clean up costs and liabilities for businesses.

During his testimony earlier in the hearing, Irwin predicted industry stakeholders would argue that the legislation would hamper redevelopment by requiring polluted sites to be restored to pristine condition.
“That’s not what this bill does,” Irwin said, arguing that pollution already hampers redevelopment efforts.
With the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy lacking both the funding and the personnel to address the thousands of contaminated sites throughout the state, Witkowski said private-sector investors and developers are essential to cleaning up contamination throughout the state. Should these bills take effect, those sites would sit idle and remain polluted, he argued. 
Shink countered, noting that she’d served on Washtenaw County’s brownfield redevelopment board during her time as a county commissioner.
“I can assure you that it isn’t just private funds that’s cleaning up these brownfield sites. There’s a lot of public funds. That means the taxpayers, after the company has made its profit and maybe taken that profit out of state, the community is paying to clean that up,” Shink said, noting that the state is paying to clean up the former Federal Screw Works site in Washtenaw County. 
Alongside testimony from several environmental advocacy groups, the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy also offered its support for the package with Aaron Keatley, the department’s chief deputy director, noting that the bills aligned with their priorities for environmental legislation. 
Those priorities include transparency, ensuring predictable processes, securing assurances that companies will manage any releases of contaminants until the contamination is cleaned up, ensuring sites are redeveloped and streamlining the department’s cleanup criteria so that the standards match the science, Keatley said. 
“It is unfortunate that I look at you and I say I cannot tell you how many sites right now are managed by responsible parties, because they’re not obligated to inform me of their day to day activities to keep that property safe,” Keatley said. 
The committee did not take votes on the legislation.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The ACLU of Iowa has filed a civil rights complaint on behalf of The Satanic Temple Iowa, alleging state officials discriminated against the group by denying it permission to hold a winter celebration and ceremony in the rotunda of the Iowa Capitol as other religious groups do.
The complaint was filed with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission on behalf of Mortimer Adramelech, minister of Satan of the Iowa congregation of The Satanic Temple, against the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, its director, and the office of Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The complaint alleges the state illegally discriminated on the basis of religion in denying The Satanic Temple Iowa’s application to hold a winter celebration event in the Iowa Capitol’s rotunda in December 2024.



The complaint alleges the denial was in retaliation for The Satanic Temple Iowa’s three prior reports of discrimination.
Adramelech said Tuesday that state officials made a number of assumptions about his religion and used those assumptions to discriminate against his congregation.
“We are compassionate and caring human beings,” he said. “We have families. We are Iowans and we are simply seeking to exercise our right to freedom of religion.”
The temple’s application to use the Capitol rotunda specified that planned events would be family-friendly and appropriate for children. The events were to include a ritual, a costume contest, caroling, coloring and make-and-take ornaments.
The complaint alleges in denying the application, the state wrongly alleged the celebration would have included sex acts, gore, and similar content and was not suitable for minors.
In a written statement, Reynolds said that while the Capitol building is open to the public, the state’s event policy “takes into consideration conduct that would be harmful to minors.” Reynolds said the proposed winter celebration, “which specifically targeted children, would have been harmful to children and so (the application) was denied.”
ACLU of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis Austen said Tuesday that “it’s one of the foundational principles of our country, and our state civil rights law, that the government should not favor one religious viewpoint or belief over another, or treat its citizens worse or better based on their religion. That means, among other things, that when the government makes the public space in the State Capitol available for other religious groups to use, for example, a Christmas or Hanukkah holiday display, it cannot then legally deny the same right to other religious groups, and that includes our clients.”
Once a complaint is filed with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, the commission may choose to investigate and act as a mediator in the dispute. After 60 days, the party filing the complaint has the option of pulling the complaint and requesting a “right to sue” letter, allowing them to seek a resolution in district court.
The civil rights complaint is a separate proceeding from the lawsuit the ACLU of Iowa filed in April on behalf of the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers. That lawsuit seeks to compel the governor’s office to produce public records regarding the denial of the temple’s application for its 2024 winter celebration. That litigation is still pending.

(Photo by Ken Coleman for the Michigan Advance)Attorneys for three of the students wounded during the 2023 shooting at Michigan State University announced Tuesday a several million dollar settlement for their injuries, pain and suffering.
The settlement comes more than two years after a gunman opened fire at the university, killing three students and injuring five.
In a statement, law firms Grewal Law and Gruel Mills Nims & Pylman said the settlements – totaling $29.75 million – would bring closure to at least some of the survivors.
Nathan Statly was shot in the head, resulting in brain injuries requiring extensive medical treatment and ongoing care. He will receive $14.25 million.
Yukai “John” Hao was left paralyzed from the chest down after being struck by a bullet in his back. Hao will receive $13 million, with the university agreeing to waive tuition, room and board, and provide health insurance throughout the completion of his undergraduate and graduate degrees.
Troy Forbush was shot in the chest and suffered a serious lung injury, requiring surgery and extensive rehabilitative therapy. He will receive $2.5 million.
“Grewal Law and Gruel Mills Nims & Pylman are honored to assist in obtaining justice for these remarkable young men,” the firms said in a statement.
In response, university spokesperson Amber McCann offered condolences to the students injured in the shooting, as well as their families and loved ones.
“While the university cannot comment on any specific settlements, we truly hope reaching a resolution helps provide some measure of relief, support and care to impacted individuals and their families,” McCann said.

President Donald Trump announced the name would be changed back to Mount McKinley during his inaugural address. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)On Friday, the federal agency in charge of offshore oil and gas drilling announced that it will be rewriting its core regulations to replace all references to “Gulf of Mexico” with “Gulf of America.”
The change by the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management is only the latest in a series of actions by federal agencies, and a review of the Federal Register — the official journal of the federal government — shows most agencies have already implemented President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order, which instructed the federal government to replace the gulf’s name in official records.
That order also officially renamed Denali to Mount McKinley, the name used by the federal government between 1896 and 2015 for North America’s tallest peak.
In February and March, the domestic names committee of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names formalized the president’s order and a subsequent one by the U.S. secretary of the Interior about the Gulf of Mexico and Mount McKinley.
At Denali National Park, websites changed the name of North America’s tallest mountain within 10 days; it was listed as Denali on Jan. 28, and by Jan. 30, it was “Mount McKinley.”
The printed brochures took longer but are now updated.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which handles ocean mapping, changed the gulf’s name on ocean charts, and the U.S. Geological Survey changed the name in the Geographic Names Information System, the federal government’s core database. Even the agency in charge of the nation’s spy satellites altered its records.
As the Atlantic hurricane season begins, the National Weather Service’s National Hurricane Center has already updated its maps, and the U.S. Coast Guard changed its regulations in March.
Other agencies, including the BOEM, have taken longer to act. In late May, the federal agency in charge of pipeline safety changed its regulations.
More actions are coming, according to notices published in the Federal Register, the official daily journal of the federal government.
In August, the Federal Aviation Administration will change parts of its aviation maps to account for the new names.
Additional changes are expected in the coming months from other agencies and from states, which have been slower to act on the new names.

Hunger stalks the Green Mountains like a silent and stealthy predator. Two out of five people in Vermont experience hunger, according to Hunger Free Vermont. And the problem may soon get much worse.
The Trump administration has proposed sweeping cuts to SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, the nation’s largest food assistance program. The Senate is currently considering a budget reconciliation bill passed by the House that includes billions of dollars in cuts to SNAP and Medicaid. 
Up to 13,000 Vermonters may have their food assistance reduced or eliminated if the measure is approved. Many immigrants who are legal residents, including refugees and asylees, will no longer be eligible for food benefits, according to Ivy Enoch of Hunger Free Vermont.
To find out what this means to the people who will be directly affected by the potential cuts, I visited the largest food shelf in central Vermont, located at Capstone Community Action in Barre. The food shelf is open three days a week. When I visited, a steady stream of people of all ages came through the doors, quietly but gratefully filling grocery bags of food. Volunteers buzzed about helping.
Emmanuelle Soumailhan, coordinator for Capstone’s food shelf, said that the food shelf gets about 800 to 1,000 visitors per month, double the traffic it received before the Covid-19 pandemic. The potential for federal cuts has her concerned that “we’re not going to have enough food and we’re going to see a surge of people … (and) we’re just going to run out of money.”
Stephanie Doyle came to the food shelf to get food for her family. She said that her SNAP benefits did not cover her family’s food needs for the month. “You just can’t afford getting fruits and vegetables and all that stuff that you need to do to be healthy, especially when you have a child that you’re taking care of.”
Doyle wants to ensure that her teenage daughter is “fueled really well in school so that she has a chance to thrive and get a good education just like all of the other kids who have more.”
Leslie Walz, a retired school nurse from Barre, was volunteering at the food shelf. She was outraged by the prospect that SNAP funding would be slashed.
“I don’t know what’s going to happen to these people that are dependent on the food shelf here,” she said. “Many of them don’t have a place to live. They’re living out of their cars. They were living in motels. It’s essential. It can’t be cut, not if we have a heart.”
Liz Scharf, director of community economic development and food security at Capstone, insisted that philanthropy and charity can not replace lost federal funds. She is hopeful that the most draconian cuts will be avoided.
“I just hope that in the end we’re a country that decides to make sure our people are cared for, rather than giving money to the highest wealth individuals in this country through tax breaks,” said Scharf.
Disclosure: David Goodman’s wife, Sue Minter, was the executive director of Capstone Community Action from December 2018 to January 2025.

(Photo: Greg Childress)In a build-up to a massive military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to celebrate the Army’s 250th birthday, President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised soldiers at Ft. Bragg for their fearlessness in keeping the nation safe and promised the name of America’s largest military base will never change again.
Trump also broke news, telling soldiers and civilians attending the celebration that he will restore the names of all bases that were named for Confederate generals but changed by Congress near the end of his first administration.
“Can you believe they changed that name in the last administration for a little bit?” Trump asked soldiers in the crowd. “Fort Bragg is in. That’s the name. And Fort Bragg it shall always remain. That’s never going to be happening again.”
Fort Bragg, which was named to honor the confederate general Braxton Bragg, had been renamed Fort Liberty and some signs leading to the military installation still carry that name. The names of the bases  names for Confederate leaders were changed to reflect a more inclusive and representative America.
Trump said the original names will be restored to Fort Gordon in Georgia, Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Lee in Virginia, Fort Picket in Virginia, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Fort Rucker in Alabama.
“We won a lot of battles out of those forts and it’s not time to change,” said Trump, who planned to make the announcement Saturday but said he couldn’t wait. “I’m superstitious.”
Tuesday’s celebration under mostly cloudy skies and intermittent showers was well attended. Soldiers began to fill the grandstands hours before Trump’s appearance. Patriotic music blared from speakers while visitors feasted on food from nearby food trucks, giving the event a county fair feel. Occasionally, military helicopters whizzed overhead, drawing the attention of both children and adults.
The crowd cheered almost uncontrollably when Trump finally arrived, fresh from viewing military readiness exercises that included howitzer live fires and a jump by more nearly 600 paratroopers.
“This week, we remember that we only have a country because we first had an army,” Trump said. “The army was first.”
Trump’s visit comes as he faces criticism for deploying Marines and the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell protests over ICE raids on immigrants in that city.
The visit also comes days ahead of Saturday’s military parade to honor the 250th birthday of the Army and to celebrate the 79th birthday of the president. Army officials estimate 200,000 attendees for the military parade in Washington, D.C. Trump has faced criticism for what some call an ostentatious display, with some of the criticism coming from within the Republican Party.
  Veterans voice concerns about Trump’s deep cuts to VA 

As Ft. Bragg readied for Trump’s visit, retired Army major and Democratic congressional candidate Richard Ojeda  issued a statement calling out the former president’s record of what he called “betrayal toward veterans and military families.”
“As a proud veteran, I am disgusted to hear that Donald Trump will be standing on the sacred ground of Fort Bragg, shaking hands, taking photos, and pretending to care about those who wear the uniform,” Ojeda said. “Trump has no business showing his face at Fort Bragg, not after proposing 80,000 job cuts from the Department of Veterans Affairs and slashing services for those who have earned and bled for the healthcare they deserve.”
Ojeda’s comments come amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
Veterans across the state have criticized the Trump administration’s cuts to the VA. At a recent “Voices for Veterans” event in Fayetteville, a panel of veterans, VA employees and elected officials agreed that America has a moral obligation to care for members of the military after they have completed their service.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said VA nurse Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a member of the panel.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has defended the Trump administration’s planned staffing cuts, saying, “We’re going to maintain VA’s mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission essential roles like DEI officers.”
  Defending the use of Marines in LA immigration crackdown 

Turning from the celebration of the Army’s birthday, Trump attacked California Gov. Gavin Newson, blaming him and other Democratic leaders for the civil unrest in Los Angeles, which stems from the president’s immigration policy.
The president claimed the city would have burned to the ground had he not ordered California’s National Guard and several hundred Marines to Los Angeles to “protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of a vicious and violent mob.”
“It (Los Angeles) would be burning to day just like their houses were burning a number of of months ago,” Trump said, referring to the fires in Southern California earlier this year that destroyed more than 16,000 homes and structures.
Without providing proof, Trump said the “agitators” in Los Angeles are “professionals” and are well-funded.
“What you’re witnessing in California is a full-blown assault on peace, public law an order and our national sovereignty carried out by rioters … with aim of continuing  a foreign invasion of our country and we’re not going to let that happen,” Trump said.
Trump warned would-be protesters that he would not tolerate any disruptions at Saturday’s celebration in the nation’s Capitol.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth traveled to Fayetteville as well and spoke briefly ahead of Trump, pledging to rebuild the military by restoring the “warrior ethos.”
“We’re not a college or a university,” said Hegseth, who has degrees from Princeton and Harvard. “We’re not interested in your woke garbage and your political correctness.”
Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll boasted that the Army has hit recruiting goals four months ahead of schedule, signaling what he has previously said is a renewed sense of patriotism and purpose among America’s youth.
“It is undeniable that young men and women (are) joining the Army in greater numbers,” Driscoll said.
The U.S. Army has reported signing 61,000 recruits four months ahead of schedule. This year’s goal was more than 10% higher than the 55,000 recruits targeted in fiscal 2024, demonstrating a surge in interest and enthusiasm for Army service, the Army said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)In a time when the Legislature is trying to pare back the size of the state budget, lawmakers agreed this week to pump more than $29 billion into K-12 education, a $945 million increase over current year spending
Per student funding would increase by $142.74, to $9,130, under a plan House and Senate budget conferees agreed to this week, a 1.59% increase from the current fiscal year.
“It’s adequate, it’s historic, it’s all of the things. It’s really good,” House budget chief Rep. Lawrence McClure said of per student funding.
Much of the K-12 education budget increase, 71%, would be funded by local property taxes, Politico first reported.
Florida’s growing school choice program, in which state dollars can be used for private school tuition or homeschooling, has decreased public schools’ share of enrollment.
“I think we can all agree that the public school population is declining. The schools still are open and operating, so that expense is there, and if there’s fewer students being there then money comes from somewhere [else],” Senate budget chief Sen. Ed Hooper told reporters this week.
The spending agreement was made as legislators met in an extended session dedicated to crafting a budget for state fiscal year 2025-26, which begins July 1. The extension was necessary because legislative leadership couldn’t agree during the 60-day regular session on how much money to spend and ways to reduce taxes.
As part of the K-12 agreement, the  chambers agreed to allocate an extra $101.6 million toward teacher salary increases statewide, targeting an area Florida has lagged in. Last year, salary increase allocations went up by about $200 million. Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed about $250 million for teacher and personnel salary increases this year.
According to the National Education Association, Florida is 50th in the nation for average teacher salaries.
Accelerated courses like Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate were facing reduced funding under earlier proposals, but pushback from school officials and constituents made a difference. Ultimately, the programs are funded at a rate consistent with the current year, $596 million.
The chambers have agreed to infuse an additional $6 million into the Schools of Hope program. Schools of Hope are charter schools opened near struggling schools.
 Policy in play

While lawmakers agreed to extend the session to address the budget, they have found creative ways to use the spending blueprint to readdress substantive legislation that died during the regular 60-day session. That policy-focused legislation will be included in what’s called a “conforming bill.” Unlike the budget, which expires in a year, conforming bills make permanent changes to statutes.
As of publication, a K-12 education conforming bill had not been released.
The chambers have publicly discussed reviving a bill that died during the regular 60-day session to allow Schools of Hope to open inside persistently low-performing public schools or on the property.
Lawmakers are looking to adjust how school choice scholarships are reimbursed as more students use the option. Throughout the session, school administrators and legislators expressed concerns about how and when money is paid to scholarship recipients or schools, saying it was impossible to track where some students were enrolled.
“Obviously, the accounting for the scholarships has not gone well. We’re trying to come up with a way that the money does follow the child, the student, and instead of reporting quarterly I think we are going to report monthly,” Hooper said.

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderEvery Tuesday afternoon since mid-February, the busy intersection outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention becomes loud and crowded as allies show their support for the center and its remaining employees.
The rallies emerged after the first round of mass layoffs under the Trump administration and its campaign to shrink the size of the federal government, which has led to a large number of fired employees, funding cuts and the elimination of CDC programs.
Every week, retired CDC employees and people who have lost their jobs take to the streets to express their disappointment and share their collective fear for the future of the CDC. This week, about 20 current CDC workers used their paid time-off to join them.
By walking out of their offices, the group was able to share a moment of solidarity with the crowd. A few of these employees stepped up to the megaphone, saying they were scared to speak out. Most of these employees remained masked.
Tony Fiore, one of the many CDC alums in attendance this week, has been at almost every Tuesday rally. Fiore is part of a group of former CDC staffers who help organize the weekly rallies to show their support of their friends still working at the center.
“We thought we’d come out here every Tuesday and show some support, show some love to them, because they’re just getting hammered from all sides,” Fiore said. “They’re getting letters every week telling them they’re worthless government employees.”
Tuesday’s rally came only a day after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. removed each existing member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. This committee advises the CDC on who should receive vaccinations and when. His executive removal came with a pledge to replace the committee with new members of his choosing.
Numerous signs, including one from Fiore, expressed dismay over this decision.
Supporters gathered around three corners of the busy intersection outside the center holding signs high as cars, including some with CDC employees on board, passed. The signs elicited honks, smiles and thumbs up from many drivers.
Recently fired former CDC employee Rosemarie Kobau attended Tuesday’s rally with a sign pleading for the restoration of the CDC’s epilepsy program. After 25 years as a part of the program and 13 years as its team lead, Kobau did not expect to be spending her Tuesdays unemployed and begging for the continuation of epilepsy programming.
Kobau’s team previously worked to promote epilepsy prevention through prenatal care, disorder management and innovative intervention.
“We were supporting many programs and communities across the country and in partnership with large national organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation and the American Epilepsy Society,” Kobau said. “Now all of that work has been stopped.”
As the rally cranked up Tuesday, CDC supporters gathered in a tight clump outside of a nearby CVS where event organizers set up a stepstool and megaphone. Former and current CDC staffers recited their oath of office and then extended an open invitation for anyone to speak.
This invitation attracted both planned and impromptu speakers.
Kathleen Collomb, a retired CDC employee from the Office on Smoking and Health, said she did not plan on speaking. However, after listening to the testimonies of other speakers she felt moved to voice her concerns.
From behind the megaphone Collomb told the crowd that when Kennedy was asked about the number one preventable death in America, his answer was smoking. But even so, the Office on Smoking and Health was one of the many eliminated CDC programs.
“What did this man and DOGE do? They RIFed them and they vaporized the Office on Smoking and Health,” Collomb said, referring to a reduction in force.
The crowd responded with a cacophony of “boos.”
Before leaving the megaphone, Collomb asked a final question: “How in heaven’s name does that Make America Healthy Again?”
State Rep. Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat, joined a long list of passionate voices at Tuesday’s rally. Her message was delivered through rain as a storm moved in. Attendees opened umbrellas and put on ponchos as Draper spoke about her gratitude and support for CDC employees. She also criticized Gov. Brian Kemp for staying silent as hundreds of jobs continue to be lost in Atlanta.
“If there is something I have learned from my time at the Georgia Capitol it is that there is no change without demand,” Draper said to the crowd. “I know sometimes it can seem like you are yelling into the void. I know that, but let me assure you you are not. We are listening and we stand with you.”

If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 988. 
When transgender Americans experience discrimination — like being harassed or denied equal services and medical care — they’re more likely to have poor mental health, a new report shows.
“Health and Wellbeing: Findings from the 2022 US Trans Survey,” released by the Advocates for Trans Equality Education Fund on Wednesday, includes insights from surveying 84,170 trans adults across the United States.
The report doesn’t break down results by state, but the organization said that transgender Americans in all states and Washington D.C. participated in the survey in 2022. Questions covered general health and access to health care, transition related care, sexual and reproductive health, mental health, life satisfaction and happiness and substance use.
Ankit Rastogi, the director of research at Advocates for Trans Equality, said during a Tuesday press conference that the organization conducts the survey because “the best way to learn about trans people is to ask trans people.” 
“We need social acceptance and family support and the ability to live our lives authentically in public safely,” Rastogi said. “These are all means to create better health and well-being among trans people.”
Among other findings, the report shows:

Trans people who have supportive family members reported lower rates of suicidality than those without support. Among those with no victimization, 31% reported considering  suicide in the past year, lower than the 50% for those who were verbally harassed, 53% for those who were denied equal treatment and 63% for those who were physically assaulted.
Older Americans surveyed reported better health than younger respondents with 78% of those 65 and older vs. 60% of 18-24-year-olds rating their health as good or better.
About 84% wanted gender-affirming care and about 60% received it.
Trust in health care providers was higher in 2022 than in 2015, when the organization last conducted the survey, with half of respondents saying all their providers knew they were transgender compared to 40% in 2015. Many health care providers were supportive of their trans patients. early 3 in 4 (73%) respondents who disclosed their transgender status to their provider reported they felt treated with respect by at least one provider — higher than the 62% in 2015.
Despite greater trust in medical  providers, trans individuals still put off seeing a health care provider because they fear they’ll be disrespected. The survey shows this is true for 32% of trans men and 20% of trans women.
The fear of mistreatment isn’t unwarranted. The survey shows 47% of gender non-conforming Americans had negative experiences with health care providers in the 12 months leading up to their survey.

Olivia Hunt, the organization’s director of federal policy, said the survey results can offer policy makers and the general public a better understanding of what it means to be a transgender person in America. 
“Over the past decade, the idea of trans people has become something that’s more and more prominent in the media and popular consciousness,” Hunt said during the Tuesday press conference. “But unfortunately, to most people, including those lawmakers and policymakers that I and my team meet with so often, trans people ourselves are just an abstract idea, an idea that’s based on stereotypes and assumptions and often incredibly inaccurate pop culture representations of trans people.”
Involvement in advocacy, Hunt said, will help make “trans people real” rather than a composite of a stereotypical character.
And, she said, “having real, concrete and rigorous data about the realities of trans people’s day to day lives” helps to dispel misinformation.
“Trans people live all around the country. We’re not just a community that exists in some sort of abstract ‘somewhere else.’ We’re in every state and territory, in towns and cities from coast to coast, and almost certainly in every single congressional district,” Hunt said. “That’s something that I think is still not really there in the public consciousness.”

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)A former director at Washington state’s schools agency alleges the state superintendent fired her after she voted as a local school board member in support of barring trans girls from competing in girls’ sports. 
Darby Kaikkonen filed suit last week against the state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and Superintendent Chris Reykdal in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. She says Reykdal retaliated against her.
“OSPI fired a high-performing employee, a military spouse, for exercising the rights and responsibilities of an elected official in standing up for women and girls, a viewpoint which the state superintendent disagrees with,” Kaikkonen said in a statement.
A spokesperson for Reykdal’s office confirmed Kaikkonen stopped working there in March, but declined to comment further, citing personnel matters and the litigation. The state hasn’t responded to the allegations in court, as of Wednesday.
Kaikkonen was the agency’s director of student information before her termination in mid-March, according to the lawsuit. She had been there since December 2021. Before that, she worked for a decade at the Washington State Board for Community and Technical Colleges, including half-a-dozen years as the policy research director, according to her LinkedIn.
She also serves as president of the Tumwater school board, where she has been a member since 2019.

Tumwater, south of Olympia, has found itself near the center of the growing tensions between local, state and federal officials over how to handle transgender athletes in school sports. It’s one of several districts bucking Reykdal’s mandate to support trans students competing in the division that fits their gender identity. 
In March, the Trump administration’s Department of Education launched an investigation into Tumwater School District over allowing a transgender athlete from an opposing team to compete in a girls’ high school basketball game. The investigation appears to still be ongoing, a district spokesperson said Tuesday.
President Donald Trump has sought to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports through executive order by, in part, withholding federal funding for districts that “deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities.” 
Some local school officials say they’re in a bind: Either comply with state law and jeopardize federal funding, or follow Trump and risk punishment from the state. This week, California sued the Trump administration over threats to withhold funding tied to trans athlete participation.
Reykdal’s office faces a federal probe of its own into its clash with a Clark County school district over the district’s gender inclusion policy. Kaikkonen’s work focused on reporting data for compliance with federal education policy, according to her lawsuit.
The vote and backlash
The week before the Trump administration opened its inquiry into Tumwater, the school board took up the matter of trans athletes. 
At the time, the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association was considering two proposals related to trans athletes. The association sets policy for school sports in the state.
One of the proposals would have barred trans girls from participating in girls’ sports. Another would have created a separate division where trans athletes can compete.
On Feb. 27, the Tumwater board, including Kaikkonen, voted in support of those rule changes. The audience watching the meeting in person responded with boos. In April, the interscholastic association voted down the proposed changes.
In a later meeting, Kaikkonen explained her vote. A former competitive swimmer, she said the issue “pits one historically marginalized group against another,” transgender people and women. She said she “fully supports” the transgender community. 
“I see myself in this issue, and most importantly, I see girls who are currently living it and the complexity of what they’re trying to work through,” Kaikkonen said. “This is an impossible situation. These girls are faced with the same challenges that we all are, and that they can’t possibly stand up for themselves and share their voice and what they think is right without being accused of bigotry.”
“You want to know why the voice for girls is quiet, and why so few people speak publicly about it?” Kaikkonen continued. “It’s fear.”
At the time, a spokesperson for Reykdal said his office was “closely monitoring” the Tumwater school board’s actions, and floated a “possible formal investigation.”
A petition to recall Kaikkonen and other board members received over 1,500 signatures.
A week after the vote, she was placed on administrative leave from her job at the state, with no reason given, according to the lawsuit. 
Less than two weeks later, in a March 19 call with the office’s chief of staff, Tennille Jeffries-Simmons, she was fired, the complaint alleges. Officials didn’t explain why, according to the lawsuit, which says she never faced disciplinary action at the agency.
Kaikkonen was reportedly expecting to go on leave due to an upcoming deployment to the Middle East for her Army reservist spouse. 
“The termination came at a time when OSPI knew the financial and emotional hardship this punitive action would cause,” the lawsuit reads. “As a result of her termination, Plaintiff has lost an annual salary of approximately $137,000, including valuable health and retirement benefits. She has experienced reputational damage, anxiety, humiliation, and disruption to her family life.” 
The lawsuit alleges retaliation and wrongful termination. Kaikkonen seeks monetary damages to be determined at trial. 
Kaikkonen’s term on the Tumwater school board ends this year. She didn’t file to run for re-election.

Shrum resigned in February after more than three years as OSU president.
She resigned amidst questions regarding the university’s handling of funds from the Innovation Foundation. Auditors found that $41 million was wrongly transferred into accounts that did not correspond with their agreed purpose. 
Her resignation letter indicated a plan to return to OSU’s Center for Health Sciences as tenured faculty in July, per her contract.
She is separated from the university, said Lance Latham, OSU chief communications officer.
“Dr. Kayse Shrum’s qualifications in rural health care, education and collaborative system development are exemplary, and the Chickasaw Nation is happy to have her on board,” said Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby in a press release.
Her early work will focus on the planning and development of the upcoming Newcastle medical center campus. Shrum will begin full-time employment in July 2025.
Shrum earned a doctorate in osteopathic medicine from the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine.
She practiced pediatrics in Muskogee before joining the OSU medical school faculty in 2002. She became chair of the department of pediatrics, then provost of the OSU Center for Health Sciences and dean of the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine.
Shrum also served as Gov. Kevin Stitt’s Secretary of Science and Innovation.

GM hopes to assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year in the U.S., focusing on plants in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee.
In Michigan, GM will invest in Lake Orion Assembly in Lake Orion Township to begin producing gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks starting in early 2027. GM said that move would help the company meet continued strong demand.
GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck will be its location dedicated to bundling the Chevrolet Silverado electric vehicle, the GMC Sierra EV, the Cadillac Escalade IQ and the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV.
Other plants receiving investments include Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, Kansas and Spring Hill Manufacturing in Spring Hill, Tennessee.
“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” said Mary Barra, GM chair and CEO, in a statement. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs. We’re focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the leaders of the Michigan Legislature praised the move, saying in a statement that GM and Michigan have a long history.
“I am grateful to GM for bringing more auto manufacturing back home to Michigan, protecting thousands of good-paying, union auto jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Over the last few years, GM has grown their footprint in their home state, and I am proud that the state of Michigan has been a strong partner in helping them ‘build, baby, build!’”
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall, R-Richland Township, thanked President Donald Trump for GM’s investment.
“This is exactly what we said would happen when he unveiled his bold tariff strategy,” Hall said. “While other politicians were paying out billions to build EV plants with small job totals, President Trump took the smarter path to bring back gas-powered production that will put more people to work and do it without handouts. President Trump took a strong stand to bring factories back to American shores and punish companies that shed American jobs to move their operations overseas. That plan is working.”
In its announcement, GM gave no indication that the tariff strategy being implemented by the Trump administration was a factor in its decision to make the investments.
Regardless, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said the multi-billion-dollar investment would mean thousands of new auto jobs for the state.
“I am delighted by this news,” Brinks said in a statement. “Our hardworking and dedicated workforce, vibrant neighborhoods where people want to put down roots, and major advancements in economic policy make our state the natural place to make such a transformative investment.”

You can read more about the section here.

In America, the military does not enforce our domestic laws. America does not use the military to suppress peaceful protests, even if we disagree with the protests. We have always known that tyrants use the military against their own people. 
The use and misuse of federal military forces to enforce laws and basic order are deeply, and darkly, rooted in Mississippi and Southern history. The deployment of California National Guard troops by President Trump to “address the lawlessness” in Los Angeles is redolent of another century.
In fact, the last time such a deployment occurred, bypassing the state governor, was last century, in 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson activated the Alabama National Guard without the cooperation of Alabama’s segregationist governor, George Wallace. LBJ did so with good reason. Not only were state law enforcement officers not protecting peaceful protesters, they were the ones inflicting horrendous violence on the 600 protesters crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge at Selma, resulting in a massive number of injuries and four deaths.

In America, federal troops, including “federalized” troops, are not used in domestic law enforcement by law (with very few exceptions). This dates back to the post-Civil War era in the South, when federal troops were used to enforce the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because local sheriffs and police officers would not protect the newly freed African Americans. 
Mississippians, and most Southerners, hated the presence of federal troops in the South, and in 1878, a deal with the devil was made by President Rutherford Hayes to withdraw troops and to pass the Posse Comitatus Act. The deal effectively threw federal troops out of the South and allowed the white supremacists to suppress Black and Republican votes. One good result of the deal was the Posse Comitatus Act, which prevents the use of armed forces to enforce domestic laws unless expressly authorized by Congress or the U.S. Constitution. Posse comitatus is a $50 Latin phrase lawyers use to talk about a sheriff who mobilizes citizens to suppress lawlessness in the jurisdiction. 
Even though 1878 is when the prohibition of the use of U.S. military to enforce civilian laws was codified, it is an American principle that echoed through history back to the Founders. Why? The Founders had direct experience of British troops enforcing oppressive laws without mercy or appeal.
In a conversation with ABC News, Steven Levitsky, one of the authors of “How Democracies Die,” has stated that in the large majority of cases, autocrats justify appropriating military power to use against citizens by claiming “there’s an enemy within that’s more dangerous than our external enemies and that justifies the use of extra-constitutional measures.” 
There are limited, narrow exceptions to the prohibition of the use of military forces for law enforcement. A law from 1807, the Insurrection Act, allows the president to use military and National Guard forces to stop an invasion, threat of invasion or a rebellion. But the U.S. has not been invaded despite the Trump administration’s attempt to characterize illegal immigration as an invasion. Federal judges, including judges appointed by President Trump, have stated the U.S. is not being invaded. No invasion means that the president may not invoke the Insurrection Act.
As recounted so well in the book An American Insurrection: The Battle for Oxford, Mississippi, 1962 by William Doyle, President Kennedy federalized the Mississippi National Guard in response to violence occasioned by the enrollment of James Meredith, an African American, in the University of Mississippi. Kennedy ultimately deployed the Army’s 503rd Military Police battalion, the 82d Airborne and the Oxford-based National Guard Troop E to quell a riot that resulted when Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett and state leaders pointedly withdrew state and local police and abandoned the Ole Miss campus to rioters. That riot resulted in two deaths and injuries to over 160 federal officers, including 28 federal marshals who sustained gunshot wounds. Kennedy was justified in using the military. 
There is no invasion, no rebellion in California. Legal, peaceful protests are not reasons for the deployment of federal troops. If law enforcement in the state of California is being overwhelmed, the state can send in reinforcements from other cities, from the state Highway Patrol, or the governor can decide to use California National Guard. None of this was warranted.
The reason this must matter to Mississippians, and all Americans, is that our Founders had a reason to fear presidents who deploy federal troops against American citizens. If a president can wield military force against U.S. citizens on a flimsy or politicized excuse, he can suppress speech, lawful assembly and a host of other constitutional rights with impunity. Every dictator, every authoritarian, has not become so until he has gained control of the citizenry with the military. 
Some people might like the outcome in California, the suppression of the protesters, some of whom became violent. If that is so, you might consider how you would feel if a different president were using the military in Mississippi in a similar way, say perhaps Obama, Biden, Clinton, even George W. Bush. It should not matter which party is in power; in America, we don’t allow the military to enforce the law against citizens, even citizens with whom we disagree.
From a national and homeland security standpoint, there is another argument against using the National Guard for political reasons. The National Guard is made up of men and women who have day jobs, own their own businesses or punch a time clock, and they work to keep food on the table for their families. You can think of this valuable resource like a gas tank. Once you use it up, it is gone.
We need our National Guard for natural disasters and emergencies. California needs its National Guard for major fires, earthquakes and other emergencies. It should not be wasted on deployments that can be and were being handled locally. And the Marine Corps is needed to protect us from China and Russia. It is a misuse of the Marine Corps to have them on the streets of Los Angeles.
But the compelling argument is that presidents cannot and should not be trusted with the power of deploying the military against its citizenry without real constitutional justification. My wife is a retired school teacher who taught her students George Orwell’s Animal Farm, an incisive parody of Stalinist Russia. She would ask her students “at which point did the farm animals irreversibly lose control of the farm?” The answer? When the autocratic pigs grew the puppies into attack dogs to control the farm animals.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) It’s been one year since Congress allowed the program offering payments to downwinders to expire. Now, advocates are hoping the Senate will revive the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, as part of the “big, beautiful” bill. 
That includes Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who told reporters on Tuesday he’s “hoping something can get done.” 
RECA had been in place since 1990, offering payments to uranium workers and downwinders, people who contracted cancer from above-ground nuclear tests. For years it was criticized for being too narrow — despite studies suggesting the entire West was blanketed by dangerous levels of radiation during nuclear tests, downwinders in just 10 counties in Utah, as well as a handful of counties in Nevada and Arizona, were covered. 
And since the program expired last June, Congress has been unable to bring RECA back, stymied by spending concerns. Although the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley that would greatly expand the program, it hasn’t been considered in the House.

During a press conference in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, advocates called on Utah Republican Sens. John Curtis and Mike Lee to get behind an amendment to Congress’ budget bill similar to what Hawley has proposed. 
“There’s a real possibility that a RECA reauthorization and expansion could be included in H.R.1,” said Steve Erickson, a longtime advocate for downwinders. “But this will need the support of Utah’s congressional delegation, especially the full-throated support from Senator Lee and Senator Curtis. Without their support, the prospects for RECA are much diminished.” 
Neither Curtis or Lee’s offices responded to a request for comment. 
Dozens of Utah lawmakers call on Congress to resume payments to downwinders

When asked about RECA during his monthly PBS news conference on Tuesday, Cox said he’s hopeful Congress will find a way to bring the program back during budget reconciliation. Cox, along with a coalition of 41 Utah lawmakers, have previously supported efforts to expand the program, specifically Hawley’s bill. 
Hawley’s bill would expand the program to cover all of Utah and a handful of other Western states that weren’t previously included in RECA, while extending coverage to communities around St. Louis and territories in the Pacific that were impacted by nuclear weapons testing development. 
“We’ll continue to express support for that,” Cox said on Tuesday. “The repercussions of that above-ground nuclear testing in Utah are very long lasting and many of us had family members that have been impacted. So I think it’s still important. Utah is not alone but Utah was significantly impacted.” 
However, the governor noted there haven’t been any new developments in his talks with the congressional delegation. 
People who submitted their claims before the deadline last summer can still receive payments — but there’s no option for downwinders who were just recently diagnosed with cancer, or didn’t know about the program. 
“(We) continue to receive emails and phone calls from affected community members here in Utah who have received cancer diagnosis, asking where to apply and what to do,” said Carmen Valdez, a senior policy associate for the Health Environment Alliance of Utah. “It’s really discouraging to say that the program is expired and they can no longer apply, but they can contact their delegation about it.” 
RECA has always had bipartisan support. Originally sponsored by late Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, both Democrats and Republicans have since advocated for its expansion. That includes Sens. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M. and Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, who have lobbied with Hawley to expand the program. 
“This is not a partisan play by any means,” said Erickson.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-11 19:34:25+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal budget bill could threaten ‘HUSKY for immigrants’ in CT,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/11/federal-budget-bill-ct-husky-for-immigrants/,The budget threatens to financially penalize states that offer health coverage to residents regardless of immigration status.,"Connecticut officials remain committed, for now, to a program that offers government-sponsored health benefits to certain undocumented residents — despite federal threats against states that do so, as well as higher-than-projected costs for the coverage since its launch over two years ago.
The state’s program, often referred to as ‘HUSKY for immigrants,’ covers children 15 and under, as well as women who are up to a year postpartum. Children who enroll are covered until they turn 19. As of April 2025, roughly 15,600 kids and 3,200 women receive benefits through the program.
The federal budget, currently being negotiated among members of the U.S. Congress, threatens to financially penalize states that offer health insurance coverage to residents regardless of immigration status, even though the programs aren’t paid for with federal funding. A spokesperson for Governor Ned Lamont said he is “closely monitoring” the bill negotiations. 
“Governor Lamont supports providing medical coverage for children, regardless of immigration status,” Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesperson, stated in emailed comments, adding that Lamont will “work with the legislature when the final bill passes to act in the best interest of Connecticut residents.”
Traditional Medicaid provides government-sponsored health coverage to people whose incomes fall below specified thresholds. In general, the state splits the cost for enrollees 50-50 with the federal government. Outside of a few exceptions, including pregnant people and those in life-threatening medical emergencies, people without “qualified immigration status” are not eligible for such coverage.
Some states, like Connecticut, have chosen to launch Medicaid-like programs offering coverage to people who would qualify if not for their immigration status, including those who are undocumented — but also others, like asylum seekers, visa holders, certain legal permanent residents and recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. For these enrollees, the state bears 100% of the cost.
In fiscal year 2025, Connecticut will spend an estimated $30 million and $11 million, respectively, to cover children and women who are postpartum regardless of immigration status, according to a spokesperson with the state’s Office of Policy and Management. 
Pregnant women also receive coverage through the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, for which the federal government covers 65% of the costs. In the calendar year 2024, the program to cover pregnant women cost a total of $16.6 million, with Connecticut contributing $5.8 million and the federal government putting up $10.8 million.
Supporters of HUSKY for immigrants tout the community health benefits of reducing the total uninsured population and providing coverage to some of the state’s most vulnerable residents. They also say it provides much-needed financial support to hospitals, who must treat patients, regardless of their ability to pay. 
Critics say the state should prioritize putting the state’s limited resources toward the many needs of residents who are here lawfully. 
Connecticut legislators who support the program have questioned the ability of the Trump administration to regulate a program that does not receive federal funding. 
“This will have to be litigated in the courts, but it seems like a huge overreach for the federal government to tell states what they can do with their own funds,” Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, said during a press conference last month. 
Elizabeth Benton, a spokesperson for Attorney General William Tong, declined to weigh in on the legality of the measure, but said Tong would defend the state’s HUSKY program.
“Without commenting on various hypotheticals, you can be certain that if Donald Trump tried to harm Connecticut Medicaid funding, we would evaluate every possible legal option to defend our healthcare,” Elizabeth Benton, Tong’s spokesperson, said. 
As of last month, 14 states plus D.C. provided state-funded coverage for income-eligible children regardless of immigration status; D.C. and seven states extend that coverage to some adults, according to an analysis by the health policy research organization KFF Health News.
Kati Villeda, coalition director of advocacy group HUSKY 4 Immigrants, said if the federal government goes through with the measure, she’d like to see Connecticut take the Trump administration to court and retain coverage for undocumented residents, despite the financial penalty.
“We have the money,” Villeda said, referring to the current state budget surpluses. “We need the political will.”
Cost uncertainty
This legislative session, for the first time in several years, the Connecticut legislature’s Human Services Committee, which oversees matters relating to Medicaid, did not propose expanding state health coverage for people without qualifying immigration status, despite calls from advocates to raise the qualifying age for children from 15 to 25. 
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chair of the committee, said given the current federal climate, she thought it seemed important to focus on retaining the coverage Connecticut currently offers instead of fighting to expand it further. She noted, however, that she and other advocates and legislators want to see Connecticut eventually offer health care to anyone of any age and regardless of immigration status.
The program also faced another hurdle this session: The state didn’t know how much it was costing.
At the beginning of this year, the Department of Social Services was still trying to understand the program’s price tag in fiscal year 2024, which ended last June. Gilchrest said, for her, that was a key reason to postpone further expansion.
“It was slow going to get the accurate data from the Department of Social Services, and so it just didn’t feel like the time this last session to push for more when we really couldn’t accurately answer the question of how much the current program was costing us,” Gilchrest said.
The program launched in January 2023, initially covering children 12 and under, and demand far surpassed the state’s expectations. Officials had predicted 4,250 kids would sign up, but by April 2024, 11,000 children had enrolled.
In July 2024, the program expanded to include children up to age 16. By then, 15,000 children had enrolled, more than double the projections of 7,000 signups for fiscal year 2025. 
The state budget at the time allocated $11.5 million in fiscal year 2024 to cover children and $18.9 million in 2025. The coverage for children ended up costing $23 million in fiscal year 2024 and is on track to cost $30 million in 2025.
In November of last year, DSS began a review of the program’s enrollees, suspecting that some of them actually had qualifying immigration status and could enroll in traditional Medicaid. Following that review, the actual cost of the program in 2024 dropped slightly, down $2 million from estimates of $25 million in April 2024.
Villeda said even if the program costs a bit more than projected, it’s an investment in the community — and negligible compared to the $4.7 billion Connecticut is projected to spend on its share of the Medicaid program.
“That’s why we passed it and implemented it: to ensure that people are getting the primary and preventative care that they need,” Villeda said. “It’s a meaningful investment in the health of the community, the wellbeing of entire neighborhoods.”
Around the country, a handful of states, including California, Illinois and Minnesota, are considering or have implemented cutbacks to their programs to provide health coverage to undocumented immigrants amid higher than projected costs.
In Minnesota, the legislature passed a measure to end coverage for adults, though children would remain eligible. Governor Gavin Newsom of California unveiled a budget last month that would freeze signups for adults, though current enrollees would retain coverage and children could continue to enroll. In Illinois, Governor JB Pritzker proposed a budget that would eliminate coverage for immigrant adults ages 42 to 65 beginning July 1. 
Gilchrest said it was “disappointing” to see other states “so quickly turn their back on a policy.”
“Not only is it a human right, but it also makes fiscal sense, because as a state, we pay for that health care in other ways if we don’t cover it,” she said. “It’s my job as a legislator to keep beating the drum of how important this policy is.”
During debate on the floor of the state Senate last week, Sen. Ryan Fazio, R-Greenwich, proposed an amendment to the state budget that would cut Connecticut’s HUSKY for immigrants program to help fund reduced state income tax rates on poor and middle-class residents.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chair of the Appropriations Committee, said refusing medical coverage to undocumented residents wouldn’t save as much as some hope, since those residents would then be more likely to seek care in hospital emergency rooms, which cannot refuse treatment to anyone under state law.
Aside from the financial argument, Osten said cutting the program didn’t sit right with her morally.
“I guess I just look at children in the world as needing health care, and I think we should support all of them,” she said.

Andy Beshear speaks to reporters in Louisville. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — In the wake of tension between the White House and and elected officials in California, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky said that “violence is never acceptable” but “a chain of command” should be respected. 
Over the weekend, Republican President Donald Trump mobilized California National Guard troops in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ activity in Los Angeles over the objections of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. The president also ordered U.S. Marines to respond. 
Beshear said that “violence is never acceptable” when speaking to reporters following a Greater Louisville Inc. luncheon where he was the keynote speaker Wednesday, adding that Los Angeles police “should crack down and I know is cracking down on anybody who is breaking the law, is vandalizing and or is throwing things at officers.” 
“But as somebody who has had to govern through major protests, you need to have a chain of command where all the different groups can communicate with each other in law enforcement so that you can be effective,” Beshear said. 
Beshear mobilized the Kentucky National Guard during 2020 protests in Louisville against police violence. Ultimately, a West End barbecue owner David McAtee died as a result of a gunshot wound from a National Guard member, but no local police officers or Guards members faced state charges in the incident. Beshear initially called in the Guard to Louisville after seven people were shot during a protest. 
Beshear said his main concern “is by having a president call in a state’s National Guard without communicating to the governor about it at all, means you have different chains of command for the police, for the state police, for the National Guard, and now for the Marines, and that could be dangerous in the response itself.” 
“So what’s most important is that people are safe, that any police response is effective, that it prevents violence, but it cannot stop peaceful, lawful protest.”
The Kentucky governor, who is vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association, was part of a joint statement released by the association Sunday condemning Trump’s mobilization of the California National Guard.

The Democratic governors’ statement sparked a backlash from the Republican Party of Kentucky. In a Tuesday statement, state Republican spokesman Andy Westberry said by opposing “President Trump’s attempt to restore order and gain control of a dangerous situation,” Beshear is giving “the latest reminder that his delusional presidential fantasies matter more to him than what the overwhelming majority of Kentuckians support: public safety, enforcing federal immigration law, and standing with law enforcement.”
When asked about the statement, Beshear emphasized that his concern was that “a governor should be and must be consulted if a president is going to call out their National Guard” to ensure safety and allow peaceful protests. 
“If I ordered hundreds of state police into a county over the objections of the county judge, the sheriff and the police chief, I bet those same legislators would say I’m doing something wrong,” the governor said. 
In response to this story, Westberry issued a statement Wednesday evening calling Beshear’s comments “comical.”
“After his own inadequate response to violent riots and widespread looting in Louisville during the Breonna Taylor protests five years ago, how does Beshear have any moral authority to lecture President Trump on handling civil unrest — and what exactly would he do differently in Los Angeles?” Westberry said.
Republican Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman joined other GOP attorneys general on Tuesday in backing Trump’s mobilization of the National Guard in California.
“When local and state officials won’t act, the federal government must,” Coleman said on X.
In the days ahead, protests are being organized nationwide and across Kentucky to protest Trump who on Saturday will preside over a military parade in Washington D.C. It also will be the president’s 79th birthday. 
Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg recently said that the city would not “tolerate damage to property,” but some local protests so far have been peaceful. 
When asked about the Louisville protests, Beshear also agreed that they have been peaceful so far and that the Louisville Metro Police Department can monitor them. Beshear said that he has not heard anything from the White House about replicating the California order to mobilize the National Guard in other states in response to protests.

June 10, 2025 | Photo by Leah CraigCommunity members gathered at the Plymouth-Canton Community Schools Board of Education meeting Tuesday to voice their vehement support for the district’s inclusive policies and leadership. Attendance extended beyond the boardroom into the hallway. 
The outpouring of public support comes on the heels of a contentious May 27 meeting, when six individuals used far-right and religious rhetoric to lambaste the school board. Further examination of social media accounts showed that these agitators were flown in from out of state specifically for the Plymouth-Canton Board meeting. 
The individuals in question were paid operatives of Turning Point USA, a right-wing nonprofit that advocates for conservative politics in high schools and college campuses nationwide. Several community members pointed out that these six agitators were not stakeholders and, as such, were in no position to spread falsehoods about the school district.

Speakers at Tuesday’s board meeting chose not to say the names of the agitators, explaining that identifying these parties only serves to amplify their bigotry. 
Indeed, the meeting had a much different tone as district parents, students, staff, and alumni thoroughly condemned the events of the previous meeting. 
“They weren’t here to help our community,” said Michelle Mustakis. “They were here to use us, to use you, and worst of all, to use your kids for the purpose of growing their social media reach. Kids for clicks. And what better way for them to grow their influence than to hit on all the hot topic buttons?”
Though no specific policy was mentioned, the May 27 speakers’ inflammatory religious and political rhetoric was presumably a response to the district’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies. Per their website, the Plymouth-Canton district is “committed to fostering a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for all students, staff, and families.” This commitment is reflected in district policy, most notably in the district’s stance on transgender student rights.

In December 2020, the Plymouth-Canton board voted unanimously to allow  transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. The State of Michigan codified this policy in 2021, though the level of cooperation varies among school districts.
John Skutnik– whose three sons graduated from Plymouth High School– applauded the board’s efforts to “show our children that people who are different than them should not be feared but embraced and understood.”
Skutnik also pushed back on the agitators’ comments from the previous meeting, particularly the claim that schools should be focused on “reading, writing, and arithmetic.” However, Skutnik explained, “education is also about learning how to communicate. Because all of those traditional subjects are useless unless you’re able to communicate with people who are both like you and not like you.”

(Photo courtesy Daniela Marina Diaz-Ortiz)Last Saturday around 8 a.m., as she followed her husband to a mechanic in Albuquerque’s South Valley, Daniela Marina Diaz-Ortiz says she and her 5-year-old daughter watched, terrified, as federal immigration agents leapt out of four SUVs and pulled her husband to the ground.
“They stopped him and took him out of the car. They didn’t ask him for any identification. They didn’t tell him he was under arrest or anything like that,” she told Source in Spanish in an interview outside her home Monday afternoon. “They just pulled him out of the car, threw him on the ground, putting their feet on his back and head. At that moment, they also lifted him up by his neck and forced him into the truck.”
Jesus Jose Carrero-Marquez, 30, was hospitalized at the Presbyterian Hospital emergency room for hours, potentially due to injuries sustained in the arrest, his wife and others told Source NM. 
Agents who waited outside Carrero-Marquez’s room told hospital workers that the detainee was a violent gang member, according to New Mexico Rep. Eleanor Chavez (D-Albuquerque), who advocates on behalf of working conditions for healthcare workers across the state. Chavez said she learned of the arrest from a hospital worker and relayed to Source what the worker told her. 
Diaz-Ortiz adamantly denied her husband is violent or a criminal or in a gang. Source’s review of state and federal criminal records for Carrero-Marquez showed only a local traffic ticket in January. 
Instead, Diaz-Ortiz said he is a father and husband who makes a living as a Doordash delivery driver, while seeking asylum on behalf of himself and his family after being injured in a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro several years ago. The lawyer representing his appeal did not respond to requests for comment.
Diaz-Ortiz showed Source photos the family is using in its asylum appeal that show what appear to be injuries to Carrero-Marquez’s leg and back, which left him with a punctured lung and a limp, she said.
Source could not determine why federal immigration authorities arrested Carrero-Marquez on May 31; why they purportedly took him to the hospital; where he is being detained; or whether he’s been deported.
ICE offers Albuquerque immigrant reprieve — for now

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to questions from Source about Carrero-Marquez’s arrest, their alleged use of force or his current location. A spokesperson said the agency would respond but had not as of publication time after multiple requests. Source will update the story as necessary. 
Advocates, including Chavez and immigration lawyers, have tried since May 31 to find him, including enlisting the help of U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich’s office. A Heinrich spokesperson said the office had made efforts to find him but that “ICE is not providing timely or helpful responses to our inquiries.”
A recent change to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention policies has made it difficult to determine whether someone is in jail and, if so, at which detention center, said Sophia Genovese, a lawyer for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center who joined efforts this week to find Carrero-Marquez.
Following his arrest, Carrero-Marquez called his wife from detention somewhere in El Paso, Diaz-Ortiz said, and described severe pain in his head and back from the arrest, she said. 
The last time she spoke to him,  on Sunday, her husband “told me that they were taking him away, that he didn’t know where they were going, that he hadn’t seen a judge to decide whether he would be ordered to leave the country or not.” 
When she hadn’t heard from him again on Tuesday, Diaz-Ortiz told Source she felt certain he was gone.
“I believe my husband has already been deported,” she said, because otherwise, “I believe he would have called me.”
On Wednesday morning, Diaz-Ortiz said she woke up after a long night of making deliveries to check ICE detention records for updates, which she’s done multiple times a day since his arrest.
She discovered, and Source confirmed, he was no longer listed in custody as of Wednesday morning. And he still had not called her, she told Source.
“I still don’t know anything about what happened to him,” she said. 
“It just says, ‘Texas’”
Carrero-Marquez’s arrest follows the pattern of recent ICE detentions, which leave little trail for lawyers or advocates to follow, said Genovese with the Immigration Law Center.
After being arrested and hospitalized, Carrero-Marquez called his wife from his hospital bed, she said. But hospital workers would neither confirm he was there nor allow her to see or speak with him in the emergency room, she said. 
While the hospital would not confirm that Carrero-Marquez was hospitalized, a spokesperson said it has “Do Not Announce” protocols as part of federal patient privacy regulations and that patients may be under that protocol “for many reasons.” 
The hospital staff had no choice but to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, the hospital worker told Chavez, the state representative. A spokesperson for Presbyterian told Source that, while it cannot discuss specific patients, it is legally required to cooperate with all law enforcement agencies.
“We do not have policies designed to help or hinder any law enforcement or other governmental agencies,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement Friday. 
Confusion reigns in New Mexico’s militarized border zone

The officers took Carrero-Marquez to jail, likely to the Torrance County Detention Center in Estancia, Genovese said, though jail records never showed him being held there.
Diaz-Ortiz was the first person to hear from him, a few days after the arrest, when he called from El Paso, she said. 
Before Wednesday, when his name disappeared completely, ICE records didn’t say where he’s being held, and instead only said “Texas,” instead of a facility name and address. According to Genovese, he could have been held at either the El Paso Service Processing Center or at a nearby former Border Patrol holding facility intended for short-term use that ICE recently took over. 
The ICE takeover of the holding facility has resulted in confusion and difficulty for lawyers seeking to speak to their clients. It also means no one knows where detainees are being held. 
“This is like a new trend, where we’re seeing a lot of people have the exact same situation where… it just says, ‘Texas.’ It doesn’t provide a detention facility,” Genovese said.
‘Thousands’ of arrests per day
As for why he might be in jail in the first place, Genovese said ICE agents increasingly have less discretion about detaining people who, like Carrero-Marquez, are appealing denials of asylum claims. 
According to online records and a document provided by Diaz-Ortiz, a judge denied Carrero-Marquez’s asylum request in February. Records also show he is appealing that denial, and that the appeal is pending. 
While he has not yet received a final removal order, ICE has discretion to detain him during “removal proceedings,” his current status., Genovese said. 
That said, given the sheer number of people currently in “removal proceedings” with pending appeals, ICE typically would not find and detain people until a final removal order is issued, Genovese said. 
New Mexico sheriffs respond to federal ‘sanctuary’ list

ICE, “for very real capacity reasons, given the limited number of beds nationwide and the millions of cases pending at immigration court, frequently exercised discretion in the form of releasing people on their own recognizance pending their removal proceedings,” Genovese said
But President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportation has removed ICE’s choice about when and where to arrest people, she said. 
“It’s changed now under the Trump administration, where there is a mandate, a requirement, that ICE make thousands of arrests per day,” she said. “And they are targeting people with active removal proceedings, many of whom do not have any sort of interaction with law enforcement which would trigger mandatory detention.”
‘We came here for a better future’
Carrero-Marquez’s daughter recently celebrated graduation at a South Valley school. His wife shared a picture showing the three of them smiling, with her in a graduation gown. 
Since witnessing her father’s arrest, the girl is depressed, Diaz-Ortiz said, and afraid of anyone who looks like a police officer. 
Diaz-Ortiz doesn’t know whether ICE will come next for her or her daughter, whether she should enroll her daughter back in school or what to do next. But she still has to work. 
On Tuesday, she took her daughter along with her as she made deliveries for DoorDash, she said, suddenly the sole caregiver and sole income earner in her family. 
Amid the confusion and uncertainty about her husband’s whereabouts, Diaz-Ortiz said she is terrified about the prospect of him being deported back to Venezuela due to his injuries and the government’s repressive policies.
“In Venezuela you can’t speak freely or say what you want because they attack you,” she said. “We came here for a better future.”

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)GAFFNEY — Limestone University required students to pre-pay for summer classes. Now that the college has closed for good, some say they’re out thousands of dollars.
The school’s initial announcement that the 179-year-old, private college in South Carolina’s Upstate needed to raise $6 million to stay open came as online students faced a deadline.
On April 13, school officials told virtual students, including Mike Thielen, to submit their payments for summer classes within five days, according to emails reviewed by the SC Daily Gazette. The April 16 announcement of potential closure said online classes would continue, suggesting online students need not worry.
But after two weeks of frantic fundraising fell short, the school’s governing board ultimately voted for total closure. Online offerings ended too.
“That blindsided everybody,” Thielen said.
It’s been six weeks since the board vote. Thielen and half a dozen others say the school has still not refunded their money.
Limestone personnel designated as a point of contact after closure have not responded to emails sent by the SC Daily Gazette.
‘Total failure of leadership’
SC’s Limestone University to close after nearly 2 centuries

At first, Thielen received email replies from staff saying they were working on returning the $4,000 he paid for two classes.
He followed up several times and received the same response until layoffs became official and people stopped returning messages altogether.
“I don’t know if I’ll ever see my money again,” Thielen said. “Everyone is passing the buck. It’s just really shameful.”
Thielen enrolled in Limestone’s online program while working for a Spartanburg software company, which had a partnership agreement with the school. When he took a new job, he continued studying with Limestone, hoping to become the first person in his family with a master’s degree.
The online Master of Business Administration student, who lives near Fort Worth, Texas, and works as a healthcare recruiter, was just three classes away from finishing his degree. Now he’s left finding a new school — one that may not accept all of his transfer credits. And he’ll have to come up with more money to pay for it, on top of what he lost.
“It was just a total failure of leadership,” he said. “They rushed to shut it down and now they’re hiding.”
SC governor calls for study to consider consolidating colleges ahead of ‘enrollment cliff’

The story is similar for South Carolina Army National Guard member Thomas Martin.
The master sergeant from Charleston has worked for the Guard full time for two decades and was pursuing a bachelor’s degree in business on the side. Martin said Limestone’s online program was a popular choice among his fellow guardsmen because they could use federal and state benefits offered to military members to pay for it.
When Limestone’s final spring semester ended, Martin still had about $1,000 in state aid available, which he had hoped to put toward summer classes or textbook costs. The school, which received students’ allotment directly from the state Commission on Higher Education, has yet to credit him for those unused state dollars.
“I had a great experience with Limestone up until this,” he said. “Now they’re not even acknowledging my emails. It’s disappointing.”
Financial straits
Martin said he was repeatedly referred to South Carolina’s higher education agency for help. The commission’s staff told him they would research the matter but weren’t hopeful that the aid dollars would be returned.
Commission spokesman Mark Swart said the agency has not received any official, written complaints against Limestone at this time. He said the agency referred several students to Limestone’s former chief of staff, who the school designated as a point of contact.
Martin told the Gazette he didn’t realize the complaint process existed.
When Limestone announced the final decision to close, laying off 478 people employed by the college, leadership cited enrollment declines impacting colleges nationwide and rising costs as the drivers behind the school’s financial straits.
Limestone’s enrollment fell by half over the past decade, from 3,214 students in fall 2014, according to state higher education data, to 1,600 this semester, including both online and in-person students, according to the university’s announcement.
Auditors reported the school had a $7.6 million operating loss as of June 2024. To make up for losses, the school had borrowed some $22 million from its small endowment, which had a balance of just $9.2 million last June.
The school also faced an additional $30 million in debt, largely from a U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development loan, which Limestone took out in 2018 to construct a new library and student center, purchase a residence hall and refinance previous debt. The school offered campus land and buildings as collateral.
So far, USDA is not calling in that loan.
In a statement, a USDA spokesperson said it “takes its stewardship of taxpayer funds seriously” and “continues to actively engage with the university’s board and leadership to explore all available options to protect the federal investment and ensure the best possible outcome for the community and taxpayers.”
The school also has not filed for federal bankruptcy protections. No liens have been filed against the school in South Carolina district court. Nor are there any small claims filings from students at this time.
Other impacts
$500M for colleges, a bigger share for traditional public schools: How SC budget funds education

Not only does Limestone’s closure impact the college’s students, it also affected college employees and 13 K-12 public charter schools that relied on the college’s associated charter school management operations: Limestone Charter Association.
A former employee has filed suit in federal court alleging the school violated national labor laws when it only gave two weeks’ notice to workers. Federal law requires companies with 100 or more employees to give at least 60 days’ notice for layoffs, though there are some exceptions.
In its notice letter filed with the state employment agency, Limestone claimed the exemption allowed for employers actively seeking funding that an earlier notice could have jeopardized. The school has yet to respond in court filings.
Meanwhile, the state Department of Education is allowing the Limestone Charter Association, which operates as a separate nonprofit with its own staff, to continue operations through the coming school year as the charter schools it serves search for a new authorizer.
According to staff at the K-12 agency, the charter association will continue to receive state funding and act as an authorizer until July 1, 2026. It cannot accept any new schools starting July 1, 2025, and the state Education Department is recommending charter schools apply to a new authorizer by December.

(Photo by Save the Bay staff)Six months after state coastal regulators rejected a North Kingstown country club’s attempt to seek retroactive permission for a seawall built along its property line, the dispute — and the wall — still stand.
But maybe not for much longer. A unanimous decision by the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council Tuesday ultimately requires Quidnessett Country Club to remove the seawall bordering its northeastern property line within three months, and restore the shoreline to its original, pre-barrier state.
Robin Main, an attorney and partner at Hinckley Allen, representing  the members-only country club, declined to comment in an email Wednesday.
The 600-foot-long seawall overlooking Narragansett Bay was erected in January 2023, though coastal regulators didn’t catch wind of the violation until more than half a year later. Quidnessett quickly found itself in hot water with state and federal regulators and environmental advocates, who decried what they alleged was brazen and knowing disregard for state coastline protections.
The waters along the shoreline are classified as a sensitive conservation area, with permanent structural barriers like a rock wall expressly prohibited under state coastal regulations. The CRMC issued a series of fines against Quidnessett in August 2023, followed by a separate notice of violation in May 2024 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Facing financial penalties, the country club owners originally sought to ease development restrictions by reclassifying the waters along its coastline. If granted, the request could have allowed a permanent barrier like a seawall. After a protracted review and series of contentious public hearings, the council rejected the water type reclassification in January.

Five plans submitted, all unacceptable 
In the last 13 months, the country club has submitted five restoration plans, all of which coastal regulatory staff found “unacceptable,” according to a staff report by Brian Harrington, a senior environmental scientist for the agency. 
The council’s decision does not prescribe details of the restoration plan, instead deferring to Harrington’s recommendation as detailed in a 145-page report rife with aerial photographs, drawings and letters recapping the 18-month saga. In addition to removing the rock wall, Harrington recommended replanting native vegetation and stabilizing the shoreline using natural materials, including a raised barrier of compacted soil or stone, referred to as a berm.
The location and slope of the “toe of berm” situated between the shoreline and the golf course has been the primary source of disagreement between coastal regulators and Quidnessett. The CRMC wants the toe of the berm situated closer to land, following plans approved in 2013 for similar natural barrier protections. But Quidnessett has pushed for a barrier closer to the shoreline in order to avoid infringing on the 14th hole of its signature golf course.
“The line is critical for the club,” Jennifer Cervenka, an attorney with Cervenka, Green & Ducharme LLC also representing Quidnessett, told regulators Tuesday. “Based on the line being advanced by the CRMC, the country club will have to cut into its golf course.”
Cervenka chaired the appointed panel of coastal regulators until she resigned in 2021. Now on behalf of her client, she submitted a petition last month for the case to be referred to the agency’s hearing officer. The five-page motion noted the country club had requested an administrative hearing several times already, and that the contested nature of the case required a hearing officer to adjudicate the issue, as laid out in state law.
Cervenka referenced a January order by a Rhode Island Superior Court judge, who tossed a separate, 2020 CRMC decision on a Jamestown boatyard expansion. The judge in that case had ruled the council failed to follow its own regulations in bypassing a subcommittee review; there was no hearing officer at the time to take the case.
But Quidnessett owners and attorneys have admitted they violated state coastal rules in building the seawall — meaning this case is not contested and it does not require a hearing officer’s review, said Jeffrey Willis, CRMC executive director.
“This is a straightforward fact of the matter,” Willis said of the violations. “It’s part of the record.”
Coastal regulators denied the motion for a hearing officer in a separate, unanimous vote Tuesday on the advice of Willis and its legal counsel Anthony DeSisto.

AG: No more bites of the apple
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office also backed Harrington’s recommendations, urging the council to “expeditiously order” the removal of the stone wall.
“The CRMC has been incredibly patient with QCC for nearly two years and has allowed them at least five bites at the apple,” Randelle Boots, special assistant attorney general, wrote in a June 6 letter. “It is time for the Council to definitively and decisively act. CRMC’s good faith efforts to work with the country club have not been reciprocated, and there must be swift restoration of the property and real consequences for any continued bad faith efforts and delays that seek to protect a private golf course at the expense of the public.”
The council refused to let two engineering experts hired by Quidnessett speak at Tuesday’s meeting, despite Cervenka’s insistence that their comments were crucial to determining the restoration plan.
The CRMC instead opted to leave specifics to its expert staff, including where the toe of berm should be placed and the level of vegetation replanting required. Quidnessett has 30 days to submit a new plan, and once accepted, another 90 days to complete restoration work.
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, was hesitant to declare victory yet, noting the council’s decision lacked details on the restoration plan.
“Everybody walked out of that hearing a little bit confused,” Thorp said in an interview Wednesday. “I am still unclear how they are going to reach an agreement without being told what has to be in the plan.”
Also uncertain in Thorp’s view is whether the CRMC should have referred the dispute to a hearing officer. If Quidnessett successfully appeals on the grounds that the case demanded a hearing officer’s review, it will drag out a resolution even more, Thorp said.
“I am a little bit skeptical,” Thorp said. “I have seen this celebration before. I am reserving celebration till I see the wall come down.”
By Thorp’s count, Wednesday marks 653 days since the CRMC first issued a cease-and-desist order to Quidnessett ordering the removal of the rock wall.
CRMC member Kevin Flynn was absent from the meeting.

(Photo by Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)WEST FARGO, N.D. — The demand for jet fuel is going up. The demand for gasoline is going down.
That’s the simple explanation from Chris Ryan, the president and chief operating officer of Gevo, on why the company plans to add a sustainable aviation fuel plant to the corn-based ethanol plant it purchased at Richardton in southwest North Dakota.
Ryan said the low-carbon jet fuel won’t come cheap – throwing out a ballpark figure of $500 million for a potential project still years down the road.
Ryan spoke Tuesday in Fargo at the Midwest Agriculture Summit hosted by The Chamber of Fargo, Moorhead and West Fargo.

Colorado-based Gevo bought the Red Trail Energy ethanol plant at Richardton last year.
The Red Trail plant was the first ethanol producer in the country to implement carbon sequestration — capturing carbon dioxide from the plant’s corn fermentation tanks and pumping it into permanent underground storage.
The CO2 sequestration is key in lowering the carbon intensity score of the plant and for sustainable jet fuel production. Low-carbon fuels can fetch a higher price than traditional liquid fuels.
“We could make gasoline, but it’s a diminishing market,” Ryan said. “So jet fuel is a kind of sexy thing to talk about these days.”
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Ryan said there is plenty of room to add a jet fuel plant at the 500-acre Richardton site. He said the plant would add about 50 jobs, about the same number that the ethanol plant employs.
Expanding the ethanol plant also is a possibility, Ryan said.
The company also is considering adding wind turbines at Richardton to provide power and lower the carbon score even further, he said. Even though renewable energy tax credits are a possible target for budget cuts under President Donald Trump, he said wind energy at the site still makes good economic sense.
Gevo also has plans for a sustainable aviation fuel plant at Lake Preston in southeast South Dakota.
The future of that plant depends in large part on the five-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project that would take carbon emissions from ethanol plants to western North Dakota for underground storage.
Ryan said when the South Dakota project was conceived, it did not include carbon capture. But as construction costs soared with the COVID-19 pandemic, he said it became necessary to sign on to the Summit pipeline project. He said the federal tax credits for carbon sequestration would help offset the higher building costs.
The project has stalled as Summit has run into permitting challenges and a new state law giving landowners more power in easement negotiations.
“We really need the pipeline,” Ryan said.
He added that Gevo bought more land than it needed for the project. That is allowing for other projects at the site, benefiting Gevo and the Lake Preston area, he said.
The Summit delays spurred the purchase of Red Trail, which had the advantage of sitting almost on top of an area suitable for underground carbon storage.
“We had to take our destiny into our own hands,” Ryan said, and not be dependent on the Summit pipeline.
He said Gevo can “copy and paste” the engineering work done for the South Dakota site to the Richardton site.
While the carbon dioxide from the Richardton plant is being pumped underground, Ryan said Gevo recognizes that it has a potential for use in North Dakota’s oilfields, making oil wells more productive through what is called enhanced oil recovery.
North Dakota leaders have been trumpeting the economic benefits of enhanced oil recovery. 
Ryan said if the oil industry is willing to pay for carbon dioxide to use in enhanced oil recovery, Gevo would sell the CO2 rather than pump it underground.
“We don’t care where the revenue comes from, right? Today, we sequester it for a tax credit, and we can sell carbon credits,” Ryan said. “Or you can sell it to somebody for enhanced oil recovery.”
He said he sees it as another advantage of doing business in North Dakota.
“People in North Dakota get that, they understand the value of that,” Ryan said.

June 11, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)LOUISVILLE — Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg and Louisville Police Chief Paul Humphrey said the city should not be blamed for delaying a court order to correct civil rights abuses by Louisville police and to reform the department. 
During the monthly meeting of The Louisville Forum Wednesday, Humphrey pointed to federal “bureaucracy” while Greenberg acknowledged that “a lot of people … think that our administration and the LMPD was the reason” a consent decree mandating police reforms was not signed before the Republican Trump administration killed the agreement as expected. The mayor insisted that is not the case.
Responding to an audience question, Greenberg told the gathering that it took more than 11 months for the Justice Department under Democratic President Joe Biden to get the city a draft agreement after then-Attorney General Merrick Garland came to Kentucky in 2023 to discuss the police department’s civil rights violations. Greenberg said the city at that time offered to provide an initial draft of a consent decree. 
“They insisted that they would provide us with the first draft. Notwithstanding our weekly requests (of) when that draft was coming, we got the first draft of the consent decree 11 and a half months later,” Greenberg said. “So we waited basically a year to see a first draft of the consent decree after Attorney General Garland came to our city.” 
Trump Justice Department moves to end consent decree aimed at reforming policing in Louisville

The agreement was announced in December 2024, the month before President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term. 
In May, the Trump administration’s U.S. Department of Justice pulled back from the consent decree, saying such actions are “handcuffing local leaders.” 
The consent decree came in response to the 2020 police killing of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed Black woman, and a subsequent federal investigation that exposed a pattern of constitutional violations by Louisville police. Taylor’s mother criticized the mayor, Louisville Public Media reported in May, accusing him of “dragging his feet” on the issue. 
Louisville Metro Council member J.P. Lyninger, a Democrat, also has voiced disappointment with Democrat Greenberg’s administration. “The findings were announced two years ago,” he told Louisville Public Media last month. “If we had more speedily entered into agreement with the Department of Justice, this would already be on the books and we wouldn’t be talking about this today.”
A consent decree is a negotiated agreement that avoids a trial by spelling out requirements that a federal judge signs and enforces.
On Wednesday, Greenberg said, “Louisville Metro government was not the reason why this took time.” Instead, he said, the police department and city had “worked day and night with getting this done as their primary focus.” 
Humphrey agreed, saying there are “a lot of things that could be improved about that process” at the federal level to expedite the consent decree process. 
The federal government, Humphrey  said, was “more concerned with protecting the case than they were with improving the police department.”

On the same day the Trump administration moved to let LMPD off the hook for reform, Greenberg and Humphrey announced the city would move forward with its own Community Commitment, a 214-page handbook with goals similar to those outlined in the proposed consent decree.
“If we were using delay as a negotiating tactic, we would not have voluntarily signed the community commitment within hours of the Department of Justice announcing they were dropping the case,” Greenberg said at the Louisville Forum. “It would have been a very different response.” 
Under the Community Commitment, the city will issue a request for proposals (RFP) seeking candidates to fill the role of an independent monitor. The public will be able to weigh in on monitor candidates via an online survey and at community listening sessions. The independent monitor will cost Louisville around $750,000, Greenberg said, and will have a five-year contract. 
“We have our community commitment that we’re moving forward with, and so … looking back at what the federal government did or didn’t do is a waste of time, in all honesty,” Humphrey said. “Let’s move forward and …  make this community better.” 
The city has several listening sessions already scheduled where the public can weigh in on reforms. 
“I encourage you to be a part of the solution,” Greenberg said. “It’s very easy to criticize, it’s very easy to observe and talk to friends. We want (people) across the community to be a part of the solution.”

Dear Reader,
Affording a life in Vermont is becoming harder for more people and the consequences are real. From housing and child care to health care and food, many Vermonters are navigating rising costs with fewer options and more stress.
Too often, public conversations rely on averages that mask the realities many Vermonters face. At VTDigger, we believe journalism has a responsibility to go deeper and reflect lived experiences, expose systemic gaps and ask tough questions about what’s working and what’s not.
That’s why we’re launching a new reporting beat focused on wealth, poverty and economic inequality in Vermont.
Report for America is helping fund this new beat. But to fully sustain it, we need our readers to chip in for the remainder. Our goal is to raise $50,000 this year.
Thanks to a generous local donor, all gifts made by Saturday, June 14 at 11:59 p.m. will be matched dollar for dollar. Will you double your impact and help us launch this new beat?

Double your impact

A familiar name. A critical new role.
We’re proud to share that Theo Wells-Spackman will join VTDigger in July as our newest Report for America corps member.
Theo, who grew up in Weybridge and interned in our newsroom last summer, recently graduated from Princeton University. As part of the national Report for America service program — which places talented journalists in local newsrooms across the country to report on undercovered topics — Theo will investigate the economic policies and systems that shape life for Vermonters across income levels, regions and backgrounds.

Kristi Putnam discusses the state's waiver request for Medicaid work requirements on Jan. 28, 2025 as State Medicaid Director Janet Mann (left) and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders listen. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas State Medicaid Director Janet Mann will become secretary of the Department of Human Services next month as Secretary Kristi Putnam returns to Kentucky, the governor’s office announced Wednesday.
Mann serves as DHS’ deputy secretary of programs as well as medicaid director. She has over 20 years of experience in healthcare and healthcare finance and previously served as chief financial officer and director of the division of medical services for the department.
Putnam was deputy secretary of the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services when Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders picked her to lead Arkansas’ Human Services Department in 2023.
“Over the past two-and-a-half years, Kristi has overhauled the Department of Human Services and brought much-needed reforms to the programs her agency oversees, including foster care, Medicaid, maternal health, food stamps, and more,” Sanders said in the press release announcing Putnam’s departure and Mann’s promotion.
“I am grateful that we have someone as qualified as Janet to take over for Kristi and seamlessly continue to make positive changes at DHS,” Sanders said. “Janet has an encyclopedic knowledge of her agency and I know she is the exact right person to lead DHS into the future.”
Sanders said Putnam will be returning to Kentucky. Putnam said her “whole career has focused on serving families, and this move back to Kentucky is so I can serve my own family in a bigger way,” according to the release.
Putnam described Mann as “the absolute right person to step up as secretary.” The incoming secretary “is one of the most creative policy experts I have ever known, and will take DHS to new levels of success,” Putnam said.
Mann said she is honored that Sanders selected her and is looking forward “to continue the great work Kristi and I have been able to accomplish in this administration.”
As DHS deputy secretary of programs, Mann oversees the department’s divisions of aging, substance abuse and mental health, developmental disabilities, provider services and quality assurance, eligibility, child welfare and youth services, as well as Medicaid.  The department is the state’s largest agency with a total budget of about $11 billion, and its programs serve approximately 1 in 3 Arkansans.
Mann’s background includes a stint as the deputy administrator for Mississippi Medicaid and as a consultant to several states’ Medicaid agencies on finance, reporting, managed care, program integrity, organizational assessments and eligibility, according to the press release.  She holds a bachelor of science degree in accounting from the University of Alabama and is a Certified Public Accountant.
The governor’s press release said she, Putnam and Mann have worked closely together “to deliver transformational change to the people of Arkansas.” It cited Arkansas’ “welfare to work requirement,” changes initiated by the Governor’s Maternal Health Strategic Committee to support pregnant people and a foster care and adoption initiative that has reduced the number of children in foster care. 
The release also cited the state’s first-in-the-nation law preventing pharmacy benefit managers from operating drug stores in Arkansas and the newly approved ban on the use of SNAP benefits for soft drinks and candy.

And so I was aware of a lot of the facts[...]","Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins speaks to the crowd at the pro-gun rally in 2020. (Ryan M. Kelly for the Virginia Mercury)Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares is pushing back against President Donald Trump’s decision to pardon former Culpeper County Sheriff Scott Jenkins, saying the ex-lawman’s federal bribery conviction was well-founded and the pardon misguided.
“I have to authorize any state investigation into any elected official. And so I was aware of a lot of the facts at that time,” Miyares told The Mercury in an interview Tuesday. “Given what I know, I would not have pardoned him.”
The rare public break from Miyares, a Republican and rising star in Virginia politics who is seeking a second term this year, comes just weeks after Trump issued the controversial pardon in late May. The  president portrayed Jenkins — a longtime supporter who campaigned for Trump in both 2016 and 2020 — as the victim of political persecution.
“Sheriff Scott Jenkins, his wife Patricia, and their family have been dragged through HELL,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post announcing the pardon. He blamed the case on “an overzealous Biden Department of Justice” and claimed Jenkins had been “left for dead” by “Radical Left monsters.”
But prosecutors, a jury and residents in Jenkins’s own hometown paint a far different picture.
In March, Jenkins was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison after a jury found him guilty of accepting over $75,000 in bribes in exchange for issuing auxiliary deputy sheriff appointments and law enforcement credentials to wealthy businessmen and undercover agents.
None of the recipients were trained, vetted, or expected to perform any actual law enforcement duties. They offered Jenkins cash and campaign contributions. 
The appointments came with official Culpeper County Sheriff’s Office badges, identification cards, and in some cases, the ability to carry concealed weapons in jurisdictions where they otherwise may not have had permission to do so.
Jenkins, 53, was convicted in December 2024 on 12 federal counts — including conspiracy, four counts of honest services wire fraud, and seven counts of bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds.
“Scott Jenkins violated his oath of office and the faith the citizens of Culpeper County placed in him when he engaged in a cash-for-badges scheme,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Zachary T. Lee in a statement after sentencing. “We hold our elected law enforcement officials to a higher standard of conduct … and this case proves that when those officials use their authority for unjust personal enrichment, the Department of Justice will hold them accountable.”
FBI officials echoed that assessment. Stanley Meador, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Richmond Division, called Jenkins’s actions a betrayal of his badge.
“Every law enforcement officer takes an oath to serve and protect the community — that includes following the law they’ve sworn to uphold,” Meador said. “I am proud of the diligent work our investigative team did on this case to bring Jenkins to justice.”
Court documents showed that Jenkins accepted bribes from at least eight individuals, including co-defendants Rick Rahim, Fredric Gumbinner, and James Metcalf — all of whom pleaded guilty — as well as two undercover FBI agents posing as wealthy donors. 
In return, Jenkins appointed them as auxiliary deputy sheriffs and issued official law enforcement credentials.
In one instance, Jenkins pressured Culpeper County officials to support a petition falsely claiming that Rahim — a convicted felon — resided in the county, in order to have his firearm rights restored. The petition, later revealed to contain misleading information, was central to the government’s case in proving Jenkins’s abuse of power.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Melanie Smith, along with Trial Attorneys Celia Choy and Lina Peng from the Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section, led the prosecution.
Despite the evidence and jury verdict, Trump’s decision to intervene and grant clemency to Jenkins sparked outrage — even in conservative Culpeper County, where Trump won more than 60% of the vote in the 2024 presidential election.
According to NPR, which interviewed more than two dozen Culpeper residents following the pardon, all but one person expressed disapproval of the pardon — and the lone supporter refused to go on record.
“That’s a terrific mistake,” Ken Green, a retired entrepreneur and three-time Trump voter, told the reporter as he sat at the counter of Frost Café on Culpeper’s Main Street. “It’s a failure of our justice system. He was guilty as could be. He needed to go to jail, and he didn’t. So what kind of signal does that send?”
For Miyares, the issue isn’t Trump’s constitutional authority — which he acknowledges — but whether that authority was exercised responsibly.
“I think it is clear the Constitution gives the president incredibly broad pardon powers, as we have seen,” Miyares said in the interview. “And regardless of who’s in the White House, these pardons can be controversial at times.”
He added, “Clearly the White House is privy to facts that I’m not aware of, but with the facts that I am aware of, I would not have pardoned him.”
Miyares’s criticism adds to a growing chorus of Republicans what they view as Trump’s increasingly personal use of the pardon power. While presidents have long granted clemency for controversial figures, Jenkins’s case stands out because of the sheer volume of evidence, the jury’s unanimous verdict and the betrayal of public trust by a sitting sheriff.
“You’re scared. Honestly, you’re scared,” Jenkins said of his sentencing. “You may have been a cop all your life but you’re sitting here going, ‘They want to put me in prison for life.’”
Whether Trump’s decision will have political consequences remains to be seen, but the fallout in Virginia — especially among conservative voters who also value law-and-order policy— is still unfolding.
As Miyares put it, “I don’t agree with that.”

Kennedy Jr. makes remarks at a May 22 event announcing the MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Commission in the East Room of the White House (Joyce N. Boghosian/The White House).A new report linking pesticide overuse to children’s health issues has ignited a battle within President Donald Trump’s circle of support, pitting powerful agrichemical giants against some organic food advocates.
Last month, the Make America Healthy Again commission, chaired by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., published a report on declining childhood health metrics. One of the leading culprits, according to the report, was the more than 1 billion pounds of pesticides used annually on the nation’s crops.
“This administration has done something that no other administration has ever done, which is to acknowledge the impact of toxic chemicals and products in our environment and in our society that are contributing to our physical and mental and reproductive health crisis,” said Zen Honeycutt, executive director of Moms Across America, a nonprofit that has called for a ban on dozens of pesticides.
The organization and others like it have mobilized around Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again campaign. Referred to by some as “MAHA moms,” the coalition of health advocates has become fierce supporters of Trump.
While the MAHA report stated pesticides are commonly found in the bloodstream of America’s children — “some at alarming levels” — Honeycutt wished the report had gone further. She also believes the report downplayed the amount of scientific research already showing links between pesticides and cancer, reproductive health harm and respiratory damage.
“But what gives me hope is what Trump has said and what Kennedy is saying and what the science shows,” Honeycutt said. “If they continue to honor their word … and they acknowledge that pesticides are contributing to human health conditions, then the only steps to be taken will be to at least reduce the exposure of these chemicals to human beings.”
However, Trump is facing opposition to the report from another key constituency — farmers.
“It is deeply troubling for the White House to endorse a report that sows seeds of doubt and fear about our food system and farming practices,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation.
Pesticides — used to control weeds and insects — are used by most farmers.
The Farm Bureau and several agrichemical groups said any effort to reduce pesticide use would decrease food production and harm farm income.
“This report will stir unjustified fear and confusion among American consumers, who live in the country with the safest and most abundant food supply,”  said Alexandra Dunn, president and CEO of CropLife America, a national organization representing many large agrichemical companies, including Bayer, Corteva Agriscience and Syngenta.
Pesticide companies are in a position to push back on the MAHA report, especially after years of increased spending on federal lobbyists and political donations.
Bayer, the maker of the weedkiller Roundup, has faced an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its glyphosate product is to blame for thousands of cancer cases. In 2020, the company agreed to pay nearly $11 billion to more than 120,000 people who claimed the herbicide caused their cancer.
The company has increased its federal lobbying and political spending in recent years, and has also pushed for state-level laws that would shield it from further lawsuits.
Trump’s campaign and presidency have received millions of dollars in donations from the world’s largest agrichemical companies. The White House did not respond to a question about political contributions and its potential influence.
 Trump could further restrict pesticide use on his own

During Trump’s first term, deregulation was a central theme for both his environmental and agriculture agencies. His EPA overturned an Obama-era ban on chlorpyrifos despite science linking the pesticide to numerous childhood health issues.
In his second term, Trump has cut funding for scientific research at numerous agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Environmental Protection Agency is also considering a proposal to prevent states from requiring warning labels on pesticides, including glyphosate.
However, when the MAHA report was released, Kennedy attempted to portray the president as someone willing to further regulate the pesticide industry.
“(Trump is) blamed for giving money to billionaires, we hear about that all the time, but he is on the side of the middle class, the working class, the poor in this country,” Kennedy said at a May 22 MAHA commission meeting as the president sat smiling to his right.

“I’ve met every president since my uncle was president, and I’ve never seen a president (like Trump), Democrat or Republican, that is willing to stand up to industry when it’s the right thing to do.”
George Kimbrell, co-executive director of the Center for Food Safety, which has advocated for stronger pesticide regulations, called the MAHA report a “baby step” in the right direction and acknowledged the tone over pesticide regulations could be shifting.
“Going back my entire career, 20-plus years now of doing this work, it doesn’t matter if it’s a Democratic administration or a Republican administration, they have been beholden to and done the wishes of the pesticide industry,” Kimbrell told Investigate Midwest. “So, this is a unique moment where … there’s a chance that there could be some positive change in terms of responsible oversight for these toxins.”
While some pesticide opponents hope the MAHA report encourages congressional action, Kimbrell said there are several steps within Trump’s control.
The Center for Food Safety, along with several other organizations, has asked the EPA to cancel all registrations of glyphosate herbicide, after the agency failed to demonstrate it can meet the required Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act safety standard.
Dicamba herbicides are banned this year from over-the-top applications, but Monsanto and other companies have asked the EPA to approve them for next year.
“That’s a simple thing the administration can do, just don’t reapprove it,” Kimbrell said.
Pesticide opponents want to see policies and more funding devoted to organic farming practices.
However, the Trump administration has moved to limit farmer resources to organic and climate-smart practices, including the removal of climate data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website, which organic farmers have relied on. Following a lawsuit by the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York, the USDA agreed to return the data.
 MAHA report spotlights economic challenges in moving beyond pesticides

While spotlighting the dangers of pesticides, the MAHA report also acknowledged that “American farmers rely on these products” and that the economic impact of removing pesticides must be considered.
Honeycutt, with Moms Across America, wondered why the pesticide section of the report was the only one to highlight economic challenges with imposing new policies.
“It is understood that the farming industry needs to be able to operate profitably, but I find it counter to the intent of this report that this is the only section, out of the dozens of contributing factors to health concerns, in which this type of wording is being used,” Honeycutt wrote.
Pesticide opponents note that organic crop sales have quadrupled since 2001, topping $20 billion in 2021, according to the USDA.
Harriet Behar, a farm services consultant for the Organic Farmers Association, said she disagrees with the notion that farmers need pesticides to be profitable.
“We’ve figured out ways to produce high-quality and abundant food without the use of glyphosate,” Behar said.
For 35 years, Behar worked as an organic farm inspector. As she met new organic farmers, she would always ask why they chose to go organic.
“And the farmer would say, ‘My uncle died of cancer, my wife was a breast cancer survivor, my child had leukemia,’ ” Behar said. “They see the connection between the pesticide uses and they just didn’t want to continue, so they went organic.”

Protests in LA […]","Kansans rally at the Statehouse in Topeka as part of the 50501 national day of action on May 1, 2025. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State troopers are on standby in Kansas as demonstrations against federal immigration raids crop up around the country following an increased military presence in response to protests in Los Angeles.
The Kansas Highway Patrol is aware of Kansas City-area protests this week, said April McCollum, a spokeswoman for the agency.
Protests in LA began Friday, mostly in downtown and central parts of the city, in opposition to targeted, sweeping raids from federal immigration officials that result in the arrest and detention of immigrants lacking permanent legal status. The demonstrations escalated once President Donald Trump ordered thousands of members of the California National Guard to the city’s streets, against the wishes of state leaders. Protesters in dozens of other cities joined their LA counterparts Tuesday.
Col. Erik Smith, superintendent of the state highway patrol, told legislators Tuesday that a protest similar to those in LA was planned in the Johnson County area, but the agency did not disclose specifics when asked. The only report of a protest in the area Tuesday occurred in Kansas City, Missouri’s downtown and Westside, drawing hundreds of attendees, according to reporting from The Kansas City Star.
A slate of more than 1,800 protests are scheduled across the nation for Saturday. More than a dozen of them are set to occur in Kansas cities, from Garden City to Hiawatha to Arkansas City to the Kansas City area.
“We encourage those involved to maintain civility while exercising their First Amendment rights,” McCollum said.
The agency’s mobile field force is prepared to assist local law enforcement during all incidents of “civil unrest,” Smith said.
The force is “a specially trained and equipped unit composed of Troopers from across the state that can be deployed to support local law enforcement agencies in the event of civil disorder, natural disasters, and other public safety emergencies,” McCollum said.
Kansas Bureau of Investigation director Tony Mattivi told lawmakers Tuesday at a Senate Committee on Government Efficiency hearing that state agents are not currently trained to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials with raids and arrests in Kansas.
Sen. Mike Thompson, a Shawnee Republican, asked Mattivi during the hearing why federal agents aren’t responsive to one-off local arrests.
“ICE, right now, is just overwhelmed,” Mattivi said. “They’re focused on busloads at a time.”
State and local officials don’t have the authority to investigate federal immigration violations, but Kansas, was the second state in the country to agree with the Trump administration to exercise 287(g) authority, which refers to section 287(g) of the federal Immigration and Naturalization Act. Once agents are trained, they will be able to make those one-off arrests and fill the gaps federal immigration officials leave behind.
Eventually, Mattivi said, he would like to examine the 48,000 people who are listed as a sex offender, drug offender or violent offender in Kansas and determine whether any of those people are in the country without permanent legal status.
 
Politicians sound off
As chair of the Democratic Governors Association, Gov. Laura Kelly, along with most of the rest of the country’s Democratic governors, condemned Trump’s decision to deploy a state’s National Guard as “an alarming abuse of power” and “ineffective and dangerous.”
“Further, threatening to send the U.S. Marines into American neighborhoods undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust, and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement,” the governors said Sunday in a joint statement.
The Trump administration deployed around 700 active-duty U.S. Marines to L.A. from a nearby base to “restore order,” defense secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media post.
Trump called for California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s arrest after Newsom expressed his disapproval of Trump’s actions. Newsom sued the Trump administration, alleging the president’s takeover of the state’s National Guard was illegal. Governors typically hold the power to deploy the guard.
The Democratic governors said they stand with Newsom, “who has made it clear that violence is unacceptable and that local authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation.”
Kansas Republicans rebutted Democrats’ remarks with condemnations of their own.
In a series of social media posts, Kansas House Speaker Dan Hawkins, who is also a Republican candidate for state insurance commissioner, applauded Trump’s actions.
He said he was shocked by the Democratic governors’ statement.
“It’s indefensible that Governor Kelly and other Democrat Governors would seemingly side with the rioters over law and order. Their Trump Derangement Syndrome truly knows no bounds,” Hawkins wrote.
Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, who is widely expected to run for governor, criticized Kelly in a statement.
“Laura Kelly is slow to condemn attacks on law enforcement, but quick to side with Gavin Newsom and rioters waving foreign flags as they try to burn down an American community. It is shameful,” he said.
Conservatives in opposition to the protests have frequently used rhetoric that depicts L.A. in flames or in complete disarray. The protests have been confined to a few areas of the city, mostly around local and federal government buildings. Misinformation and doctored or fabricated photos have circulated.
Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, who is a 2026 Republican candidate for governor, wrote on the social media platform X in response to the statement from the Democratic governors: “This is wrong.”
In a separate post, Schwab said protesters in California were “endangering” law enforcement “because they embrace disorder and crime over civility.”
He added: “Our founders are rolling in their graves.”
 
Saturday protests
Protests in 15 cities in Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri, fall under the banner of No Kings Day, a collection of anti-Trump protests. Saturday is also Flag Day.
Ahead of the protest in Topeka at the Statehouse, organizers with the Kansas chapter of 50501 emphasized in a statement its desire for a peaceful demonstration.
“We are committed to the safety of every protester and are exploring unforeseen and uncontrollable challenges and how to respond to them,” the statement said. “We are continuing to plan for a safe gathering.”
Activists are chartering buses and establishing carpools to Topeka from Abilene, Junction City, Manhattan, Franklin County, Lawrence and the Kansas City, Kansas, area.
Ahead of Wichita’s rally, organizers with Defend Democracy ICT said the protest date is symbolic, “aligning with Flag Day, President Trump’s birthday, and a controversial military parade in Washington, D.C.”
“This is a stand against authoritarianism and the growing disregard for democratic norms,” organizers said in a statement. “We are here to remind our leaders that power belongs with the people — not kings, not billionaires, not dictators.”
Protests are scheduled to take place in the following cities, according to the No Kings online tracker: Arkansas City, Emporia, Garden City, Great Bend, Hiawatha, Hutchinson,  Lawrence, Lenexa, Manhattan, Ottawa, Overland Park, Pittsburg, Salina, Topeka, Wichita and Kansas City, Missouri.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5010895-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Another person has been sentenced for a crime committed while working for the state of South Dakota.
Renee Strong, 55, of Springfield, was sentenced Tuesday in Hughes County circuit court to serve five years of probation, pay $2,000 in fines and $466 in court costs, and perform 40 hours of community service. She previously pleaded guilty to four forgery-related felony charges for falsifying food service inspections while she worked for the Department of Public Safety.
The sentencing judge suspended two years of prison time on each count, meaning Strong will stay out of prison if she abides by the terms of her sentence.
“This defendant jeopardized public health when she forged health inspection records,” said Attorney General Marty Jackley in a news release. “Her actions also harmed the reputation of those state employees who work hard and take pride in public service.”
State employee charged with forging own medical marijuana card

South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation investigated the case, and the Attorney General’s Office prosecuted it.
The Strong case is among six criminal prosecutions Jackley has filed against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work for state government.
One former employee, Lonna Carroll, used her position at the Department of Social Services to steal nearly $1.8 million over the course of 13 years. A jury found Carroll guilty of grand theft, and she’s scheduled to be sentenced in July. Other criminal allegations against state employees have included creating fake vehicle titles to avoid excise taxes, the use of foster family food vouchers for a state employee’s own expenses, and the alleged forging of a state employee’s own medical marijuana card.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during this year’s legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor; strengthen the Board of Internal Controls; institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report; and establish protections for whistleblowers.
Gov. Larry Rhoden signed an executive order in April mandating the creation of a “secure standard reporting mechanism” for employees. The portal will deliver whistleblower reports of malfeasance to the state’s auditor and attorney general.
Lawmakers also passed legislation this year strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)A 30-year-old man from Randolph, New Jersey, was injured Tuesday by a bison in Yellowstone National Park, park officials said in a news release.
At approximately 9:45 a.m. in the Upper Geyser Basin at Old Faithful, a man was gored by a bison after a large group of visitors approached it too closely, the park said. The individual sustained minor injuries and was treated and transported by emergency medical personnel.
The incident is under investigation, and no further details were available Tuesday, the park said.

This is the second reported incident of a person injured by a bison in 2025.
The first occurred on May 7. There were two reported incidents in 2024 and one in 2023.
Yellowstone officials said wildlife can be dangerous, and people should give them space:

Wild animals can be aggressive if people don’t respect their space. It is your responsibility to stay more than 25 yards (23 meters) away from all large animals – bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose, and coyotes – and at least 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears, wolves, and cougars. If wildlife approach you, move away to always maintain these safe viewing distances.

Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.


Learn more about our safety tips while visiting Yellowstone, including how to behave around wildlife. The safety of these animals – and humans – depends on everyone using good judgment and following these simple rules.

The school aid budget reported Wednesday by the House Appropriations Committee would allocate $21.9 billion with $69.9 million coming from the state’s general fund, a 5.5% increase from last year’s approved budget.
Per-pupil funding in the House version of the school aid budget would be increased by $558 million gross funding to provide a $417 per-pupil increase, moving it to $10,025 per student.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
State Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township), chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on School Aid and Department of Education, said his subcommittee’s budget aimed to redirect funds away from the “expansion and explosion of categoricals” and to provide funding that Lansing Republicans felt was a “more than adequate amount of money to provide a quality education to every Michigan student.”
“We are hoping to have the performance that our citizens demand,” Kelly said.
State Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said the House school aid budget proposed funding that was higher than the dollars proposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in her executive recommendations released earlier this year and the Senate’s version of the school aid bills passed months ago.
The committee’s Democratic members, however, said they had several concerns.
State Rep. Natalie Price (D-Berkley) noted that the budget completely eliminates line item funding for the state’s universal school meal program. Price said that when kids are hungry, they can’t learn as well and do worse in school.
“I hear you saying that we want to improve education scores and we know this program has helped,” Price said.
Kelly turned and asked Price if she had proof on whether school meals actually helped student performance, noting his belief that student performance was better before the universal school meal program was introduced.
Price countered by noting that Kelly wanted to give districts the option on how they fund that program, but said that money will undoubtedly come out of classroom budgets, which she said would lead to lower test scores.
Bollin again noted that the decision on how districts move forward with school meals would go back to them as opposed to Lansing bureaucrats.
“Nobody wants to see anybody go hungry,” Bollin said.
State Rep. Donavan McKinney (D-Detroit) raised concerns about the cuts to at-risk funding. MKinney said without at-risk funding or afterschool programs, some children in impoverished areas with high crime would not even be attending class because their lives would be cut short outside of school walls.
“These programs saved my life as a child,” McKinney said before noting that the House school aid budget represents a major cut and completely zeros out funding for programs to help at-risk students. “There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t hear a gunshot in my community. So what are we doing? And what are the considerations that you are taking to cut these programs?”
Kelly was adamant that the school aid budget doesn’t wrap up at-risk funding, but said House Republicans wanted to “eliminate excuses, to try and provide as much as much money up front as we can to the classroom, the student, for the schools, to deliver what with think is a quality education.”
“We think it’s adequately funded,” Kelly said.
State Rep. Regina Weiss (D-Oak Park), who does not sit on the appropriations committee but appeared to testify in opposition to the budget bill, said she was alarmed to see a $2.5 billion hit in the House proposal to the school aid fund to fund other purposes, which she said is currently unknown because the House’s general fund and other government spending budgets weren’t yet completed.
She mentioned the House Democrats school budget proposal released Tuesday as one that adjusts for inflation and offers stability.
The Michigan Alliance for Student Opportunity in a news release said the House budget proposal for K-12 schools ignores student needs.
“The House Republicans’ education budget proposal leaves behind the most vulnerable students in our state and underscores the urgent need for Michigan to prioritize true equity in funding for students with the greatest needs,” said Peter Spadafore, executive director of the Alliance. “While we’re encouraged to see the foundation allowance proposal reach $10,025, the highest of the three budgets this cycle, that’s unfortunately where the good news ends.”
Spadafore also questioned if the plan, which holds at-risk funding flat, is a functional cut when inflationary pressures are factored in. More concerning for the Alliance were the targeted eliminations of certain programs designed to address unique student needs.
“The new categorical introduced by the House – which provides about $1,975 per pupil – might seem like a step forward. But it comes at the expense of targeted funding for student supports,” Spadafore said. “Without any increase in the [School Finance Research Collaborative]-recommended weights for students in poverty, English learners, or special education, this proposal fails to recognize the higher costs of educating students with the greatest needs.”
The House budget would also erase the Michigan Public School Employee’s Retirement System, or MPSERS, savings achieved last year, and shift school aid funding for classrooms that comes from lottery proceeds to universities.
“We know that funding alone doesn’t close opportunity gaps, but it is the foundation for smaller class sizes, mental health supports, wraparound services, and other resources that help level the playing field,” Spadafore said. “This proposal misses the mark by ignoring the fundamental reality that it costs more to educate economically disadvantaged students because of what poverty means in real terms. Our students need more than a flat increase; they need a commitment to funding equity.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/20250611_132508-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Joe Lombardo on Tuesday signed Reba’s Law, a bill passed in response to the death of a bulldog who died of heat stroke days after she was found in a sealed tote behind a Las Vegas business last summer. Reba’s Law increases the penalty for willful and malicious acts resulting in the death of an animal from the current maximum of four years in prison to six. 
Assembly Bill 381, sponsored by Republican Assemblywoman Melissa Hardy of Clark County, initially sought to increase the prison term to a maximum of ten years, but was amended. The measure almost expired in the Assembly after it failed to get a hearing before an initial deadline, but was resurrected after animal advocates applied pressure to lawmakers. 
Lombardo’s approval comes days after Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson, who complained the existing maximum penalty of four years in prison wasn’t adequate punishment for people who abandon animals, cut a deal with one of the two defendants. 
An investigation by the Current revealed Wolfson rarely seeks prison time  in cases involving animals. 
Markeisha Foster, 30, originally charged with one count of cruelty to animals, agreed to plead guilty to a count of attempt to kill, disfigure or maim an animal of another, according to court records. She will serve seven months in jail and is expected to be released at the end of the month on time served.  
The other defendant, Isaac Laushaul Jr., is scheduled to stand trial this month. It’s unknown if Foster is cooperating with prosecutors. 
“Reba’s Law strengthens our legal tools, but laws on paper are not enough without infrastructure, manpower, and training to support them,” Gina Greisen of Nevada Voters for Animals said in a news release, adding that cruelty cases often “fall apart due to inadequate or delayed investigations, missing necropsies, and an inability to determine cause of death early—leaving prosecutors without the evidence they need to pursue charges. If there is no timely, proper, and thorough investigation on the front end of an animal cruelty complaint, there is no case.”
The organization is calling on officials to support the laws with necessary resources. “That means funding trained cruelty investigators, prioritizing forensic veterinary support, and holding agencies accountable for enforcement,” Greisen said. 
Another provision of Reba’s Law provides criminal immunity to individuals who rescue pets left unattended in cars. Nevada law currently authorizes law enforcement or individuals to use reasonable means to protect a pet left unattended in a vehicle, and avoid civil liability. 
An individual rescuing a pet must ascertain the animal is in danger, notify law enforcement, take the most reasonable means to remove the pet, and remain with it until officers arrive.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1708574268-1024x750.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Inset photo taken by USDA inspector, courtesy of Bailing Out Benji)A lawsuit alleging the U.S. Department of Agriculture has failed to enforce animal-welfare laws in the state of Iowa remains at a standstill while the litigants wait for a judge’s ruling.
In September 2024, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals sued the USDA and then-Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, claiming the federal agency and former governor of Iowa violated the federal Animal Welfare Act by repeatedly renewing the license of Steve Kruse, an Iowa-based dog breeder. Kruse operates a large-scale breeding facility, Stonehenge Kennels in West Point, which has a long history of animal welfare violations.
The ASPCA claims the USDA routinely licenses dog breeders and dealers such as Kruse despite the agency’s direct knowledge of practices that violate federal regulations or fall far below the standards required by the Animal Welfare Act.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, seeks a court order that would force the USDA to void all current licenses issued to Kruse and his associates and prevent the agency from renewing them.
In response, the USDA has argued that any decisions as to whether to enforce the Animal Welfare Act through a license suspension or revocation fall within the discretion of the secretary of agriculture — Vilsack at the time of the Kruse case, and now Brooke Rollins of Texas.
By challenging past decisions to issue and renew licenses for Kruse and his associates, the USDA argues, the ASPCA is now seeking to “override the secretary’s discretion in licensing matters and impose its policy preferences on the secretary.”
Lawsuit alleges ‘horrific treatment’ of dogs
According to the ASPCA, the USDA’s own inspection reports detail “horrific treatment of breeding dogs kept caged in Kruse’s massive West Point, Iowa operation, which typically holds more than 700 dogs.”
The inspectors’ reports document observations related to dogs limping and suffering from open, bleeding wounds; dogs with untreated eye infections or severe dental issues; painful fur matting; and a lack of veterinary care.

The dogs pictured here were suffering from bleeding foot injuries and an eye disorder, according to federal inspectors. (Photo taken by USDA inspectors, courtesy of Bailing Out Benji)
The USDA reports also allege Kruse poured hot sauce on one dog’s open wounds to keep the dog from licking them, and housed other dogs in cages so small they restricted the animal’s freedom of movement. The dogs also had fecal matter on their coats and in their food bowls, the USDA inspectors alleged.
During one inspection, Kruse was alleged to have thrown a bag of dead puppies at a USDA official – but he has continued to operate his dog-breeding business under USDA licensure.
The USDA has not filed an answer to the ASPCA’s allegations, but in November 2024 sought a dismissal of the case. However, there’s been no movement in the case over the past five months while the parties await a judge’s ruling on that motion to dismiss.
In seeking a dismissal, the USDA claims the ASPCA lacks standing to sue the federal agency, arguing that the courts have only rarely held that individuals or organizations can sue for the unlawful regulation of third parties.
Citing past U.S. Supreme Court rulings, the federal agency claims an organization may not establish standing based “on the intensity of the litigant’s interest, or because of strong opposition to the government’s conduct.”
The ASPCA has responded to that argument by claiming the USDA has “previously relied on the ASPCA to assist with the rescue of hundreds of dogs when a previous associate of Kruse amassed so many violations of the Animal Welfare Act that the Department of Justice took the unprecedented step of seeking injunctive relief in federal court to halt that licensee’s operation.”
That assertion is an apparent reference to Daniel Gingerich, an Iowa breeder who operated a puppy mill in connection with Kruse and who was cited for more than 200 violations of the Animal Welfare Act before the U.S. Department of Justice intervened and negotiated the surrender of more than 500 dogs.
Such cases have a direct impact on the ASPCA’s ability to pursue its mission, the organization says, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars to assist with rescue and relocation efforts.
ASPCA: Feds knew of puppy laundering
Court records indicate that in 2022, the USDA approved Kruse for a three-year license despite what the ASPCA now calls “an extensive history of AWA violations” that included violations cited “on the very day Kruse applied for a license.”
Throughout 2023, the ASPCA argues, the USDA observed numerous dogs with severe veterinary care issues, including injuries, diseases, or conditions that had not been treated. In addition, the USDA is alleged to have “improperly approved” the licenses of two of Kruse’s associates in Iowa, Brian Lichirie and Wuanita Swedlund, despite “full knowledge of the relationship between the parties.”
That lawsuit claims that despite the Animal Welfare Act’s clear prohibition against issuing more than one license to a dog dealer, Lichirie and Swedlund each hold their own license while operating kennels that are populated by dogs owned by Kruse.
Technically, such arrangements are prohibited by the USDA since they can result in “puppy laundering” –- the process of routing dogs from a serial violator to a different licensee with a relatively clean record, in order to facilitate sales to retailers in the rapidly growing number of jurisdictions that prohibit the sale of dogs sourced from questionable operators.
The ASPCA claims the USDA wrote to Kruse nine years ago, in 2016, to inform him that federal law required him, Lichirie and Swedlund to operate under a single license.
When Kruse failed to take corrective action, the ASPCA claims, the USDA continued to renew his license and never took any steps to revoke the licenses of Lichirie or Swedlund.

A driver behind these changes is the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the name given to spending and tax legislation designed to advance the policy agenda of President Donald Trump. It passed the House on May 22 and is pending in the Senate.
The changes also would come from regulations the Trump administration proposed in March and the potential expiration of larger premium subsidies put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Millions of people might drop or lose coverage by 2034 as a result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Combined, the moves by Trump and his allies could “devastate access” to ACA plans, said Katie Keith, director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at the O’Neill Institute, a health policy research group at Georgetown University.
States that run their own Obamacare marketplaces and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners have also raised concerns about added costs and reduced access. But House Republicans and some conservative think tanks say the ACA needs revamping to rein in fraud, part of which they pin on certain Biden administration changes the measures would undo.
Senate Republicans must now weigh whether to include the House’s proposals in their own bill, with the aim of getting it through the chamber by July 4.
Here are four key ways Trump’s policies could undermine Obamacare enrollment and coverage.
More enrollment hoops
The House-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which runs more than 1,000 pages, would create paperwork requirements that could delay access to tax credits for some enrollees, potentially raising the cost of their insurance.
More than 90% of ACA enrollees receive tax credits to defray monthly premiums for their coverage. There are two key provisions for them to watch.
One would end automatic reenrollment for most ACA policyholders each year. More than 10 million people were automatically reenrolled in their coverage for the 2025 plan year, with their eligibility for tax credits confirmed via a system that allows ACA marketplaces to check government or other data sources.
The House bill would instead require every new or returning policyholder each year to provide information on income, household size, immigration status, and other factors, starting in 2028. If they don’t, they won’t get a premium tax credit, which could put the price of coverage out of reach.
Louisiana Legislature targets out-of-state doctors who provide abortion pills

“Everyone who wants to either purchase or renew a marketplace plan will have to come with a shoebox filled with documents, scan in and upload them or mail them in, and sit and wait while someone reviews and confirms them,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.
She and other policy experts fear that many consumers will become uninsured because they don’t understand the requirements or find them burdensome. If too many young and healthy people, for example, decide it’s not worth the hassle, that could leave more older and sicker people for ACA insurers to cover — potentially raising premiums for everyone.
But supporters of the House bill say the current approach needs changing because it is vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse.
“This would ensure that enrollees need to return to the exchange to update their information and obtain an updated eligibility determination for a subsidy — best protecting the public against excess subsidies paid to insurers that can never be recovered,” the conservative Paragon Institute wrote in an April letter to top Department of Health and Human Services officials.
Having a baby? Getting married? Expect coverage delays
Today, people who experience life changes — losing a job, getting married or divorced, or having a baby, for instance — are considered provisionally eligible for tax credits to reduce their premiums if they sign up or change their ACA plans. That means they would be eligible to receive these subsidies for at least 90 days while their applications are checked against government data or other sources, or marketplaces follow up with requests for additional information.
The House bill would end that, requiring documentation before receiving tax credits. That could create particular hardship for new parents, who can’t confirm that babies are eligible for premium subsidies until they receive Social Security numbers weeks after they’re born.
Policy experts following the debate “did not expect the end to provisional eligibility,” Corlette said. “I don’t know what the reaction in the Senate will be, as I’m not sure everyone understands the full implications of these provisions because they are so new.”
It can take up to six weeks for the Social Security Administration to process a number for a newborn, and an additional two weeks for parents to get the card, according to a white paper that analyzed provisions of the House bill and was co-authored by Jason Levitis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and Christen Linke Young, a visiting fellow with Brookings’ Center on Health Policy.
Without a Social Security number, any application to add a newborn to an ACA policy would automatically generate a hold on premium tax credits for that family, they wrote — increasing their out-of-pocket costs, at least temporarily.
“It puts consumers on the hook for any delays the marketplace is taking,” while the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which administers the ACA marketplaces, “is cutting staff and adding a lot more paperwork to burden the staff they have,” Levitis said.
Provisions in the House bill that would require ACA enrollees to provide information each year that they reenroll — or when seeking to add or change a policy due to a life circumstance — would increase the number of people without health insurance by 700,000 in 2034, according to the latest CBO estimate.
Less time to sign up
The House bill would turn into law a Trump proposal to shorten the ACA open enrollment period. The start date would continue to be Nov. 1. But the window would be shortened by about a month, with an end date of Dec. 15. This affects people in states that use the federal marketplace as well as the 19 states and the District of Columbia that run their own, most of which offer open enrollment into at least mid-January.
Also, as soon as the end of this year, a special enrollment period the Biden administration created would be done away with. It allowed people with lower incomes — those who earn up to 1.5 times the 2024 federal poverty level, or about $38,730 for a family of three — to sign up anytime during the year.
Critics, including the Paragon Institute, argue that this enrollment opening led to fraud, partly blaming it for a steep increase last year in instances of insurance agents seeking commissions by enrolling or switching consumers into plans without their consent, or fudging their incomes to qualify them for tax credits so large they paid no monthly premiums at all.
But supporters — including some states that run their own ACA exchange — say there are other ways to address fraud.
“We anticipate that much of the improper activity can be prevented by security and integrity upgrades to the federal marketplace, which we understand the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is implementing,” the National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote in a May 29 letter to congressional leaders.
Premiums, out-of-pocket costs likely to increase
The reason? Enhanced tax credits created during the pandemic expire at the end of the year. The House bill doesn’t extend them. Those more generous payments are credited with helping double ACA enrollment since 2020.
The CBO estimates that extending the subsidies would cost $335 billion over 10 years. The House bill instead funds an extension of Trump’s tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier families.
If the enhanced credits are allowed to expire, not only would premium subsidies be smaller for many people, but there would also be an abrupt eligibility cutoff — an income cliff — for households above four times the federal poverty rate, or about $103,280 for a family of three for this plan year.
Taking into account the smaller subsidies and the cliff, KFF estimates a national average premium increase of 75% for enrollees if the enhanced subsidies expire. The CBO expects that about 4.2 million more people will be uninsured in 2034 as a result.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file)Georgia’s Charlton County is set to become home to the largest immigrant detention facility in the United States following an agreement between county officials and the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Under a $47 million contract reached Friday by county and federal government officials, the D. Ray James Correctional Facility in Folkston, 45 miles southwest of Brunswick, will be merged with an immigrant processing center in the city that is operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Coastal Georgia Congressman Earl “Buddy” Carter, who said he helped broker the contract, praised the deal.
The expansion will add “roughly 400 jobs and economic growth to the First Congressional District,” Carter said in a press release.
Continued Carter, who last month announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Jon Ossoff: “I’m proud to have worked with Charlton County to get the D. Ray James Correctional Facility expansion over the finish line, which will bring jobs and economic growth to our region, and I will continue to support our brave ICE agents as they seek to restore law and order.”
Folkston, a city of about 4,500 people, will also receive approximately $600,000 a year in revenue from water and sewer services to the facility, the congressman said.
The Folkston processing center currently holds just over 1,100 beds. Its merger with the correctional facility will bring the center’s total capacity to nearly 3,000 beds.
In a June 5 press release from the county’s Board of Commissioners, County Administrator Glenn Hull said the county does not manage the correctional facility and would not do so following the merger.
“This expansion would increase capacity and enhance federal operations already in place,” Hull wrote in the press release. “Charlton County’s role remains strictly administrative and supportive.”
Both facilities are owned and managed by The Geo Group, a private prison corporation. The Geo Group contributed $7,500 to Carter’s campaign in 2024 through PACs, $5,000 of which was donated directly to Buddy PAC — Carter’s Leadership PAC.

That program, and other parts of the FBI’s Quantico facilities, including the bureau’s laboratory division, would remain at the sprawling campus in Northern Virginia under FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino’s proposed pilot plan, people familiar with the discussions told the newspaper.
An FBI spokesperson said in a statement to States Newsroom that new facilities would be chosen based on cost and utility. Messages seeking comment were left Wednesday with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency; Gov. Kay Ivey; U.S. Sens. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, and Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama and U.S. Rep. Dale Strong, R-Huntsville were left on Wednesday morning. 
Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that Congress should be “deeply skeptical of any plan to uproot the FBI’s National Academy from its longtime home at Quantico and relocate it to Huntsville.”
“This move raises serious questions, starting with why such a relocation is even necessary, and at what cost?” the statement said. “Quantico is co-located with other critical FBI and national security assets and before we spend taxpayer dollars on a disruptive and potentially unnecessary move, the Bureau owes Congress and the American people a clear justification for this plan.”
In a statement, Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle said the city would welcome the FBI.
“Expanding law enforcement training capabilities at Redstone Arsenal has long been a part of the FBI’s master plan,” the statement said. “We look forward to welcoming more trainees to Huntsville.”
The FBI moved an explosives training academy to Huntsville in 2016 and employed about 1,500 people in the city at the start of 2023. Republicans in Congress have named the city as a possible place for a new FBI headquarters, claiming the FBI’s current location exposes it to political influence and leads to duplicated services.  
The push to move the National Academy to Huntsville has drawn criticism from some FBI personnel, who see little justification for the potentially costly move, the people told the Post. The FBI’s training facilities at Quantico were recently upgraded, and the people familiar with the discussions said critics do not think Huntsville would have comparable facilities without significant new funding.
President Donald Trump’s pick for the FBI’s director Kash Patel, has said that he would move up to 1,500 staff and agents out of the FBI’s downtown Washington headquarters to satellite offices across the country. Five hundred of those employees would go to Redstone Arsenal, the bureau’s large satellite headquarters in Huntsville.

Vermont has joined 27 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit aimed at blocking the recently bankrupt genetic testing company 23andMe’s proposed sale of its assets, including consumers’ sensitive personal data.
The information — including DNA data, biological samples and medical records — of roughly 15 million 23andMe customers without their informed consent is at risk of being auctioned off as part of the company’s bankruptcy sale. The states’ lawsuit seeks to prevent the misuse of sensitive data, arguing that genetic information cannot be sold without expressed consent from consumers, according to a Tuesday press release from the Vermont Attorney General’s Office.

“Genetic information is some of the most sensitive information a company can hold about a person,” Attorney General Charity Clark said in the release. “Vermonters’ genetic information shouldn’t be up for sale without their consent.”
Once valued at $6 billion, 23andMe filed for bankruptcy protection in March after declining consumer demand and a major 2023 breach of nearly 7 million users’ data, which resulted in a $30 million class‑action settlement, Reuters reported.
The Attorney General’s Office was not immediately available for comment Wednesday.

One year after highway collapsed, severing vital commuter route, WYDOT completes 'Big Fill.'
The post Final fix for Teton Pass landslide will require a weekend closure appeared first on WyoFile .","Closing Wyoming’s busiest two-lane highway for two-and-a-half days during the height of the summer tourism season will disrupt travel for thousands of commuters and visitors who rely on Teton Pass. But the alternative would be worse. 
“You never want to close the road, but a two-day closure has a lot less impact on everyone,” said Bob Hammond, resident engineer with the Wyoming Department of Transportation. WYDOT plans to close the road to traffic during the weekend of June 21. 
Without the closure, work needed to finish fixing the “Big Fill” landslide — last year’s catastrophic failure of a 30-yard chunk of Wyoming Highway 22 over the steep mountain pass — could stretch over 10 days or more. Keeping the road open during construction would mean resorting to one, alternating lane of travel. 
“It would just back up horribly,” Hammond said of the traffic that would result. 
During peak traffic hours, delays could be so substantial that motorists might opt for the longer detour anyway. When the mountain pass closes, commuters from the Idaho side of the Teton Range, where housing is cheaper than Jackson Hole, typically re-route their daily travel through Swan Valley, Alpine and the Snake River Canyon. That adds roughly 1 hour and 6 minutes to what is usually a 24-mile and 32-minute drive.

Community stakeholders have generally agreed that it’s best to end the disruption quickly, said Stephanie Harsha, a WYDOT public relations specialist who has been working with Teton County organizations to get the word out about the closure slated for 6 p.m., June 20, through 6 a.m. June 23.
“I think people understand how we came to the decision,” Harsha said. “We’re very thankful for their support. When we do close it, we are disrupting commerce and the economy because there are so many commuters. We understand the impact it has in the area.”
Crews will work 24 hours a day to expedite milling, grading, placing crushed base and paving. They’ll also install guardrails and signs.
The highway will be closed between the Coal Creek Campground on the west side and the gate at mile marker 7 on the east side. People can still bike and otherwise recreate on the east side of Teton Pass and access the Coal Creek Campground on the west side. But WYDOT is warning walkers and bikers to beware of heavy trucks and not descend from the top of the pass down the west side toward the Big Fill work site.

The June 7, 2024 landslide made national news, spurring local businesses to reassure visitors they could still reach Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. But the closure also highlighted the vulnerabilities of a mountain community’s robust tourism and lifestyle economy.
That so much depends on a single road became evident just last week when a trailer lost its load on Highway 22, blocking both lanes of travel near the Snake River bridge. 
On June 5, Hammond started receiving texts from contractors working in Teton County on a second major WYDOT project, building a new four-lane bridge over the Snake River between Jackson and Wilson. The multi-year, $60 million bridge reconstruction and intersection redesign is expected to wrap up in July. 
A log cabin fell off a trailer, “at least twice,” including on the WYDOT jobsite. Crews moved some concrete barriers to give the abode a temporary home.
“We were able to get that cabin off the road to get the lanes open,” Hammond said. “Otherwise, it was blocking the entire road.”
The transport company had tried to move the Etna-bound cabin in the middle of the night but quickly ran into trouble, the Jackson Hole News and Guide reported Friday. The sudden sight of a cabin taking up residence on the bridge spawned some humor on social media, with commenters posting on Facebook, “rent is 3k as it sits”; “Hey you can’t park there” and “someone move in, squatters rights!”

But it also seriously snarled the morning commute, backing eastbound traffic all the way up Teton Pass and disrupting travel for workers, visitors and school kids, who had their tardies excused. Even after the road reopened, it took another four hours to clear the congestion, Hammond said. The cabin was finally removed Saturday morning, he said, “before everyone was up.”
Although unrelated to the Teton Pass project, the cabin debacle shows how long it can take to clear traffic once commuters from Idaho get stacked up, Hammond said. 
Highway 22 between Jackson and Teton Village Road sees about 18,000 vehicles per day on average — but 24,000 in July and August with a peak of 27,000, according to WYDOT data. The stretch over Teton Pass to the Idaho state line sees an average of 10,000 vehicles per day. In the height of summer, daily trips jump to around 16,000 west of Teton Village Road and 10,000 east of Victor, Idaho. For comparison, the divided four-lane stretch of Interstate 80 between Green River and Rock Springs accommodates an annual average of 25,000 vehicles per day.
Knowing how any disruption can create problems on the busy Teton corridor, WYDOT wanted to give at least two weeks advance notice of the upcoming weekend pass closure so workers could plan ahead.  
“We wanted to give them an opportunity to maybe set up an alternate schedule,” Hammond said. “We can’t really reach all the tourists, but we’ll be putting up variable messaging signs.”
After the road first failed, WYDOT contracted for $900,000 with Evans Construction to put in an emergency detour. That got the vital highway reopened within 20 days. Now Ames Construction is putting the finishing touches on the permanent fix to the tune of about $43 million. 
The detour functioned well but has an 11.3% grade and a 20-mph speed limit. The rebuild follows the original, more gentle contour that uses fill material to create a bridge between two hills, hence the name “Big Fill.” The speed limit will return to 45 mph with a speed advisory that likely will be set at 35 mph, Hammond said.
Although WYDOT had observed movement there for decades, Hammond said, “it wasn’t a big concern until it was. When it slid out.”
WYDOT hired a geotechnical engineer with experience working on landslides around the country and has taken steps to avert future problems. 
The three factors that contributed to the slide were lubrication, too much weight “or driving force” on top of the fill and too little “resisting force” holding the bottom together, Hammond said.
“When you get all three together, that’s typically when landslides happen,” he said. 


So crews have inserted drains at the base of the fill so groundwater doesn’t pool there like it did before. Workers have excavated and drilled “micro piles” — steel rods inside a casing — in a pattern to stitch  together the ground beneath the new fill to increase “resisting force.” To reduce “driving force,” the new fill includes lightweight material that cuts the total weight in half to around 60 pounds per cubic foot compared to the typical 120-125 pounds per cubic foot, Hammond said.
Hammond credits both Evans and Ames with getting the job done quickly in the face of catastrophe. 
“We got some contractors who understood what they had to do and how important it was,” he said. 
Once the pass reopens after the rebuilt curve is freshly paved, only some minor cleanup will remain. 
But unpredictable weather could foil the plan, so WYDOT is recommending the public sign up for text alerts to find out if there are last-minute changes.

Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.

“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.

Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.


Births are expensive

The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.











You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services.


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform



“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Birthing units in rural Alabama struggle with costs, driving risks for expectant mothers

Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.

Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.

State action

Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.

“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Legislature passed a bipartisan bill Monday that extends tax breaks for some of the country’s most profitable technology companies on their data centers up to the year 2077, in a win for both Big Tech and the trade unions that build the data warehouses.
The once boutique tax subsidy has exploded in cost in recent years, as tech companies chased the benefit to meet ever increasing demand for computing power. In fiscal year 2015, the state estimated a sales tax break for data center purchases of computers, servers and other equipment costs the state about $6 million. That number is projected to explode to $114 million in fiscal year 2025 — a 1,800% increase — according to state tax expenditure reports.
Minnesota currently has 42 data centers, with the majority spread across the metro. Nationwide, tech companies are rapidly building data centers — warehouses with computer servers used to power the internet and, increasingly, AI — to store and process data.
As Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats in the divided Legislature confronted a worsening fiscal outlook, however, they looked to the data center tax breaks. They settled on revoking the sales tax exemption on electricity bills, which are massive because of data center energy requirements.
Curbing this tax break alone will bring in an estimated $140 million over the next four years.
But lawmakers also gave Big Tech a win, extending the expiration of the state’s sales tax break for data centers on purchases of computers, servers, software and cooling and energy equipment.
Minnesota law currently allows data centers this sales tax exemption on technology equipment for 20 years, up to the year 2042. The bill passed Monday will extend the tax break to 35 years with a sunset date of 2042. This means that a data center that makes its first purchase in 2042 could continue claiming the exemption until 2077.
Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, has been negotiating for the data center sales tax break throughout the session. Rest, the Senate’s chief author of the data center bill, said the Legislature can use the tax breaks as leverage to ensure proper regulation of the nascent industry.
“This is the beginning of how we can bring a new industrial age that is one that we are going to control,” Rest said Monday.
The bill also includes a new annual fee on large-scale data centers between $2 million and $5 million to go to the Department of Commerce’s weatherization account, which grants energy upgrades to low-income Minnesotans. The bill also requires public utilities to offer a clean energy tariff for data center companies, i.e, the company can pay an additional fee to the utility for the utility to fund the development of clean energy technology that the data center could one day consume.
Rep. Athena Hollins, DFL-St. Paul, voted against the bill.
“I am anti-tax breaks for billionaires. When we are saying that we are trying to incentivize people to come to our state to build these facilities, we are saying that the tax burden is going to lie on our constituents,” Hollins said Monday.
The sales tax exemption on technology equipment — even with the elimination of the sales tax break on electricity — is expected to cost Minnesota $133 million in fiscal year 2027 and jump to $219 million in fiscal year 2029 as the number of data centers increases and they purchase more equipment, according to the Department of Revenue.
The data center tax breaks are a huge win for building trade unions, which warned lawmakers that Minnesota will lose jobs if it can’t compete with neighboring states to entice tech giants to build their data centers here.
Amazon recently announced it was suspending construction of a data center in Becker, citing regulatory uncertainty. Meanwhile, the company announced a $20 billion data center project in Pennsylvania, where Gov. Josh Shapiro — a potential Walz rival for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination — stood with construction workers to make the announcement.
The Minnesota data centers package included a provision requiring that companies must pay workers a prevailing wage to build the data centers, which ensures much of the construction will be done by unionized companies.
The House passed the bill 85-43 and the Senate 40-26.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY- A new law that gives women access to a six month prescription of birth control will make it easier to access pregnancy prevention medication, one health advocate said. 
Maintaining access to contraceptives can be difficult for women who live in rural areas, have multiple jobs, children to care for and limited transportation.
 Senate Bill 176 will require fewer trips to the pharmacy, said Laura Bellis executive director of the Take Control Initiative.
The new law, which takes effect Nov. 1, requires insurance companies that provide coverage for contraception to allow women to obtain six months of birth control at the same time after being prescribed a three month supply. 
The Take Control Initiative, which is based in Tulsa County, has operated the nation’s longest running birth control access program for 15 years. The program is focused on removing barriers while growing access to birth control. 
Increasing access can also improve the effectiveness of contraception. Bellis said some methods of contraception require individuals to take it at the same time every day. Maintaining access to care aids in consistency.
Having access to contraception by age 20, reduces women’s chances of living in poverty, according to the group’s 2024 annual report.
Sen. Jo Anna Dossett, D-Tulsa, one of the authors of the legislation declined to comment. Rep. Cynthia Roe, R-Lindsay, did not return messages seeking comment.
Although contraception can be used to prevent pregnancy, 14% of women use it for non-contraceptive reasons. It can be used to treat acne, irregular periods, cramps, migraines and endometriosis. 
“Hopefully this change in law will remove a barrier to these organizations that are truly trying to protect public health in Oklahoma,” said Mary Boren, D-Norman. She was one of 30 senators who voted in favor of it.
Gov. Kevin Stitt allowed the bill to become law without his signature.

Connect KS, a resource website that will answer questions of small business owners and help them find resources in their part of the state, is part of the SBO, said Taylor Overton, who heads up the new office.
The resources were announced at an event at the Tee Box in downtown Topeka that drew entrepreneurs from across the state to share the importance of finding programs and information to help them succeed. In addition, many spoke about being part of a Kansas delegation recently at the Global Entrepreneurship Congress in Indiana.
“One of the reasons why this is so important is that new businesses under five years old create the most net new jobs in our economy,” said Jason Grill, with Right to Start, a nonprofit organization that advocates for small businesses. “They also grow GDP, and they increase lifetime incomes. They increase community wealth, very much so, in lifetime incomes, they diversify our goods and services in our communities, and they fight inequality and poverty.”
Grill told about 50 people gathered that for every 1% increase in entrepreneurship in a community, there is a 2% decrease in poverty.
Joshua Jefferson, deputy secretary of business development at the commerce department, said the coordination of resources throughout the state is key to the new initiatives.
“We’re here to commit to the work of a new era in small business support here in Kansas,” he said. “The COVID 19 pandemic exposed that the Kansas Department of Commerce was not doing enough for small businesses in the state of Kansas. In the wake of a once-in-a-century economic crisis, we examined the way that the agency was working, and in the process, we discovered that we really weren’t supporting small business as much as we could, or that we should.”
Jefferson said the creation of the SBO, along with resources like Connect KS, was the culmination of those efforts to change the state’s support network. 
“We can do more, and we will do more,” he said.
He outlined resources included in the SBO and stressed that part of the task has been making them easier to navigate and accessible to all Kansans.
 “By creating a coordinated statewide hub for entrepreneurs at every stage, we’re coordinating key resources and creating centralized points of contact for entrepreneurs who are navigating the tough work of business development certifications, permitting access to capital, mentorships and much, much more,” he said.
Much of the work of the SBO is connecting people with opportunity, and Overton said she was excited to take a Kansas delegation to the global congress to network with people from around the world.

Wichita business owner Kristin Kienzle, who attended the Global Entrepreneurship Congress in Indiana, said she is learning about creating a successful franchising model that can be replicated nationwide as she explores opportunities to expand into Oklahoma. 
Kienzle, who owns Utopia Modern Salon Suites, grew her unique approach to offering salon services from one site to three in Wichita, with more on the way. 
“I learned some tactical things. I learned some inspirational things and then I also just kind of learned some things about myself,” she said.
Being with other entrepreneurs helped her realize how little people understand about what it takes to start a business and manage all the risks.
“As an entrepreneur, we just do what we do,” she said. “So being in the room on a grand stage with all these people who have done great things, everyone from Mark Cuban down to the guy who started this business six weeks ago, and everything in between was just so it just made me realize, wow, these people, and this is a really unique crowd.”
Trademark attorney Julie Grabbe, of Hays, said meeting people from other countries was valuable.
“I’m in west Kansas, so we’re in a different situation than a lot of the more metropolitan cities,” she said. “But commerce is very important to us. We want to be able to keep our young talent. We want to keep growing our cities. We want it to be a vibrant place to live. I think one of the ways to do that is really to have the support of the state to go out and do these kinds of things and get these ideas.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Taylor-Overton-1-20250610-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The U.S. Justice Department is defending itself against two New Hampshire transgender high school students who allege that President Donald Trump’s executive orders earlier this year would unconstitutionally deprive them of playing girls’ sports.
In a June 6 filing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard Lawson argued the two students, Parker Tirrell and Iris Turmelle, had not established an imminent risk of being affected by the executive orders. And he contended that even if the executive order did affect the students, the administration’s intent — to prevent transgender girls from playing girls’ sports — is lawful.
“… The Sports Order’s classification is rationally related to the physical advantages of males in sports and serves the legitimate government purpose of ensuring equal opportunities for females,” Lawson wrote.
The filing comes as Tirrell and Turmelle are suing the state of New Hampshire in federal court to overturn House Bill 1205, a 2024 New Hampshire law that limits middle school and high school girls’ sports teams to children who were female at birth. That law would prevent Tirrell and Turmelle, both transgender girls, from participating on their sports teams.
In September, Judge Landya McCafferty of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily stops HB 1205 from applying to Tirrell and Turmelle, allowing them to continue playing while the case proceeds. That order does not apply to other transgender students in the state.
But while the state law is temporarily frozen, lawyers for Tirrell and Turmelle argue Trump’s executive orders this year pose a new threat. Those orders, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and “Keeping Men out of Women’s Sports,” require the Department of Education to interpret Title IX, the law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in schools, to exclude transgender female athletes from female sports and warn school districts to align their policies to that interpretation or lose federal funding.
In February, attorneys for Turmelle and Tirrell filed a motion to expand their lawsuit against the state to also include the Trump administration, and specifically asked the New Hampshire District Court to strike down Trump’s executive orders.
The threat question
In its recent response, the Trump administration argues there is no evidence that the president’s executive orders have affected Tirrell or Turmelle yet, and that the lawsuit seeking to stop those orders should thus be dismissed. Without that direct harm, plaintiffs have failed to state a proper claim for a lawsuit, defendants wrote.
“Plaintiffs lack constitutional standing, and their stated speculative risk of future injury is not close to imminent and may never become ripe,” the Department of Justice wrote.
The plaintiffs had argued that the executive order “to target investigations and rescind federal funding” put the girls’ ability to continue playing on girls’ sports teams at risk. But the government argues that that alleged threat is not strong enough. And they say the plaintiffs have not met a critical two-part test: to show that the injury is both “imminent” — meaning it is “certainly impending” and not just speculative — and “particularized” — meaning it specifically affects the plaintiffs suing, and not just the general population.
In an interview Monday, Chris Erchull, staff attorney for GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), rejected the government’s contention that the executive orders do not pose a threat to the New Hampshire students.
He pointed to the Trump administration’s April lawsuit against the Maine Department of Education, in which the administration argued the state was violating Title IX by allowing transgender students to compete on girls’ sports teams. That example, Erchull said, indicates that the administration could easily turn its attention on New Hampshire school districts.
“If they’re not challenging the executive order in court, without court protection, the United States Department of Education can and almost certainly will go after the school districts where these two young people play sports and try to cut funding to those schools,” he said.
But the Department of Justice attorneys wrote that any future funding cuts to Turmelle or Tirrell’s public schools that might result from Trump’s executive order would involve a number of decisions in the future and are “far too speculative,” the government wrote. The process to cut off Title IX funds to a school district requires the Department of Education to file a notice to the school district, includes a potential hearing, and mandates a full written report to Congress, all of which can take months, the government wrote.
“Plaintiffs here do not (and cannot) plausibly allege that the Agency Defendants have even started this multi-step process for any educational program in New Hampshire, much less the two particular schools that Plaintiffs attend,” the government wrote. “They do not (and cannot) point to even an initiated investigation in New Hampshire.”
Attorneys with the Justice Department suggested that the U.S. Department of Education might not even bother with investigations into New Hampshire schools, since the state already passed a state law, HB 1205, barring transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Through the lens of Title IX
Even if Tirrell and Turmelle are blocked from participating in sports, the executive orders do not violate the Fifth Amendment or Title IX, the government motion argues.
According to the motion, Trump’s executive orders are designed to protect women’s sports, meaning that they uphold the purpose of Title IX. “Because of the inherent physiological difference between males and females, the Sports Order’s policy of ‘oppos[ing] male competitive participation in women’s sports’ is substantially related to the important government interest of safety, fairness, and ensuring ‘women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports,’” the motion states.
The government’s motion continues by asserting that neither transgender status nor gender identity are protected classes under Title IX. In 2020, the Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County that gender identity is a protected class under the anti-sex-based discrimination provision of Title VII, in a case relating to employment law. But the Department of Justice says that decision does not apply to Title IX, and that the goal of keeping girls’ sports exclusive to cisgender girls is allowed under federal law.
Erchull disagrees.
“When you make a transgender status-based classification, that’s a sex-based classification,” he said. “And we have tons of precedent that says that that is entitled to heightened scrutiny, but what the federal government is saying is that that doesn’t count.”
The plaintiffs in the case will likely file a response brief to the government’s motion in the coming weeks, and eventually the parties will appear in federal court for oral arguments, Erchull said.
And attorneys on both sides are watching the Supreme Court this month. Justices are expected to issue a decision in United States v. Skrmetti, a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Tennessee ban on transgender medical care. The decision could affect how both sides shape their arguments in New Hampshire, Erchull said.

Kelly Armstrong's veto. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s attorney general said Wednesday Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s veto was “sound,” dismissing a differing conclusion by legislative staff that his intent was unclear and the Legislature should hold a special session to fix the error.
The opinion by Attorney General Drew Wrigley means $35 million for housing programs Armstrong’s office unintentionally crossed out in a May line-item veto can move forward unless the matter is challenged in court or the Legislature reconvenes.
“There’s been a bit of a tempest created in all of it, but what the governor did was a very modest veto,” Wrigley said. 
Armstrong’s veto message for the Industrial Commission budget described cutting $150,000 set aside for a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. But a markup of the bill also crossed out a $35 million appropriation for affordable housing and homelessness — funding Armstrong had intended to leave intact. His office later said there had been a “staff markup error.” 
‘Prudent remedy’ for veto error is special session, Legislative Council advises

Since then, the Legislature has been trying to figure out what actions, if any, must be taken to address the veto — including the possibility of calling a special session.
Wrigley found that the unintentional markup does not change the substance of the veto because Armstrong’s written veto message was “clear and unambiguous” about what parts of Senate Bill 2014 he intended to cut.
He said in a Wednesday press conference that a “visual image” should not “take precedence over the written orders, the detailed description offered by the one person with the power to veto.”
Attorneys for North Dakota’s legislative branch in a Friday memo took a very different position, advising the Legislature that calling a special session would be the “prudent remedy” for the mistake. 
In its memo, Legislative Council said legal precedent suggests the marked-up bill is part of the official veto document. 
“It would not be appropriate to allow the Governor and Attorney General to resolve the ambiguity by agreement,” the memo states. Doing so could have unintended consequences for how ambiguous vetoes are handled in the future, Legislative Council said.
Wrigley called the Legislative Council memo a “political document” and said the Attorney General’s Office has the final say on the matter unless the issue is challenged in court. 
“The power in question is strictly the governor’s power and it has to be in compliance with the constitution and laws of North Dakota,” he told the North Dakota Monitor last week. “That’s the only assessment here. There’s no role for this in Legislative Council. They have no authority in this regard.”
Armstrong, whose office requested the opinion, in a statement agreed with Wrigley’s findings.
“We appreciate the Attorney General’s determination, which clarifies the matter, avoids the cost of a special session and nullifies the flawed interpretation that initially blew this up into something much bigger than it needed to be,” he said.
A special session is estimated to cost $65,000 per day, Legislative Council has said.
The Legislature could still decide to reconvene for a special session to override the veto if it chooses to, Wrigley said.
Senate Majority Leader David Hogue, R-Minot, said he disagrees with the attorney general’s conclusions.
He said legislative leadership and Legislative Council will meet with the governor’s office to discuss next steps.
“I don’t want there to be uncertainty about these issues,” he said.
The interim Legislative Management Committee would have to vote on whether to challenge the opinion in court.
Legislative Council Director John Bjornson said the office did not immediately have a statement on the opinion.
The bill takes effect July 1.

HOLLAND — Big plans for the Kraft Heinz Co. plant in Holland just hit a major snag.
A $170 million federal grant that was supposed to help the factory slash its carbon emissions by more than 99% has been canceled by the Trump Administration, according to a recent news release.
The grant was part of a larger $3.7 billion in clean energy funding that the administration decided to nix.
The Department of Energy award was initially meant to help the Holland plant, along with nine other Kraft Heinz facilities across the U.S., become much greener.
It aimed to drastically cut carbon pollution, save billions of gallons of water, and significantly reduce energy use over the next decade.
For Holland, this meant bringing in advanced technologies such as heat pumps and electric equipment to power the plant with cleaner energy.
In a statement released by Kraft Heinz, officials said the setback won’t stop them from investing in efficient projects.
“We are aware of the unilateral decision made by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. While we will continue to evaluate this decision, it does not change our intention to continue investing in our 30 U.S. manufacturing facilities,” the statement indicated. “Over the next approximately five years, we plan to invest $3 billion to modernize our U.S. supply chain infrastructure. We will continue to drive energy efficiency projects forward as we make these investments.”
However, the U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the cancellation of 24 clean energy projects, including the Kraft Heinz grant, earlier this month.
The administration claims these projects, many started under the previous Biden Administration, didn’t have a thorough financial review, weren’t truly viable, or wouldn’t provide a good return on taxpayer money.
This move fits with the Trump Administration’s shift in energy priorities. Their proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2026 seeks to dramatically cut funding for most clean energy programs within the Department of Energy.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kraft_Heinz_World_Headquarters_Chicago_IL-JPG2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(AP) — James McDonough served in the U.S. Army for 27 years, fighting in Vietnam and delivering humanitarian aid to Rwanda. For him, Saturday’s military parade in Washington for the Army’s 250th anniversary — coinciding with President Donald Trump’s birthday — is about the resilience of a vital institution and the nation it serves.
“The soldiers marching that day represent all of that history,” said McDonough, 78, of Crofton, Maryland. “They don’t represent a single day. They don’t represent a single person. It’s the American Army still standing straight, walking tall, ready to defend our country.”

Christopher Purdy, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, called the parade a facade that paints over some of the Republican president’s policies that have targeted military veterans and current service members, including cuts at the Department of Veterans Affairs and a ban on transgender troops.
Purdy said the parade, long sought by Trump, will needlessly display U.S. military might on the president’s 79th birthday.
“It’s embarrassing,” said Purdy, 40, of Atlanta. “It’s expensive. And whatever his reasons are for doing it, I think it’s entirely unnecessary.”
Until recently, the Army’s long-planned birthday celebration did not include a big parade. Added under the Trump administration, the event, featuring hundreds of military vehicles and aircraft and thousands of soldiers, has divided veterans.
Some liken it to the military chest-pounding commonly seen in North Korea, a step toward authoritarianism or a perverse birthday party for Trump.
Others see it as a once-in-a-lifetime accounting of the Army’s achievements and the military service of millions of soldiers over centuries. The parade is not about Trump, they say, but the public seeing the faces of soldiers when so few Americans serve.
The Army expects up to 200,000 people could attend and says the parade will cost an estimated $25 million to $45 million.
Trump, speaking at Fort Bragg this week, said Saturday would be “a big day” and noted “we want to show off a little bit.”
“We’re going to celebrate our greatness and our achievements,” he said. “This week, we honor 250 years of valor and glory and triumph by the greatest fighting force ever to walk the face of the Earth: the United States Army.”
‘Divisive politics have ruined it’
For Edmundo Eugenio Martinez Jr., an Army veteran who fought in Iraq, the parade is a missed opportunity to honor generations of veterans, many of whom paid a steep price and came home to little fanfare.
“Sadly, the timing and the optics and divisive politics have ruined it,” said Martinez, 48, of Katy, Texas. “And I’m not picking one side or the other. Both sides are guilty.”

‘It’s just suspicious’
Joe Plenzler, a retired Marine who fought in Iraq, said Trump wants to see troops saluting him on his birthday as tanks roll past.
“It’s just suspicious,” the 53-year-old from Middletown, Virginia, said of the timing.
“I absolutely love the Army from the bottom of my cold black Marine heart,” he said. “But if the Army’s birthday was a day later, we probably wouldn’t be doing it. I’d rather see that $50 million take care of the men and women who went off to war and came back with missing arms, legs and eyeballs, and with damaged brains.”
‘Part of American culture’
Joe Kmiech, who served in the Army and Minnesota National Guard from 1989 to 1998, supports the parade because the Army is “part of American culture and our fabric.”
He notes the Army’s pioneering contributions to engineering and medicine, from dams to new surgical techniques. Like many veterans, he has a strong familial connection: His father served in the Army, and so did his maternal grandfather, who fought in World War II.
“I didn’t vote for President Trump, but the commander in chief is going to be part of that celebration,” said Kmiech, 54, of Roberts, Wisconsin. “The distinction needs to be made that the parade is a celebration of our Army, not of a person.”
‘Stroking Trump’s ego’
For Gulf War Army veteran Paul Sullivan, Trump and the parade are inextricably linked.
“This Trump tank travesty is all about stroking Trump’s ego,” said Sullivan, 62, who lives outside Charlottesville, Virginia. “If Trump truly cared about our service members, he would sit down with them quietly and say, ‘What can we do with $50 million or $100 million to make your lives better?’ He’s not.”

‘We are a great nation’
McDonough, the veteran from Crofton, Maryland, disagrees that the parade is about Trump or too costly. He said the U.S. held a grand celebration in New York after World War II when the nation was deeply in debt.
“We certainly need to bring our debt down, and we certainly need to take care of our veterans,” he said. “But it’s a false dichotomy. It’s like saying if we bought two less aircraft carriers, we could do so much better to take care of our poor.”
And McDonough said soldiers’ oath is to the Constitution, not to Trump.
The president “understands the importance of doing this, not only for the Army, but for the nation,” McDonough said.
‘A real dark turn’
Purdy, the veteran from Atlanta, said the parade’s brazen flex of military strength is not an American tradition, particularly absent a recent victory.
“I’m not saying we shouldn’t celebrate the country,” he said. “But for us to be projecting this type of hard power, in such a real in-your-face way, that’s just not who we are.”
Trump is brushing aside old alliances and foreign aid that have helped maintain peace for decades, Purdy asserted.
“It signals a real dark turn if we’re just going to roll out the tanks,” Purdy said.
‘People are the Army’
Michael Nardotti, an Army veteran who served in Vietnam, said military hardware has long been in American parades, which can help recruitment.

More important, he said, is the tremendous value in the public seeing soldiers’ faces in a parade when active-duty troops make up less than 1% of the population.
“‘People are the Army,’” said Nardotti, 78, of Aldie, Virginia, quoting a former Army chief of staff.
Nardotti said he’ll listen carefully to Trump’s speech.

Tulsa residents tapped Democrat Amanda Clinton for House District 71.
Clinton received 85% of the vote while Republican Beverly A. Atteberry received 15%.
The seat became open when Rep. Amanda Swope, D-Tulsa, stepped down in December to take a position in the City of Tulsa’s government.
In House District 97, Democrat Aletia Timmons garnered 59% of the vote while fellow Democrat JeKia Harrison earned 41%.
The seat, covering parts of northeast Oklahoma City and Jones, became vacant when Rep. Jason Lowe, D-Oklahoma City, stepped down to serve on the Oklahoma County Commission.
No other candidates filed for the post.
In the race for House District 74 in northern Tulsa County and western Rogers County, Republican Kevin Wayne Nowood garnered 65% of the vote to Democrat Amy Hossain’s 35%.
The seat became open when Rep. Mark Vancuren, R-Owasso, resigned to take a post in Tulsa County government.

Jeff Landry addresses the Louisiana Legislature on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)As Gov. Jeff Landry’s assault on state ethics laws continues to unfold, there remains a small glimmer of hope for those who wish to see Louisiana politics to depart from its history of corruption and cronyism.
It comes from the demise of ​​House Bill 160, by Rep. Kellee Hennessy Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, which would have removed confidentiality protections from anyone filing an ethics complaint. A tipster’s identity would have been revealed to the elected official, lobbyist, public employee or government contractor they accused of wrongdoing, even if the complaint or tip didn’t result in an investigation. 
Dickerson placed multiple hindrances in her bill to deter individuals from coming forward with damning information. To submit a tip, complainants would have been required to submit a notarized, signed document by mail or to deliver it in person to the state ethics administration’s offices in downtown Baton Rouge, where they would be required to present identification. The representative insisted tipsters need not feel intimidated because, under her bill, they could sue for damages if they were harassed as a result of submitting a tip or complaint.
As with the governor’s ethics law upheaval, Dickerson’s legislation places the interests of the politically powerful ahead of the individual citizen seeking to do right. The provisions in her bill would have created needless costs, inconvenience and unwarranted public scrutiny for whistleblowers. 
Dickerson also wanted to limit what materials ethics investigators could use to begin a probe to materials submitted by government agencies and officials. News reports, which triggered 18 ethics investigations from 2020-23, would have been declared off-limits – an especially disappointing restriction given Dickerson’s background as a journalist.  
Her motivation for bringing the bill was clear. As a member of the Livingston Parish School Board, she ran afoul of ethics rules in 2023 when she helped a high school teacher obtain a contract to perform construction work on the same campus – a double-dip that’s not allowed under state law. 
Dickerson, who was running for state representative at the time, was fined $1,500. She said a political opponent brought the incident to the attention of the state ethics board, and she has described the process as “abusive” and “very chilling.”
The same words could easily apply to her legislation, which fizzled in the Louisiana Senate after ethics board members wrote to senators asking that they shelve the measure. Dickerson credited their letter with killing her bill, calling their action “harassing.”
“I guess people fear the retaliation of the ethics board being against it,” Dickerson told the Illuminator.
No, representative. The only thing public officials should fear are the consequences from breaking ethics laws. But as the governor continues to chip away at what are largely toothless regulations to begin with, there’s not so much to be frightened of these days.

The “day of defiance” is called “No Kings” and has more than a dozen events scheduled around the Hoosier state.
“On June 14 — Flag Day — Donald Trump wants tanks in the street and a made-for-TV display of dominance for his birthday. A spectacle meant to look like strength. But real power isn’t staged in Washington. It rises up everywhere else,” the No Kings website says. “Instead of allowing this birthday parade to be the center of gravity, we will make action everywhere else the story of America that day: people coming together in communities across the country to reject strongman politics and corruption.”
An Indianapolis protest runs from noon to 3 p.m. at the Statehouse. Other events include:

Fort Wayne: 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the Allen County Courthouse
Bloomington: Noon to 3 p.m. at the Monroe County Courthouse
Muncie: 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. at the Fallen Heroes Memorial Bridge
Terre Haute: 10 a.m. to noon at the Vigo County Courthouse
Corydon: Noon to 2 p.m. in downtown Corydon

The D.C. parade is part of the U.S. Army’s 250th anniversary celebration, but it also coincides with Trump’s 79th birthday.
The event, according to Army officials, is expected to include about 6,600 soldiers, as well as about 150 vehicles and over 50 aircraft in the celebration. Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend.
The costs of the event have ballooned to between $25 million and $45 million, an Army spokesperson told CNBC. Street repairs alone could cost upwards of $16 million, according to NBC.
Some states are sending contingents of National Guard members. The Indiana National Guard said just six soldiers will attend, and on a voluntary basis.
The No Kings group is not having a counter protest in D.C.
“From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we’re taking action to reject authoritarianism — and show the world what democracy really looks like,” the website said. “On June 14th, we’re showing up everywhere he isn’t — to say no thrones, no crowns, no kings.”
The group said it expects participants to act lawfully and seek deescalation in potential confrontations with others. Weapons of any kind, even legal ones, shouldn’t be brought to No Kings events, it added.

(Dave Bordewyk/South Dakota Newspaper Association)The longest-serving current justice of South Dakota’s Supreme Court will step down in December, creating a vacancy to be filled by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden.
Justice Janine Kern represents the high court’s first district, which includes Custer, Lawrence, Meade and Pennington counties. Prior to her appointment by former Gov. Dennis Daugaard in 2014, Kern spent 18 years as a circuit court judge for that West River area.
Her father Paul Kern, a former circuit court judge, administered three oaths of office for her – first as an attorney, then a circuit court judge, and finally as a Supreme Court justice.
SD Supreme Court selects Jensen for second term as chief justice

“It is with a heart brimming with gratitude for the trust and confidence placed in me, which gave me the opportunity to serve the people of this great state, that I notify you of my retirement on December 8, 2025, nearly 29 years to the day of my investiture as a circuit court judge,” the 64-year-old Kern said in her retirement announcement. “It has been a deep honor and privilege to serve.”
In a press release on her announcement, Chief Justice Steven Jensen praised Kern for her “unwavering commitment to justice, the integrity of the courts, and a deep compassion for the people we serve.”
In addition to her service as a judicial officer, Kern served on the Council of Juvenile Services from 2004 to 2013 and on the Federal Advisory Committee on Juvenile Justice from 2004 and 2008, as well as on numerous other boards and commissions.
“I work with several young attorneys who look up to her as a role model, so her steady hand on the court will be missed,” Rhoden said in a press release. “As I review potential appointments to replace her on the bench, I will be hopeful that we can find a future Supreme Court judge of her caliber.” 
Kern is one of two women  — the other being Justice Patricia DeVaney — currently serving on the five-member high court. Kern was previously part of the state’s only female-majority state Supreme Court, serving alongside Justices Lori Wilbur and Judith Meierhenry, who was the first woman appointed to the state’s high court.
That female majority court heard a single case on a single day, April 25, 2017, when then-Justice Steven Zinter disqualified himself and retired Justice Meierhenry stepped in. Wilbur retired later that year.
Kern is one of three current justices appointed by Daugaard, the others being Mark Salter and Jensen, who was elected chief justice by his colleagues in 2021. Former Gov. Kristi Noem appointed Justices DeVaney and Scott Myren.
Rhoden will choose Kern’s replacement based on recommendations from the state Judicial Qualifications Commission.
To be considered, potential justices must be licensed to practice law in South Dakota and voting residents of the district from which they are appointed at the time they take office.
Justices face retention elections on the November general election ballot three years after their initial appointment, and every eight years after that.

THIS STORY HAS BEEN UPDATED 









The Amber Alert issued Tuesday evening for 3-year-old Nola Dinkins has been canceled, and the case is now being investigated as a homicide, according to New Castle County Police.
The alert was issued after Nola’s mother reported that an unknown white male armed with a handgun had abducted the child from her vehicle on the 500 block of Gender Road in Newark. She told police she had pulled over to comfort her daughter when the man approached, took Nola, and fled in a dark-colored SUV driven by a white female.
Following an overnight investigation involving the New Castle County Police Criminal Investigations Unit and the FBI, detectives determined the mother’s initial account was false.
“There is no danger to the public,” police said in a statement. “Sadly, this incident is now being treated as a homicide investigation by the Maryland State Police.”
Authorities have not yet released additional details regarding Nola’s whereabouts or any arrests made. New Castle County Police said they are continuing to work closely with the FBI and Maryland State Police, who are now leading the investigation.

As the world adjusts to the results of the 2024 presidential election, one YouTube channel has attempted to foster open, authentic debates in our increasingly politically polarized world. 
In these videos, a political pundit is seated in the center of a gray room, surrounded by people with opposing viewpoints. In the series from channel Jubilee, aptly named Surrounded, the pundit’s shocking stance will be read aloud (think: ‘Kamala Harris is a DEI candidate’). A small analog clock runs down from 20 minutes. Like a speed chess match in your local park, competitors flock to the single chair to take on the smug expert. And just like one of those matches, the competitor walks back to their chair, feeling confused and slightly defeated. 

Bryce Leiberman
Of course, the noble goal of the Jubilee channel is to create an honest dialogue centered around the real issues affecting Americans. Yet this is rarely, if ever, what happens in practice. The three most recent videos utilizing this format have received over 40 million views. Yet, you would probably be hard-pressed to find an actual discussion within the hours of content in these long-form productions.
Too often, the debates become arguments centered around talking points or one-liners that distract from the actual substance of policy and concrete plans. Whether it is a Kamala Harris supporter mischaracterizing a Cesarean section as an abortion or a Trump supporter perpetuating the outrageous Barack Obama birther lies, these conversations are rife with misinformation and a severe lack of education on the real issues that are impacting American lives. 
Although the pundits do their best to remain civil, Jubilee videos often contain interruption and misplaced anger. The real problems of immigration, abortion, and the environment are lost in a sea of political jargon, a microcosm of our current political environment. 
This leads to the simple but frightening question: when did honest discourse in this country die? The ever-shortening attention spans of Americans make the allure of soundbites an attractive offer to any political enthusiast looking to catch their friends with a quick punchline or rehearsed quip. Yet, when asked to expound on the policy specifics, many people are at a loss for words. 
In a way, this is one of the most frightening aspects of the social media age: the obsessive need for 15-second explanations of complex political issues eliminates all possibility of nuance or critical thinking. This issue is precisely where Jubilee and the Surrounded series fall short. By promoting rushed conversations and viral ‘gotcha’ moments, the channel only exacerbates the problem of shortening attention spans and damages any prospect of policy-oriented debate.
As a soon-to-be voter, I am increasingly worried about the future of honest discourse. The lack of substance in many Jubilee videos in favor of punchlines and verbal jabs is everything wrong with our current political climate that is characterized by partisanship and rhetoric over any meaningful discussion. And as the steady drone of campaign ads and stump speeches has subsided in the months following the election, I can’t help but wonder if honest discourse in this country will continue its slow death along with it.

Since 1956, the Delaware Blue-Gold All*Star Football Game has stood apart from other high school All*Star games—not because of the athletes on the field, but because of the heart behind the event. More than a football tradition, Blue-Gold is a celebration of the human spirit, rooted in the belief that every person should be seen not for their disABILITY, but for their capABILITIES.
What makes this game unique is its deep personal connection to children and young adults with intellectual disABILITIES. In the months leading up to the game, players, cheerleaders, band members and student ambassadors are paired with a “Buddy”—an individual between the ages of 4 and 18 with an intellectual disABILITY. These bonds become the true highlight of the season.
Many young Participants come into the experience thinking they will teach or inspire their Buddies, only to discover the opposite. They walk away transformed by the joy, love, and wisdom of the individuals they were meant to mentor. The game becomes a lesson in empathy, respect, and inclusion—lessons that last a lifetime.
For almost 70 years, this experience has left an indelible mark on Delaware. Since 1956, $6.4 million has been distributed to local organizations to help support programs that enrich the lives of Delawareans living with intellectual disABILITIES.
In Delaware, inclusion isn’t an afterthought—it’s a value, fostered by generations who’ve come through the Blue-Gold program. This year, the organization is calling on every individual, group, and business who believes in celebrating people’s ABILITIES to join them at what they call the “most important football game of the year.”
Come honor the athletes—and the message: Delaware is a place that sees the strength in every person, and chooses to lead with love, acceptance, and inclusion — celebrating all ABILITIES.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner. )Wisconsin Republicans considering running for governor in 2026 are criticizing Gov. Tony Evers for supporting California Gov. Gavin Newsom as he pushes back against President Donald Trump for sending armed troops into the state to respond to protests. 
As of Tuesday, President Donald Trump has authorized deployment of 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles as protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids continue in the southern California city. This is the first time in six decades that a president has called National Guard troops to respond to civil unrest without a governor’s request for help. The last time, in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson sent troops to Alabama to protect civil rights protesters.
Democratic governors, including Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, asserted their support for California Gov. Gavin Newsom in a joint statement Monday, saying that Trump’s actions were an “alarming abuse of power.”
“Governors are the Commanders in Chief of their National Guard and the federal government activating them in their own borders without consulting or working with a state’s governor is ineffective and dangerous,” the governors said. “Further, threatening to send the U.S. Marines into American neighborhoods undermines the mission of our service members, erodes public trust and shows the Trump administration does not trust local law enforcement. It’s important we respect the executive authority of our country’s governors to manage their National Guards — and we stand with Gov. Newsom who has made it clear that violence is unacceptable and that local authorities should be able to do their jobs without the chaos of this federal interference and intimidation.”
The Los Angeles police have said they could handle the protests, which had been mostly peaceful, though some violence had occurred.
Newsom has said he is suing Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Department of Defense for taking over the California’s National Guard unit, saying it has “needlessly escalated chaos and violence in the Los Angeles region.” 
White House border czar Tom Homan has suggested that he would arrest Newsom, but he hadn’t “crossed the line” yet. Trump, asked about the idea of arresting Newsom, said that he would “do it.” After Trump appeared open to the idea, Homan said there is “no intention to arrest the governor right now.”  
Wisconsin Republicans are standing behind Trump’s actions in LA and connecting Newsom to Evers’ actions regarding ICE. 
In reaction to the governors’ statement, Wisconsin businessman and Navy veteran Bill Berrien, who is considering running for governor in 2026, issued a press release through his Never Out of the Fight PAC saying that Newsom and Evers are enabling the “invasion of illegal immigrants” and “violent protests.” Berrien formed the PAC in April to advance conservative causes and to help Republicans win federal, state and local elections.
“We should be condemning this violence but our governor is once again putting violent criminals above law-abiding citizens,” Berrien said. “I served as a Navy SEAL to protect our country. President Trump is right to step up and end this chaos.”
Josh Schoemann, the first GOP candidate to officially launch a 2026 campaign, responded to a social media post that said the Democratic governors were endorsing “lawlessness and chaos on American streets,” noting a memo on ICE that Evers sent to state employees with guidance on handling ICE, and declaring “Tony’s Gotta Go!!”

Republicans have been critical of Evers for his handling of increased ICE activity in Wisconsin, including calling for him to be arrested when he stood by guidance that he gave to state employees to call a lawyer if ICE showed up at their office. Those calls came after Homan previously made comments that were interpreted as a threat to arrest Evers. 
Evers released a three-minute video following Homan’s vague threat, saying that it represents a “concerning trajectory in this country.” 
“We now have a federal government that will threaten or arrest an elected official — or even everyday American citizens — who have broken no laws, committed no crimes, and done nothing wrong,” Evers said in early May. “As disgusted as I am about the continued actions of the Trump Administration, I am not afraid. I have never once been discouraged from doing the right thing, and I will not start today.”

He was on his way home to Danbury when he got a message about a raid in Connecticut, in which apparent federal immigration agents detained four men in Southington.
Fonseca Tapia is part of a statewide group chat where community members share information about ICE sightings throughout Connecticut.
“It was a Facebook post, and they were asking if somebody could confirm, saying that four men had been taken from a car wash in Southington,” Fonseca Tapia said. “It didn’t say what car wash, only the street.”
Fonseca Tapia made a detour to Southington to find the business.
“I stopped by four car washes,” until he found the right one, he said.
When he found the car wash, Fonseca Tapia said he spoke to the owner to learn what happened.
Apparent plain clothes law enforcement captured on video 
At around 9 a.m. Monday, the owner said he received a call from one of his employees informing him that four police officers were looking for him.
Speaking in Spanish with Connecticut Public, the owner of the car wash has requested to not share his name or the name of his business. He said he does not want to jeopardize the safety of his other immigrant employees, who are fearful to return to work or to provoke any potential retaliation from federal immigration agents.
He thought it was Southington police because many of them go to get their cars washed at his business, but when his employee said it wasn’t town police, he said he immediately thought it must be ICE.
Provided security camera footage
“When I arrived, the man was very polite,” the owner said in Spanish. “He presented a set of documents and said that they were there to check the status of me and all my workers.”
The owner said he didn’t feel like he could resist because the men were armed.
Security footage reviewed by Connecticut Public appears to show at least two individuals, one in all black and another in jeans and a t-shirt, each with firearms on their hip. In the security footage, one of the individuals in jeans and a t-shirt apprehended one of the employees, taking him to a black vehicle to handcuff him before putting him inside the car.
“They asked for the papers of four of my employees,” the owner said. After making some calls and checking what looked to be a tablet, the owner said, “[the officer] said, ‘Okay all four are coming with us,’… They didn’t ask for the papers of any of my other employees. There were still around six employees [that they hadn’t talked to].”
According to the owner, the four men had been working for him for eight years. He said he’s worried for the families of those four men, who have wives with children and mothers that they take care of. He said he’s also worried for his business.
“The other [employees] are now afraid to come back to work with me,” he said, “but they need to work, and they have to work, I tell them. We have to keep going because life goes on. We need to pay rent. We need to eat. Our families need support.”
The owner said he never thought something like this would ever happen to him. He said he’d heard of how bad these kinds of incidents were getting in New York and Boston, but with how quiet and calm Connecticut is, he never imagined this could happen at his own business.
Southington police said they were unaware of the detainments at the time that they happened and that ICE did not notify them that they would be there. Federal immigration officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Southington Town Councilmember Jack Perry heard of the incident from a constituent who reached out during a council meeting Monday night. Perry said Town Manager Alex Ricciardone was also unaware of what had happened.
“For them to come to place a business and take the workers from doing their jobs—they weren’t committing any crimes—is just very alarming,” Perry said.
Now is the time to get vocal, Perry said.
“We have to talk about this and tell ICE that we don’t want them in our communities,” Perry said. “They need to get the hell out.”
An ‘emergency rally’ against immigration raids

After speaking with the owner on Monday, activist Juan Fonseca Tapia mobilized, working with fellow advocates, to call for an emergency rally. Within a couple hours, and after a day of anti-raid protests in the city, nearly 100 people gathered in front of the immigration court house in Hartford.
Even when it started to rain, more people were pouring in to demand the release of the four men and to show their support.
With a hoarse voice, after screaming and chanting at the state capitol, Fonseca Tapia spoke through a mega phone.
“Let me tell you what. I’m really f—king angry. I have a lot of rage because this morning we got together,” Fonseca Tapia said. “As we were standing at the capitol, four men were taken from their workplace.”
Fonseca Tapia said it was “infuriating and painful” to learn that the incident happened during those protests. His mind went straight to the families of those men.
“What it means for a child who might be waiting for their dad to play or have dinner, and now they don’t know where he is,” Fonseca Tapia said. “We have been trying to get people in power to see our humanity, and it’s sad. It’s really, really sad and painful to see that they still don’t see that we’re talking about people’s lives.”
What’s happening in the nation is now happening in Connecticut, Fonseca Tapia told protesters. He encouraged attendees to connect with one another, because he said the community needs to stay together and to show up for immigrant neighbors.
The response to the emergency rally Monday evening renewed his own hope in a better future for immigrant families in the country.
“By having close to 100 people show up in two hours,” Fonseca Tapia said, “and that there are still many of us that are holding on to our humanity, and that are choosing to show up for one another, that’s what’s driving me and I do believe that another world is possible.”

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The Detroit Regional Chamber’s annual Mackinac Policy Conference is a controversial fixture of Michigan politics. 
Each year politicians, lobbyists, business representatives and community leaders gather at the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island for three days of handshaking, networking and panel discussions aimed at issues like education, housing, economic development and foreign policy.
Recent conferences have featured appearances from members of the state’s congressional delegation and remarks from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, alongside various politicians, politicos and business leaders such as former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) and businessman Mark Cuban.
However, the conference has drawn criticism from Detroiters who say the chamber’s agenda doesn’t match their needs, while activist groups have raised concerns about the influence of corporate money in politics.
While media and certain government officials receive complimentary registration, attending the conference carries a multi-thousand dollar price tag, with registration for the 2025 conference coming in at $3,700 for general members of the Detroit Regional Chamber and $4,900 for future members.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)
The conference also carries several big name sponsors including Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, Rocket Companies and the state’s largest energy providers, DTE Energy and Consumers Energy. 
Sam Inglot, director of the progressive advocacy group Progress Michigan called the conference “a petri dish of some of the worst aspects of our political system.” 
“Corporate money flooding our politics, exclusive access for only those with money and a lot of self-congratulatory bullcrap from political and lobbying insiders. What do Michiganders actually get out of this performance?” Inglot said in a statement.
As part of its monthly Lake Effect Poll, conducted by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling, Progress Michigan asked 622 Michigan voters between May 30 and May 31, 2025 about their thoughts on the conference. 
One question states “these lawmaker trips to Mackinac Island are often funded by corporate lobbyists, who join lawmakers on the island as they make public policy decisions,” before asking voters whether they supported lawmakers traveling to places like Mackinac Island to make policy decisions that impact communities across the state.

In response, most voters opposed having their officials travel to the conference, with 44% in strong opposition and 27% saying they somewhat opposed the notion. 
While Republicans and Democrats offered similar levels of opposition to lawmakers making the trip to Mackinac to talk policy, independents offered the strongest opposition of any subpopulation, with 47% in strong opposition and 27% saying they were somewhat opposed. 
Another question states “Every year Michigan lawmakers travel to Mackinac Island, a place accessible only by ferry or private plane, to gather and make important public policy decisions,” before asking voters whether they support officials traveling to the island to make policy decisions. 
Responses to this question were increasingly split, with 45% of voters offering their opposition – with 25% strongly opposed – compared to 38% in support. The remaining 17% responded they weren’t sure of their opinion.
While Democrats were more supportive of lawmakers traveling to the island to make policy decisions with 46% offering support, Republicans and independents were more opposed to officials going on policymaking trips. Fifty-one percent of Republicans offered some form of opposition, while 50% of Independent voters were opposed, compared to the 35% of independents in support. 
“The more people learn about the Mackinac Policy Conference and the corporate lobbyists who are the engine of it, the less they support it,” Inglot said. “This is a trend we are seeing across the state, people are fed up with the corporate dominance of our politics. They want to see the money and the corrupting influence it brings out of our political system.”
Catia Sabak, the chamber’s director of communications said the Detroit Regional Chamber is proud to have led the conference for almost 50 years.  
“Other states have tried, and failed, to recreate this special convening of the state’s top leadership. It is truly unique in the nation,” Sabak said. “Despite that the Conference is hosted by a private business organization and hosted on private property, the Chamber’s current leadership has made most of the thought leadership shared on the Island available free of charge via a partnership with Detroit PBS and includes over 130 working media from local, state and national outlets, including CNN.”
In an emailed statement, Kim Murphy-Kovalick, the senior director of policy for Voters Not Politicians, said Progress Michigan’s polling underscores a key point: voters are fed up with the corrupting influence of money in politics.
While the conference is great for getting access to lawmakers and political leaders, the people who can afford to make that trip are mostly lobbyists, special interests groups and industry insiders, not voters, Murphy-Kovalick said. 
Michigan politicians should instead place their focus on representing the voters who are excluded from attending the conference, Murphy-Kovalick said. 
“Most everyday people have no insight into how Lansing functions, and this conference is one reason for that. If politicians can’t afford to attend on their own dime, how can everyday Michiganders hope to compete with wealthy special interests and corporations for their attention?” she said.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, along with Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., signed three “Make America Healthy Again” waivers on Tuesday, allowing three more states to enact restrictions to SNAP benefits. 
The move adds Utah, Idaho and Arkansas to the list of six states that have banned certain foods from being purchased with benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the U.S.’s largest nutrition assistance program. 
Arkansas approved to ban SNAP recipients from using benefits for soda, candy

Utah’s waiver prohibits using SNAP benefits to purchase “soft drinks,” defined as “a nonalcoholic beverage that is made with carbonated water and that is flavored and sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners,” according to HB403, the bill the Utah Legislature passed directing the state’s Department of Workforce Services to request the waiver. An earlier version of the bill would have also blocked candy purchases, but Utah lawmakers narrowed its scope before approving the bill. 
Utah’s SNAP restrictions, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2026, don’t go as far as other states. 
Arkansas’ waiver restricts SNAP participants from purchasing low- and no-calorie soda, fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice, and other “unhealthy drinks,” along with “confectionary products with flour and artificially sweetened candy, the Arkansas Advocate reported. Arkansas’ waiver will take effect July 1, 2026. 
Idaho’s waiver excludes soda and candy and will take effect the same day as Arkansas, on July 1.
Rollins previously signed SNAP waivers for Nebraska, Iowa, and Indiana.
The latest round of SNAP restriction approvals come amid a national movement coined “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, that’s been  promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 
In April, Kennedy stopped in Utah as part of his “MAHA tour.” During his visit he praised Utah’s SNAP ban, along with a slate of other “MAHA bills,” which was headlined by Utah’s first-in-the-nation law to ban cities from adding fluoride to drinking water. 
Idaho Legislature approves ban on SNAP coverage for candy, soda

“Thank you to the governors of Indiana, Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Iowa, and Nebraska for their bold leadership and unwavering commitment to Make America Healthy Again,” Kennedy said in a news release issued Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “I call on every governor in the nation to submit a SNAP waiver to eliminate sugary drinks — taxpayer dollars should never bankroll products that fuel the chronic disease epidemic.”
Rollins, in a prepared statement, said the Trump administration is “unified in improving the health of our nation.”
“America’s governors have proudly answered the call to innovate by improving nutrition programs, ensuring better choices while respecting the generosity of the American taxpayer,” Rollins said. “Each waiver submitted by the states and signed is yet another step closer to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again.” 
Critics of the SNAP restrictions, including Democrats and low-income advocates, argued states shouldn’t restrict freedom of choice and should treat Americans like adults who can practice personal responsibility. 
A ‘MAHA’ bill is making its way through the Utah Legislature

Food industry representatives have also expressed concerns about unintended consequences by limiting consumer choices and creating confusion about what can or can’t be purchased in grocery stores. They also argued it isn’t likely to improve health outcomes. 
But proponents from Republican-led states argued excluding “unhealthy” foods from SNAP benefits was “common sense.” The sponsor of Utah’s bill, Rep. Kristen Chevrier, R-Highland, called it a “no brainer” way to safeguard public health and stop “subsidizing poison for kids.”
In a post on X on Wednesday, Chevrier said Utah “led the charge” by seeking the SNAP waiver while also passing HB402, another bill that banned public schools from serving food with certain food dyes and other additives in them.
“I was honored to sponsor both bills,” she wrote. “This is the beginning of a critical and long-awaited cultural revolution.”
Chevrier on Wednesday also said in a statement to Utah News Dispatch that “the decision to remove soda from SNAP funding is supported” by a recent study by Brigham Young University that suggests drinking sugar may be more problematic for health than eating it.
“Taxpayers should not be subsidizing consumption of harmful substances, and then footing the bill for resulting health issues down the road,” Chevrier said. “This was the right move for Utah and for the nation.”
The bill’s Senate sponsor, Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Pleasant Grove, also issued a statement applauding the waiver approval.
“We appreciate the swift approval of our waiver request,” Brammer said. “SNAP is intended to help individuals and families access nutritious food. However, soda, despite offering no nutritional value and contributing to health problems, remains the most commonly purchased item with SNAP benefits. This bill reflects responsible stewardship by making sure the taxpayer-funded program is used for its intended purpose, supporting essential nutrition while respecting personal freedom.”
During debate over Utah’s bill, Rep. John Hawkins, R-Pleasant Grove, said he was initially hesitant to support the bill, saying he wasn’t a “huge proponent of the government stepping in and telling people what they can and can’t consume with their food.” 
“But as I thought about it,” Hawkins said in February, “I’ve come to the conclusion that in this particular case, I think the government does have the right to say, ‘We want you to be healthy and we want to set the parameters around what you can use government subsidies for.’”

Gov. Janet Mills signed the right into law on Tuesday after the Legislature passed LD 589 earlier this month. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland), described it as an act of history. The law creates a new section in state statute that affords agricultural workers the state minimum wage, which is currently $14.65 an hour, since current laws exclude them. 
“Our laws now better reflect our values,” Talbot Ross said. “There is more to do, but today, we move forward — together, and with purpose.”
Talbot Ross said that exclusion from state law was “rooted in racism,” but updating the statute sends a message to all laborers that they “belong fully under Maine law” and should not “be paid poverty wages to do essential work.”
Many employers said the workers are already being paid minimum wage or more, but the new law will provide that all are entitled to at least that amount starting Jan. 1, 2026. It also includes provisions for yearly cost of living increases to the minimum wage, employer record keeping and penalties for violations.
The newly enacted law mirrors a proposal Mills put forward last session, but ultimately vetoed after it was changed by the Legislature’s Labor Committee to include a private right of action. What will now be in statute gives the Department of Labor exclusive authority to bring action on behalf of an employee for unpaid minimum hourly wages. 
However, the legislation also maintains any existing rights agricultural workers have.
Although some argued the law still doesn’t go far enough in offering farmworkers basic labor protections, agricultural and labor leaders around the state still praised the progress. 
“For too long, the people who put food on our table were denied even the bare minimum: the right to the state minimum wage,” said Matt Schlobohm, executive director of Maine AFL-CIO. “No more. With this bill signed into law, we’re finally ending a two-tiered system that treated farmworkers as second-class.”
The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association said the changes aren’t perfect, but “an important compromise.” 
Though the organization described it as “a bare bones policy to protect the people who…ensure that we have food on our tables,” it also thanked Talbot Ross, Mills and the others involved for “correcting an error on the law books.”
A bill seeking to grant agricultural workers the right to engage in concerted activity was also sent to Mills for her approval earlier this month. She has yet to sign it.

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — The state is pumping millions into a program that allows coastal South Carolinians to strengthen their roofs against hurricanes and other high wind events.
The SC Safe Home grant program aims to protect homes against natural disasters, in turn lowering their insurance costs. The state Department of Insurance normally awards about $3.5 million annually to homeowners, spokesperson Diane Cooper told the SC Daily Gazette.
But the Legislature provided a big boost in the budget that takes effect July 1: An additional $5.5 million will more than double the grants to $8.9 million in the upcoming fiscal year.
The boost comes as federal forecasters predict above-normal activity this hurricane season, which started June 1 and extends through Nov. 30.
“One of the major complaints I hear from my constituents is the rise in insurance premiums for wind and hail, or hurricane floods,” Sen. Tom Davis told the Gazette. “I’m always looking for ways that we can try to control the site and insurance premiums.”
The Beaufort Republican is one of the program’s original backers, pushing for its creation during his tenure as Gov. Mark Sanford’s chief of staff. Since its 2007 inception, the Safe Homes program has doled out more than 8,000 state-funded grants worth a total of $40.7 million to homeowners looking to reinforce their homes.
Homeowners can get SC grants to strengthen roofs, windows against hurricane damage

This fiscal year, 598 grants worth up to $7,500 were awarded.
The vast majority of homeowners use the money to retrofit their roof. Homeowners can also get up to $3,000 to install hurricane shutters. In all, they report saving 24% on their insurance premiums, according to the state Department of Insurance’s 2024 annual report.
With the Legislature providing more money for the program, more houses can be retrofitted.
Of the additional $5.5 million, only $2.5 million is recurring, meaning it will continue in future budgets indefinitely. That’s enough for roughly 250 grants annually.
The $3 million in one-time aid will boost the total additional grants to an estimated 650 in 2025-26, Cooper said.
The actual number of grants may be higher, depending on whether the agency needs to hire people — and if so, how many — to handle the additional workload, she said.
Regardless of the exact number of grants, it should be enough to prove the program lowers costs, Davis said.
He hopes legislators then turn the full $5.5 million into a recurring item in the budget.

“If our assumptions are correct and that retrofitting leads to a decrease in people’s premiums, that one-time money could be made recurring,” said Davis, chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee for natural resources and economic development.
According to the National Institute of Building Sciences, the nation saves $6 in future “disaster costs” for every $1 spent on mitigation.
The program, started in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, awards grants based on the homeowner’s income.
Following Katrina and other hurricanes that hit the Gulf in Texas, insurers started refusing to cover hurricane-related wind and hail damage along the coast.
The 2007 Coastal Property Insurance Reform Act was legislators’ response.
Since 2012, the number of companies writing property insurance policies has increased by more than 100, according to the Department of Insurance’s annual report.
In addition to the roof retrofits, the state also provides income tax credits to homeowners who fortify their property, worth a combined $2,500.
Since the grants don’t cover the entire retrofitting costs, the tax credits further help make the projects affordable, Davis said.
The director of the insurance agency credits Davis for the budget boost.
He’s “been a tireless advocate for strengthening coastal resilience and protecting South Carolina families,” Michael Wise, the agency’s director, said in a news release. “His leadership was critical in making this additional funding a reality, and we are grateful for his commitment to mitigation and public safety.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/roof-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo courtesy of FWP)On June 5, an aggressive food-conditioned black bear was euthanized in West Glacier, according to a news release from Glacier National Park said.
The park said another black bear and cub could be relocated or euthanized after someone left a backpack unattended and the bears found food in it.
The euthanized bear was a 4-year old female black bear. The bear consistently attempted to enter vehicles and buildings on private property inside the park and was eventually successful in entering at least one building and a vehicle.
In 2022, the bear was captured in Kalispell by Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks and relocated to Puzzle Creek, south of Marias Pass. The bear was seen in the West Glacier area last year, but the increase in food-conditioned behavior began in June of this year.
On June 7, the Going-to-the Sun Road was opened to its entirety for hiker and biker access, but was closed in the afternoon above the loop after a female black bear with a cub-of-the-year received a food reward from an unattended backpack. Wildlife rangers are attempting to discourage the bears’ bad behavior. If unsuccessful, the bears may have to be relocated or euthanized per the park’s Bear Management Guidelines.
“Once a bear receives a human food reward, it is very likely to become food conditioned,” the park said. “Food rewards can include items such as human food, trash, livestock feed, and pet food.
“Over time, food conditioned bears may become bold or aggressive in their attempts to obtain human food. Once a bear has become food-conditioned, hazing and aversive conditioning are unlikely to be successful in reversing this type of behavior, and these bears are euthanized. Food-conditioned bears are not relocated due to human safety concerns.”
The park asked visitors to never let a bear get their backpacks, don’t stop near bears on the road, and view them from at least 100 yards. It said roadside bears quickly become habituated to people, and habituated bears may learn to frequent campgrounds, where they gain access to human food.
“To protect human life and property, bears that seek human food must be lethally removed from the population,” the park said.

[…]","President Donald Trump speaks to soldiers at Fort Bragg in North Carolina to celebrate the Army's 250th birthday. (Greg Childress/NC Newsline)FORT BRAGG, N.C. – In a build up to a massive military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday to celebrate the Army’s 250th birthday, President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised soldiers at Fort Bragg for their fearlessness in keeping the nation safe and promised the name of America’s largest military base will never change again.
Trump also broke news, telling soldiers and civilians attending the celebration that he will restore the names of all bases that were named for Confederate generals but changed by Congress near the end of his first administration.
“Can you believe they changed that name in the last administration for a little bit?” Trump asked soldiers in the crowd. “Fort Bragg is in. That’s the name. And Fort Bragg it shall always remain. That’s never going to be happening again.”
Fort Bragg, which was named to honor the confederate general Braxton Bragg, had been renamed Fort Liberty and some signs leading to the military installation still carry that name. The names of the bases  names for Confederate leaders were changed to reflect a more inclusive and representative America.
Trump said the original names will be restored to Fort Gordon in Georgia, Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Lee in Virginia, Fort Picket in Virginia, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Fort Rucker in Alabama.
“We won a lot of battles out of those forts and it’s not time to change,” said Trump, who planned to make the announcement Saturday but said he couldn’t wait. “I’m superstitious.”
The Army base in Louisiana had been renamed in June 2023 for Sgt. William Henry Johnson, a Congressional Medal of Honor recipient for his exploits in World War I. The based was originally named after Confederate Gen.  Leonidas K. Polk, who was also bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana.
Tuesday’s celebration under mostly cloudy skies and intermittent showers was well attended. Soldiers began to fill the grandstands hours before Trump’s appearance. Patriotic music blared from speakers while visitors feasted on food from nearby food trucks, giving the event a county fair feel. Occasionally, military helicopters whizzed overhead, drawing the attention of both children and adults.
The crowd cheered almost uncontrollably when Trump finally arrived, fresh from viewing military readiness exercises that included howitzer live fires and a jump by more nearly 600 paratroopers.
“This week, we remember that we only have a country because we first had an army,” Trump said. “The army was first.”
Trump’s visit comes as he faces criticism for deploying Marines and the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell protests over ICE raids on immigrants in that city.

The visit also comes days ahead of Saturday’s military parade to honor the 250th birthday of the Army and to celebrate the 79th birthday of the president. Army officials estimate 200,000 attendees for the military parade in Washington, D.C. Trump has faced criticism for what some call an ostentatious display, with some of the criticism coming from within the Republican Party.
Veterans voice concerns about Trump’s deep cuts to VA
As Fort Bragg readied for Trump’s visit, retired Army major and Democratic congressional candidate Richard Ojeda  issued a statement calling out the former president’s record of what he called “betrayal toward veterans and military families.”
“As a proud veteran, I am disgusted to hear that Donald Trump will be standing on the sacred ground of Fort Bragg, shaking hands, taking photos, and pretending to care about those who wear the uniform,” Ojeda said. “Trump has no business showing his face at Fort Bragg, not after proposing 80,000 job cuts from the Department of Veterans Affairs and slashing services for those who have earned and bled for the healthcare they deserve.”
Ojeda’s comments come amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
Veterans across the state have criticized the Trump administration’s cuts to the VA. At a recent “Voices for Veterans” event in Fayetteville, a panel of veterans, VA employees and elected officials agreed that America has a moral obligation to care for members of the military after they have completed their service.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said VA nurse Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a member of the panel.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has defended the Trump administration’s planned staffing cuts, saying, “We’re going to maintain VA’s mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission essential roles like DEI officers.”
Defending the use of Marines in L.A. immigration crackdown
Turning from the celebration of the Army’s birthday, Trump attacked California Gov. Gavin Newson, blaming him and other Democratic leaders for the civil unrest in Los Angeles, which stems from the president’s immigration policy.
The president claimed the city would have burned to the ground had he not ordered California’s National Guard and several hundred Marines to Los Angeles to “protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of a vicious and violent mob.”
“It [Los Angeles] would be burning to day just like their houses were burning a number of of months ago,” Trump said, referring to the fires in Southern California earlier this year that destroyed more than 16,000 homes and structures.
Without providing proof, Trump said the “agitators” in Los Angeles are “professionals” and are well-funded.
“What you’re witnessing in California is a full-blown assault on peace, public law an order and our national sovereignty carried out by rioters … with aim of continuing  a foreign invasion of our country and we’re not going to let that happen,” Trump said.
Trump warned would-be protesters that he would not tolerate any disruptions at Saturday’s celebration in the nation’s Capitol.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth traveled to Fayetteville as well and spoke briefly ahead of Trump, pledging to rebuild the military by restoring the “warrior ethos.”
“We’re not a college or a university,” said Hegseth, who has degrees from Princeton and Harvard. “We’re not interested in your woke garbage and your political correctness.”
Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll boasted that the Army has hit recruiting goals four months ahead of schedule, signaling what he has previously said is a renewed sense of patriotism and purpose among America’s youth.
“It is undeniable that young men and women [are] joining the Army in greater numbers,” Driscoll said.
The U.S. Army has reported signing 61,000 recruits four months ahead of schedule. This year’s goal was more than 10% higher than the 55,000 recruits targeted in fiscal 2024, demonstrating a surge in interest and enthusiasm for Army service, the Army said.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)After a 2022 change left out the Mi’kmaq Nation from reform, legislation to ensure equal tax treatment among all of the Wabanaki Nations secured the approval of both chambers of the Maine Legislature this week. 
LD 982, sponsored by Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland), passed the House of Representatives and Senate on Tuesday without roll call votes. 
The bill would exempt the Mi’kmaq Nation from state sales and income tax for activities occurring on tribal trust or reservation lands and allow the Tribe to generate sales tax revenues from sales on their own lands — the same rights afforded to the other Wabanaki Nations.
The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation were granted these rights under a 2022 tax revision, also proposed by Talbot Ross, which brought them on par with the rules that apply to other tribal nations throughout the country. 
Compared to other federally recognized tribes, the Wabanaki Nations are treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations because of the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act.
But the Mi’kmaq Nation was not referred to in the Settlement Act and only received federal recognition later in 1991. Last session, the Legislature passed a law known as The Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act that put the Tribe on par with the rest of the Wabanaki Nations. 
LD 982 therefore builds upon the restoration act and the tax revision. 
This change was previously attempted last session with legislation proposed by State Treasurer Joseph Perry, then representing Bangor in the Maine House. While that bill received favorable committee and chamber votes, it got caught up in end-of-session procedural fights and ultimately died without final action when lawmakers adjourned.
The bill this session ultimately becoming law is not yet guaranteed. It has several associated costs, which means it’s likely to go to the appropriations table, where bills with fiscal notes that are not already provided for have to vie for funding. 
This bill would decrease the state’s general fund by $4,750 in fiscal year 2025-26 and $45,150 in fiscal year 2026-27. It would also result in ongoing annual transfers of $500 to the Mi’kmaq Sales Tax Fund and result in revenue decreases to the Local Government Fund. There would also be a one-time cost — $19,300 — to fund computer programming costs associated with the provisions of this bill.

The post New Bedford building poised to rise as artist space — again appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN 2023, efforts to harness arts and culture as part of New Bedford’s economic revitalization strategy were dealt a blindsiding blow. Two years later, it looks as if all’s well that ends well.  
In mid-August of 2023, the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, whose College of Visual and Performing Arts had occupied a massive 125,000-square-foot building in the heart of the city’s downtown for 22 years, abruptly announced that it was pulling up stakes and moving the program out of the building. The announcement said students would have to vacate studio space in the building by the end of the month – just as the fall semester was beginning.  
The school had moved its arts programs into the building – a shuttered department store — under a 20-year lease. During that time, the arts college’s presence in the former Star Store became an important part of the city’s burgeoning arts and culture scene, anchored by the nearby Zeiterion Theater and the New Bedford Whaling Museum.   
The university had the option to buy the building for $1 in 2021 when the lease expired. It balked but continued to make monthly rental payments for two years with an annual earmark from the state budget. From there, the story got messy, with lots of finger-pointing over who was to blame for the arts college’s exit.  
UMass Dartmouth chancellor Mark Fuller made it clear that the school had no interest in taking ownership of the building. In a letter to the university community, he said the building needed $50 to $75 million in deferred maintenance spending, which made the acquisition “financially impossible.” 
For students like Fallon Navarro, who was about to begin the last year of her master’s degree program when the building closed, it was devastating. “It was really hard,” she said. “It was my last year of graduate school, I was a ceramics major, and they were getting rid of everything I needed to get my degree.”  
Navarro soldiered through her last year, though the 30-year-old artist, who emerged as a leader of student protests against the building closure, said she probably spent half her time on advocacy work fighting for UMass to reverse course.  
That didn’t happen, but prospects for the shuttered building returning to life as a center for arts and culture suddenly seem bright.  
Last week, Mayor Jon Mitchell and the New Bedford Economic Development Council announced an agreement to have the former Star Store reopen as a “regional arts hub” under the ownership of the Arts & Business Council of Greater Boston, a nonprofit that acquired the building late last month.  
“It’s a real win,” said Tony Sapienza, president of the economic council board.  
The building owner, Paul Downey, agreed to sell it to the Boston arts nonprofit for $1 after paying the city about $500,000 to settle a tax lien on the property, according to Mitchell.  
The Arts & Business Council acts as a service organization for arts groups. Along with having the financial capacity to take ownership of buildings to preserve them for arts uses, it coordinates other services, such as pro bono legal work through its Volunteer Lawyers for Arts initiative.  
But securing property for affordable use by artists is at the center of its work, said Jim Grace, the group’s executive director, who likened it to land trusts established to preserve open space. 
Three years ago, the Arts & Business Council bought a 240,000-square-foot former mill building in Lowell with the goal of preserving the affordability of the 300- artist studio and loft living spaces there. It recently acquired and is co-developing with a local arts nonprofit a former YMCA building in the Main South neighborhood of Worcester for artist space.  
Grace said the idea of buying property to secure “creative campuses” is driven by the familiar pattern of gentrification that follows when artists bring new vitality to a community. “It gets cool, then they get kicked out. It’s been going on for 40 years,” he said.  
Sapienza said a local advisory group will be formed, drawing from city officials, and the local arts and business communities to work with the Arts & Business Council on a vision for the building’s use. It’s likely to include artist studio space as well as first floor gallery and performance space.  
After UMass left, the city used federal ARPA funds to commission a study of potential reuses of the building. The report concluded that the cost of converting the building to housing or office space would be prohibitive and that it made the most sense to use it for artist space – given the extensive retrofitting for that purpose that was done decades ago.  
The building needs a new roof and HVAC system, which Grace said could cost $5 to $6 million. But the cost of getting it in shape is not nearly as high as UMass officials had said when they waved off interest in staying, said Mitchell. The “figures UMass Dartmouth threw around were way out of the ballpark,” he said.   
Mitchell said the turn of events means the building can continue to help fuel the city’s arts and culture sector, which, though dwarfed by sectors like its fishing industry, nonetheless is a vital part of New Bedford’s revitalization strategy, generating about $300 million in annual economic output.  
“We have always been committed to the proposition that you have to create a high quality of life to support economic development,” he said. The arts, Mitchell said, are crucial to that.  
Those efforts took a big hit with the UMass arts program’s abrupt exit, but it turns out that wasn’t the last chapter.  
With the building now poised for revival as arts space, said Mitchell, “It’s a good news story.”

Details of services
Please help us celebrate Geoff’s life on Friday, June 27th from 2:00-5:00 p.m. at The Barn at Boyden Farm, 64 VT-104, Cambridge, VT 05444, with a short ceremony beginning at 2pm and refreshments to follow. All are welcome anytime.
In lieu of flowers, donations can be made in Geoff’s name to the Lamoille Restorative Center at www.lrcvt.org/donate or by mail at P.O. Box 148, Hyde Park, VT 05655.

Geoffrey Wheeler Hobart passed away unexpectedly while traveling home to Vermont from Punta Gorda, FL. He was 73 years old.
Born September 13, 1951, in Middletown, CT, Geoff was the son of the late Aaron Addison Hobart and Barbara (Stevens) Hobart Crawford. He grew up with his sister Stephanie and brothers Aaron Addison “Ron”, Jr., and Cyrus Hobart in nearby Old Greenwich.
Geoff became enamored with Kathleen Beales Bradbury while walking to the 4th of July Fireworks at Binny Park when they were thirteen. Eight years later, on August 26, 1972, they were married.
After a few stops, Geoff and Kathy moved to an old farmhouse in Belvidere, VT, with their daughter, Heather in tow. Shortly after, their son Ryan was born, and Belvidere would be home for the next 43 years. Geoff loved, and was loved by, this rural community.
Geoff was at home in the woods of Northern Vermont and found a career in them as a logging contractor for more than 30 years. His knowledge of the natural landscape was profound and his stories about the lumberjack life never failed to entertain.
As much as Geoff loved spending his work weeks in the woods, he might have loved spending his weekends on the water even more. From kayaking on the Green River Reservoir to sailing on Lake Champlain and the South Florida Coast, Geoff was constantly learning about the environment he was in, and the people who were in it with him.
Above all else, Geoff loved spending time with family and friends. His positive spirit was infectious, and people lined up to be near him. Uno on Block Island, furniture projects in his woodshop, and Gramp’s daycare are just a few of the ways Geoff made himself available to those he loved.
Geoff leaves behind his wife of 53 years, Kathleen B. Hobart of Waterville, VT, his daughter Heather Hobart and her partner Eli Moore and their children Ada and Quinn Moore, of Jeffersonville, VT, his son Ryan Hobart and his partner Janette Adrian of Gypsum, CO. He also leaves siblings Stephanie of Gloucester, MA and Cyrus of Pawcatuck, CT as well many cousins, nieces, nephews and his favorite dog, Sophie. Geoff was predeceased by his brother Ron Hobart and sisters in law Caroline “Carey” Hobart and Laura Hobart.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Democratic legislators and Gov. Tim Walz played defense on education funding this year, trying to preserve as many of their 2023 legislative gains as possible without pursuing bold new goals. 
The K-12 education bill, passed Monday, includes $25.7 billion for schools during the next two years, an increase of 4.8% over the current biennium. Although spending on education will increase in aggregate, the bill includes cuts to special education and libraries, as well as social workers, nurses and counselors. 
Overall, the 2025 Legislature passed a mostly status quo budget. 
With dark clouds on state government’s fiscal horizon, the future of public schools, educators and students will be determined to a great extent by the 2026 election. 
Special education funding facing significant future cuts
Special education aid is shouldering the largest portion of cuts to the education budget. The state will reduce the amount it reimburses school districts for special education transportation services by $15 million next school year and $28 million the following school year. Walz was first to propose the cuts. 
Federal law protects services to special education students from cuts. The reductions in state aid means school districts will have to make cuts outside of special education — or find new local revenue — to make up for the lost state aid. 
The budget agreement also creates a commission to explore ways to cut state spending on special education in the next biennium. The bill sets a target of $250 million per year in cuts for fiscal years 2028 and 2029. But that comes after the next election — and the potential for a different balance of power. The next Legislature won’t be bound by this one and can ignore the plan to cut special education funding.
Legislation approved in 2023 finally began chipping away at the nearly $800 million gap that school districts faced each year in funding for special education. That gap is commonly referred to as the “cross-subsidy” because districts pull money from their general per-pupil formula money to cover their unreimbursed costs for special education services. On average, districts were spending 12% of their general per-pupil aid to cover unreimbursed special education costs, with the amount varying from less than 5% to more than 20% in some districts.
The cuts to special education funding come at the same time that districts face uncertainty about the future of federal aid for special education. 
Preserving automatic increases to basic formula and universal school meals
Minnesota school districts can continue to expect an annual increase of at least 2% in basic per-pupil aid. The education bill preserves a provision enacted in 2023 that indexes the formula to inflation, with a minimum annual increase of 2% and a maximum of 3%. The per-pupil formula accounts for about two-thirds of all state funding for K-12 education.
For the upcoming fiscal year, the basic formula is $7,481 per pupil, a 2.7% increase from the current year. In fiscal year 2027, the amount will increase to $7,705. The state will spend $17.2 billion on general formula aid in the 2026-2027 biennium. 
Overall, state funding makes up 64% of education spending in Minnesota, with federal funding providing 8%, and the balance made up by local funding.
The state will also continue to provide funding for universal school meals. The cost is expected to grow from $584 million in the 2024-2025 biennium to $659 million in 2026-2027, or 13%.
State again funds the cost of summer unemployment insurance 
Hourly school workers, like paraprofessionals, bus drivers and culinary workers, will continue to be eligible to collect unemployment insurance during the summer. Minnesota was the first state in the nation to provide this benefit when it was enacted in 2023. House Republicans pushed to eliminate the program, while unions representing the workers, including SEIU and Education Minnesota, lobbied their DFL allies to preserve the program.
The state expects to have paid out $102 million from the initial $135 million set aside in 2023 to fund the program by the end of the fiscal year. Walz proposed adding another $40 million to the program. At the end of the regular session, the Legislature approved an additional $100 million to fund the benefit by canceling funding for the Northern Lights express train to Duluth. 
This sets up a conundrum in the future, with Democratic lawmakers seeking to stand with the workers — and the unions that represent them — while also confronting rising costs for school districts or the state or some combination. Unlike for salaried school workers, like principals and teachers, the current law does not allow districts to directly levy local taxpayers for the cost of the unemployment benefits for hourly workers. 
Delayed changes to aid to low income students
The state will delay for one more year changes to how it calculates what’s known as compensatory revenue, a form of state aid linked to the number and concentration of low-income students under federal poverty guidelines. For next school year, compensatory revenue sent to school districts will receive a boost of $55 million.
Under current law, the state was supposed to eliminate the use of paper forms for counting qualifying students, starting next school year. Instead of paper forms, the state would use enrollment in other government programs — like Medical Assistance and SNAP — to determine if a child is low income and thus qualifies their school district for more help. But going away from paper forms would mean that some students who meet the qualifications, but don’t participate in programs like SNAP or Medicaid, wouldn’t be included in the funding formula.
The Legislature will also form a task force to make recommendations about how to change the low income student formula in the future.
Cuts to libraries and student support personnel
The state will cut nearly $20 million of aid to schools that support libraries, and an additional $29 million in aid for social workers, school nurses and counselors. The cuts roll back some of the increases in funding the Democratic trifecta made in 2023. 
School library aid was first enacted in 2023, providing districts with $16.11 per pupil or $40,000 per year, whichever is greater. Starting next year, library aid will be reduced by 34% per pupil, and the minimum amount of aid per school district will be cut in half, from $40,000 per year to $20,000 per year.
The 2023 education law would have almost tripled the per-pupil amount next year for nurses, counselors and social workers. Instead, the per-pupil funding will only double to $34.32. Smaller school districts will continue to receive a minimum of $40,000 per year in aid.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-05-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

GM hopes to assemble more than 2 million vehicles per year in the U.S., focusing on plants in Michigan, Kansas and Tennessee.
In Michigan, GM will invest in Lake Orion Assembly in Lake Orion Township to begin producing gas-powered full-size SUVs and light duty pickup trucks starting in early 2027. GM said that move would help the company meet continued strong demand.
GM’s Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck will be its location dedicated to bundling the Chevrolet Silverado electric vehicle, the GMC Sierra EV, the Cadillac Escalade IQ and the GMC Hummer EV pickup and SUV. 
Other plants receiving investments include Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, Kansas and Spring Hill Manufacturing in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

“We believe the future of transportation will be driven by American innovation and manufacturing expertise,” said Mary Barra, GM chair and CEO, in a statement. “Today’s announcement demonstrates our ongoing commitment to build vehicles in the U.S and to support American jobs. We’re focused on giving customers choice and offering a broad range of vehicles they love.”
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the leaders of the Michigan Legislature praised the move, saying in a statement that GM and Michigan have a long history.
“I am grateful to GM for bringing more auto manufacturing back home to Michigan, protecting thousands of good-paying, union auto jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “Over the last few years, GM has grown their footprint in their home state, and I am proud that the state of Michigan has been a strong partner in helping them ‘build, baby, build!’”
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) thanked President Donald Trump for GM’s investment.
“This is exactly what we said would happen when he unveiled his bold tariff strategy,” Hall said. “While other politicians were paying out billions to build EV plants with small job totals, President Trump took the smarter path to bring back gas-powered production that will put more people to work and do it without handouts. President Trump took a strong stand to bring factories back to American shores and punish companies that shed American jobs to move their operations overseas. That plan is working.”
In its announcement, GM gave no indication that the tariff strategy being implemented by the Trump administration was a factor in its decision to make the investments.
Regardless, Michigan Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said the multi-billion-dollar investment would mean thousands of new auto jobs for the state.
“I am delighted by this news,” Brinks said in a statement. “Our hardworking and dedicated workforce, vibrant neighborhoods where people want to put down roots, and major advancements in economic policy make our state the natural place to make such a transformative investment.”

The department released the names of the men who are originally from 22 different countries, including India, Vietnam, Egypt, Peru and Russia.
Two men were transferred out the day after they arrived on Monday, according to Betsy Holley, a department spokesperson. Forty men remain in custody at the Anchorage jail facility. 
Holley said the men are expected to be held in the Anchorage facility for about a month. The men who were transferred were sent to Washington state, but she could not say where, she said. She referred all questions regarding where they were transferred from, their length of time in custody and the protocol for the transfers to ICE officials. 
ICE did not respond to requests for comment.
The state has an existing contract with the U.S. Marshals Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of Justice, for all federal detainees, or those facing federal charges, including awaiting hearings for immigration status or deportation. On May 1, the rate of federal reimbursement to the state increased from $202.21 to $223.70 per day.
The state policy with the U.S. Marshals Service does not specify if “federal detainees” means arrested and charged in Alaska or from out of state. 
Alaska DOC had previously detained 11 people arrested by ICE this year, as of the end of May, the Anchorage Daily News reported. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Alaska’s Corrections Commissioner Jen Winkelman was also not available for comment.
Community members rallied outside the Anchorage jail on Monday night in support of the men, drawing a crowd of over 80 people, according to Michael Patterson, an organizer with the Anchorage chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a community group and part of a small national political party. The demonstration condemned the Dunleavy administration for participating in the nationwide immigration crackdown. 
“Essentially, what has happened is that Gov. Dunleavy has turned the Anchorage Correctional Complex into an ICE detention facility,” he said by phone on Tuesday. 
He said the demonstrators are calling for the families of the men to be notified that they are in Alaska, that they receive proper medical care and that they receive adequate translation services.
“Our biggest concern in PSL Anchorage is that they’re not going to receive the proper and adequate medical care, because the Department of Corrections does not even do that for Alaskans that are in DOC custody,” he said.
The group runs a confidential 24-hour hotline to report ICE activity in Anchorage, provide resources and support, and dispatch a team of trained volunteer observers to document arrests. 
“The goal is that they’re there for documentation purposes,” said Cynthia Gachupin, a volunteer who has worked as a victims rights advocate, by phone Tuesday. “It’s not to escalate a situation or to put anybody else in danger. Because, I mean, these families are already really frightened when these things are occurring. The goal is to be able to help them, and not to make a situation more tense. But documentation of an ICE event is super important.”
She said documenting arrests helps individuals as they’re moved through ICE custody and detention, and helps families track them. “A lot of these families don’t know where their family members are. And now, if they’re moving and moving and moving them, like how are they going to get in contact with them?” she said. “It’s just really wrong, I think morally as human to human, I don’t think under any reason we should be treating people that way.”

And in April 2025 — a year after entering outpatient treatment — Ashley’s criminal case was fully dismissed after she had met every requirement of her court-ordered plan. (Stateline agreed to withhold Ashley’s full name to prevent potential retaliation in the ongoing custody case of her older child.)
When she first entered the courtroom, Ashley recalled, she felt like a “lost puppy.” But through a collaborative defense model spearheaded by the national nonprofit Partners for Justice, she found not just support but strength.
Jaya Duckworth, who has been a client advocate in Los Angeles County for two years, helped Ashley obtain an ID, fill out and sign important documents, and connect to counseling and outpatient treatment.
A high school graduate with some college experience, Ashley now plans to return to school and continue raising her 2-year-old. She’s also working closely with her defense team to regain custody of her 9-year-old daughter.
“Without her help, I don’t think I would have been reunited with my daughter,” Ashley said in an interview with Stateline. “I have my little one here now, and I know that I’m confident to step into that courthouse and keep trying.”
Her experience reflects a growing shift in public defense — one that recognizes that attorney advocacy alone often isn’t enough.
But this shift is unfolding at a time when national momentum is swinging in the opposite direction, with many political leaders renewing calls to crack down on crime through tougher sentencing and increased policing.
Cash assistance may curb recidivism among people leaving prison, study says

“There’s just so much data out there that shows that this approach doesn’t work,” said Alaina Bloodworth, the executive director of the Black Public Defenders Association. Bloodworth previously served as a public defender in Louisiana for six years. “Tough on crime is fueled by emotions. It’s not fueled or based in any type of data.
“It has not worked for us, and it definitely doesn’t work for communities of color.”
A 2019 study by the Rand Corporation and the University of Pennsylvania Law School found that holistic defense — which integrates legal, social and community support — may not only reduce jail and prison time but may also improve long-term outcomes for clients. The study, which compared holistic and traditional public defense models in New York City over a 10-year period, found that holistic representation reduced the likelihood of a custodial sentence by 16% and reduced the expected sentence length by 24%. It also saved taxpayers an estimated $160 million on inmate housing costs.
This model has quietly taken root in pockets of the country — often showing results that are difficult to ignore. As local governments weigh various budget priorities and public safety, some public defenders and advocates are making the case that holistic support isn’t an add-on, but a necessary part of effective legal representation.
“Having holistic defense gives the client the agency and autonomy that they need to decide for themselves,” said Michael Halkias, the chief public defender for Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. “And once people feel empowered to make decisions when they’re in a system that tells them they have no power, I think ultimately it helps them in the long run.”
The county’s office has had client advocates for nearly a year.
 The holistic defense model

Holistic defense, which emerged in the 1990s, pairs legal representation with social support and resources. The goal is not to excuse or overlook criminal behavior, but to address the underlying factors, such as poverty, substance use and trauma, that sometimes drive people into the justice system in the first place.
“When you meet those basic needs, it ensures that they don’t come back to the system,” Bloodworth said. “What I am not trained on is how to truly meet social needs in the way that social workers are trained or client advocates, so having a team of professionals representing someone is truly important to ensure that person actually gets the best representation.”
One of the organizations leading this shift is Partners for Justice, a national nonprofit that began operations in 2018. The group created a collaborative defense model by embedding trained client advocates directly within public defender offices, where they work alongside attorneys as part of an integrated and client-led defense team.
Some of the client advocates are recent college graduates with aspirations to go into law or public policy who commit to two-year fellowships, while others bring firsthand experience from the criminal legal system. The team’s goal is to confront the underlying causes and prevent many of the most dire consequences of criminal legal involvement.
‘Tough-on-crime’ policies are back in some places that had reimagined criminal justice

Today, Partners for Justice has placed advocates in 25 public defense agencies across 17 states including Missouri, where the program has a $1.1 million budget. Earlier this year, the organization expanded its reach through new partnerships with the Colorado State Public Defender and the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender.
Many client advocates build their own networks of local service providers to connect clients directly with the help they need.
Sometimes, it’s walking a client through a release from incarceration plan. Other times, it’s simply holding their hand in court — or showing up with something to eat.
“One of the most important parts of my job is to contribute in a small part to restoring the dignity and humanity that the system denies them,” said Duckworth, the client advocate who worked with Ashley, the 29-year-old California mother. She is one of more than 20 advocates working within the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.
The model eases the burden on overworked public defenders by allowing them to focus on legal strategy, rather than juggling the complex needs of dozens of clients at once.
“Our caseloads are high,” said New Jersey Public Defender Jennifer Sellitti. “But at the same time, we’re also creatures of, ‘I’m just going to do it all myself.’”
One of the biggest challenges, she said, was shifting that mindset.
“The biggest hurdle was trying to say to lawyers, ‘We want you just to lawyer,’” Sellitti told Stateline. “But that very, very quickly has turned into an incredible partnership in all three of our pilot offices.”
Since offering the Partners for Justice client advocate program in three offices across Atlantic, Hudson and Monmouth counties in March, Sellitti said, the offices have helped clients access treatment programs more quickly than they would through traditional routes like probation or recovery court.
The collaborative defense model also helps build trust between clients and their defense team. Some client advocates say there’s a common perception among defendants that public defenders don’t care about their clients. But many public defenders are stretched so thin that it’s nearly impossible to give each case the attention it deserves.
“We have been helpful in bridging that communication gap between the lawyers and their clients,” said Paul Boyd, a client advocate with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender in Atlantic County.
Boyd, who spent time in prison, said his background helps him build trust with clients who relate to his experience and therefore better understand the heavy caseloads their attorneys face. That connection, he said, often makes clients more willing to cooperate with their defense team.
 A fragile lifeline in Portland

Budget cuts in some states, though, could threaten the advocacy work.
A program that has helped dozens of defendants in the Multnomah County area of Oregon is now at risk of being cut from two of the county’s major law firms that offer public defense services. The county faces a $15.5 million budget shortfall driven by a pandemic-era drop in property tax revenues.
Public Defenders Were Scarce Before COVID. It’s Much Worse Now.

Among those the program has supported in Portland is a 33-year-old resident and Alaska Native who has lived there for nearly a decade. The resident, who asked that their name not be used out of concerns for safety, was arrested last fall and charged under Measure 11, Oregon’s mandatory-minimum sentencing law. A prison sentence loomed over them.
After spending nearly a month in county jail, they worked with client advocate Cierra Carlson on a release plan — outlining their goals for substance use recovery, going over the resources they wanted to be connected to and naming other steps to keep out of the criminal legal system.
“I was worried that I was going to fall through the cracks, that I was just going to be treated like a number,” they said in an interview with Stateline.
But upon release, they entered a “culturally specific” substance use treatment center that serves people of color. They secured more stable housing, and with Carlson’s help reactivated their food stamps and health insurance.
“I feel way more seen than I have in the past,” they said.
But Carlson’s position could soon be eliminated.
Under Multnomah County’s proposed budget, $621,261 in funding for client advocate or case manager positions at the Metropolitan Public Defender, a nonprofit law firm that contracts with the state to offer public defense services, and Multnomah Defenders Inc. would be eliminated — cutting all six positions across the county. It’s one of many potential cuts that county leaders are looking at to save money.










I was worried that I was going to fall through the cracks, that I was just going to be treated like a number.

Two amendments have been proposed to keep the program, though. One would fully reinstate the $621,261 in funding, while the other would allocate about $415,000, likely resulting in the loss of one or two positions.
The county board of commissioners is expected to vote to approve the proposed $4 billion budget on June 12.
Carlson said she’s worried about what might happen to her clients if the program were cut. “I have seen the difference that it can make.”
The proposed cuts come as Oregon’s public defense system is in crisis.
More than 3,700 people charged with crimes across the state currently have no legal representation, according to the latest state data. More than 1,700 others have missed their court dates after never being assigned an attorney — and now face active arrest warrants.
“Even if this program goes away temporarily, it’s not something that we are going to back away from because it is so critical to our work and to the success and safety of our community, too,” said Grant Hartley, the director of the Metropolitan Public Defender.

(Photo by Dylan Giles)A new study for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is supposed to identify possibilities for cutting overhead costs in the name of “efficiency.” A recently released chapter of the report attempts to classify the impact of bus routes using a composite route score that factors in impact, efficiency and equity. 
This efficiency study was ordered in 2024 by the governor and the General Assembly as a condition of granting RIPTA the $15 million it needed to continue operating without service cuts. But Gov. Dan McKee’s proposed budget released in January left RIPTA facing a $32.6 million budget deficit because of cost increases due to inflation, COVID relief money running out, and finally paying drivers a living wage. 
Health care and RIPTA prevail in lawmakers’ revised fiscal 2026 budget

The House version of the fiscal 2026 budget released Tuesday night includes an estimated $15 million in annual funding for RIPTA, about half of what the agency needs to maintain current service. This all but guarantees that the results of the efficiency study will be used to guide route cancellations and service reductions. While the additional revenue will help, the agency cannot “fat-trim” its way out of what now is a $17 million hole. Riders who rely on routes that scored lowest in the new study are likely to be most at risk.   
Consider the 40 bus, which received low scores, especially on impact. The 40 serves Butler Hospital, connecting riders with not only urgent psychiatric care, but also many outpatient mental health and substance abuse programs. How is this not one of the most impactful routes? Likewise, the 66 bus received an even lower score than the 40, but it provides vital service to students and staff of CCRI and URI, not to mention being a one-seat ride to the airport. Yet another example is the 73, even lower on the list, one of the only buses that serves Central Falls, the most densely populated area in our state with the largest percentage of people without driver’s licenses.
The data points do not tell these stories. To their credit, the writers of the report go out of their way to acknowledge that the data does not account for the real-world impact of low scoring routes.
 “Some routes may perform lower in terms of ridership,” the report states, “yet still benefit the network as a whole by feeding passengers into other routes, serving vulnerable populations and providing service coverage in transit-dependent neighborhoods.”
The report attempts to strike an unachievable balance, ranking routes like they are players to be cut or traded, while calling low performing routes “lifelines” and highlighting how any cuts to service will undoubtedly harm individual users. It even suggests maintaining service on the lowest scoring route, the 88, which links subsidized housing for the elderly at Simmons Village with the Cranston Walmart, because it connects people to vital services. 
Reducing service would also undermine RIPTA’s progress on the Transit Master Plan. For example, the plan calls for more crosstown and rural routes, yet many of these routes receive low scores in the efficiency study draft. For example, Pawtucket’s crosstown routes received lower scores, as well as some of the express (X) buses, like the 59X in North Smithfield and Lincoln. Yet the report also noted the importance of the route as it connects commuters to employment centers. Furthermore, park-and-ride users are often “choice” riders, who can choose to drive or take the bus. One rider noted that choice riders have a larger impact on climate change since most of their trips would otherwise be made by driving.










The report attempts to strike an unachievable balance, ranking routes like they are players to be cut or traded.


The report also highlights how important the fixed-route service is in achieving our climate goals. It states that fixed route service lowered statewide vehicle trips by 11.5 million trips and vehicle miles traveled  by over 43 million miles. Furthermore, emissions of volatile organic compounds were reduced by 96% and greenhouse gas emissions by 25%. These numbers show how RIPTA is essential to reduction in carbon emissions required by the Act on Climate. Any reductions of fixed route service would lower the environmental impact of RIPTA and increase vehicle trips and emissions.
Any reductions on fixed route service will also impact service for people with disabilities, known as RIDE. Federal law mandates that RIDE service must be offered to disabled people within ¾ mile of a bus route. However, if that fixed route service is cut, all of the RIDE service along the route will be cut as well. The RIDE service also aids in our climate goals, further lowering statewide vehicle trips by 69,400 and reduction of vehicle miles traveled by over 1.7 million miles.One RIDE participant of the “RIDE anywhere” pilot program noted, “Up until the program began, I was housebound for 5 years.”
The data points in the report tell one story. Yet the underlying message of the report actually illustrates the importance of the totality of the services that RIPTA provides. Its narrative is that we should provide RIPTA with the full $32.6 million that covers each and every one of the routes. In order to achieve our economic and climate goals, we must fully fund RIPTA and provide them with a sustainable funding source for the future, so they are not underfunded year after year.
Funding RIPTA will ensure that the routes in 37 out of 39 municipalities in Rhode Island will continue along with vital service for those with disabilities, students and commuters. Otherwise, we face service cuts that will devastate rural and suburban service and cut off transportation access for those with disabilities. Cutting service in the name of efficiency abandons the very people transit is meant to serve. To build a fair, connected Rhode Island, we must fully fund RIPTA’s $32.6 million shortfall and commit to equity as a guiding principle — not a secondary goal. Public transit isn’t just about numbers; it’s about people.

At approximately 9:45 a.m. in the Upper Geyser Basin at Old Faithful, a man was gored by a bison after a large group of visitors approached it too closely, the park said. The individual sustained minor injuries and was treated and transported by emergency medical personnel.
The incident is currently under investigation, and no further details were available Tuesday, the park said.
This is the second reported incident of a person injured by a bison in 2025.
The first occurred on May 7. There were two reported incidents in 2024 and one in 2023.
Yellowstone said wildlife can be dangerous, and people should give them space:

Wild animals can be aggressive if people don’t respect their space. It is your responsibility to stay more than 25 yards (23 meters) away from all large animals – bison, elk, bighorn sheep, deer, moose, and coyotes – and at least 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears, wolves, and cougars. If wildlife approach you, move away to always maintain these safe viewing distances.

Bison will defend their space when threatened and have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., speaks about her bill renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" on Thursday, May 8, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. (Screenshot via U.S. House Clerk livestream)The federal agency in charge of offshore oil and gas drilling announced Friday it will be rewriting its core regulations to replace all references to “Gulf of Mexico” with “Gulf of America.”
The change by the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management is only the latest in a series of actions by federal agencies, and a review of the Federal Register — the official journal of the federal government — shows most agencies have already implemented President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order, which instructed the federal government to replace the gulf’s name in official records.
That order also officially renamed Denali to Mount McKinley, the name used by the federal government between 1896 and 2015 for North America’s tallest peak.
In February and March, the domestic names committee of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names formalized the president’s order and a subsequent one by the U.S. secretary of the Interior about the Gulf of Mexico and Mount McKinley.
At Denali National Park, websites changed the name of North America’s tallest mountain within 10 days; it was listed as Denali on Jan. 28, and by Jan. 30, it was “Mount McKinley.”
The printed brochures took longer but are now updated.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which handles ocean mapping, changed the gulf’s name on ocean charts, and the U.S. Geological Survey changed the name in the Geographic Names Information System, the federal government’s core database. Even the agency in charge of the nation’s spy satellites altered its records.
As the Atlantic hurricane season begins, the National Weather Service’s National Hurricane Center has already updated its maps, and the U.S. Coast Guard changed its regulations in March.
Other agencies, including the BOEM, have taken longer to act. In late May, the federal agency in charge of pipeline safety changed its regulations.
More actions are coming, according to notices published in the Federal Register, the official daily journal of the federal government.
In August, the Federal Aviation Administration will change parts of its aviation maps to account for the new names.
Additional changes are expected in the coming months from other agencies and from states, which have been slower to act on the new names.

Trump also broke news, telling soldiers and civilians attending the celebration that he will restore the names of all bases that were named for Confederate generals but changed by Congress near the end of his first administration.
“Can you believe they changed that name in the last administration for a little bit?” Trump asked soldiers in the crowd. “Fort Bragg is in. That’s the name. And Fort Bragg it shall always remain. That’s never going to be happening again.”
Fort Bragg, which was named to honor the confederate general Braxton Bragg, had been renamed Fort Liberty and some signs leading to the military installation still carry that name. The names of the bases  names for Confederate leaders were changed to reflect a more inclusive and representative America.
Trump said the original names will be restored to Fort Gordon in Georgia, Fort A.P. Hill in Virginia, Fort Hood in Texas, Fort Lee in Virginia, Fort Picket in Virginia, Fort Polk in Louisiana and Fort Rucker in Alabama.
“We won a lot of battles out of those forts and it’s not time to change,” said Trump, who planned to make the announcement Saturday but said he couldn’t wait. “I’m superstitious.”
Tuesday’s celebration under mostly cloudy skies and intermittent showers was well attended. Soldiers began to fill the grandstands hours before Trump’s appearance. Patriotic music blared from speakers while visitors feasted on food from nearby food trucks, giving the event a county fair feel. Occasionally, military helicopters whizzed overhead, drawing the attention of both children and adults.
The crowd cheered almost uncontrollably when Trump finally arrived, fresh from viewing military readiness exercises that included howitzer live fires and a jump by more nearly 600 paratroopers.
“This week, we remember that we only have a country because we first had an army,” Trump said. “The army was first.”
Trump’s visit comes as he faces criticism for deploying Marines and the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell protests over ICE raids on immigrants in that city.

The visit also comes days ahead of Saturday’s military parade to honor the 250th birthday of the Army and to celebrate the 79th birthday of the president. Army officials estimate 200,000 attendees for the military parade in Washington, D.C. Trump has faced criticism for what some call an ostentatious display, with some of the criticism coming from within the Republican Party.
 Veterans voice concerns about Trump’s deep cuts to VA 
As Ft. Bragg readied for Trump’s visit, retired Army major and Democratic congressional candidate Richard Ojeda  issued a statement calling out the former president’s record of what he called “betrayal toward veterans and military families.”
“As a proud veteran, I am disgusted to hear that Donald Trump will be standing on the sacred ground of Fort Bragg, shaking hands, taking photos, and pretending to care about those who wear the uniform,” Ojeda said. “Trump has no business showing his face at Fort Bragg, not after proposing 80,000 job cuts from the Department of Veterans Affairs and slashing services for those who have earned and bled for the healthcare they deserve.”
Ojeda’s comments come amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
Veterans across the state have criticized the Trump administration’s cuts to the VA. At a recent “Voices for Veterans” event in Fayetteville, a panel of veterans, VA employees and elected officials agreed that America has a moral obligation to care for members of the military after they have completed their service.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said VA nurse Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a member of the panel.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has defended the Trump administration’s planned staffing cuts, saying, “We’re going to maintain VA’s mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission essential roles like DEI officers.”
 Defending the use of Marines in LA immigration crackdown 
Turning from the celebration of the Army’s birthday, Trump attacked California Gov. Gavin Newson, blaming him and other Democratic leaders for the civil unrest in Los Angeles, which stems from the president’s immigration policy.
The president claimed the city would have burned to the ground had he not ordered California’s National Guard and several hundred Marines to Los Angeles to “protect federal law enforcement from the attacks of a vicious and violent mob.”
“It [Los Angeles] would be burning to day just like their houses were burning a number of of months ago,” Trump said, referring to the fires in Southern California earlier this year that destroyed more than 16,000 homes and structures.
Without providing proof, Trump said the “agitators” in Los Angeles are “professionals” and are well-funded.
“What you’re witnessing in California is a full-blown assault on peace, public law an order and our national sovereignty carried out by rioters … with aim of continuing  a foreign invasion of our country and we’re not going to let that happen,” Trump said.
Trump warned would-be protesters that he would not tolerate any disruptions at Saturday’s celebration in the nation’s Capitol.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth traveled to Fayetteville as well and spoke briefly ahead of Trump, pledging to rebuild the military by restoring the “warrior ethos.”
“We’re not a college or a university,” said Hegseth, who has degrees from Princeton and Harvard. “We’re not interested in your woke garbage and your political correctness.”
Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll boasted that the Army has hit recruiting goals four months ahead of schedule, signaling what he has previously said is a renewed sense of patriotism and purpose among America’s youth.
“It is undeniable that young men and women [are] joining the Army in greater numbers,” Driscoll said.
The U.S. Army has reported signing 61,000 recruits four months ahead of schedule. This year’s goal was more than 10% higher than the 55,000 recruits targeted in fiscal 2024, demonstrating a surge in interest and enthusiasm for Army service, the Army said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCN0301-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)I’ve gotten used to sending my sister the same short text every once in a while.
“You guys okay?”
She’s lived in Los Angeles for more than a decade now, and has experienced enough wildfires and earthquakes that this text has become routine. Fortunately she’s stayed safe through all of them, although she did have to evacuate her home during the January fires.
I sent another one of these texts Friday night when I saw that protestors in L.A. were clashing with ICE agents who were trying to forcefully deport their friends and neighbors. She is okay, far enough away from the epicenter to stay safe, but the conflict between the People and our federal government has only heightened since then.
On Saturday, in a show of brutal force, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum calling at least 2,000 members of the National Guard into service for 60 days to “augment and support the protection of Federal functions and property,” essentially turning the armed military might of the United States against its own citizens in order to carry out these gutless ICE raids.
On Sunday morning, I strapped my son to his little chest carrier and went on a three-mile walk through parts of St. Louis. On a number of occasions, felled trees and torn-up sidewalks blocked my path, requiring me to step onto the street, which is notoriously not very safe for pedestrians. We passed by too many houses and apartment buildings without roofs and even more piles of shattered bricks.
Back on May 16, it was my sister’s turn to send that familiar text. The tornado blamed for five deaths that devastated our city and region was notable for its destruction, but will remain notable for its lasting impacts. Almost one month later, recovery efforts have barely begun, with city government ill-equipped to effectively manage them and The People’s Response needing a desperate infusion of resources and capacity.
As both Mayor Cara Spencer and former Mayor Tishaura Jones have rightfully pointed out, this is when the federal government is supposed to step in. Disaster recovery is the rightful domain of FEMA, but their response has been ‘slow-walked,’ according to Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who notably voted against funding FEMA in September of 2024, but is now practically begging the feds to come in and do their job.
With FEMA funding low and the response time slow, the other tool at the federal government’s disposal is the National Guard, which can be called in after a state declares a State of Emergency, just like Gov. Mike Kehoe did on May 19. But the federal government only deployed 40 National Guard members to help with debris clean-up, and only for one week. They’re already gone.
This juxtaposition of the situations in Los Angles and St. Louis is infuriating, and shows that our federal government under the Trump administration is more willing to deploy resources against its own citizens, rather than to help them. Some 2,000 National Guard troops helping to rebuild in St. Louis would be a godsend. But 2,000 armed National Guard troops protecting ICE agents in Los Angeles is a gestapo. 
Our federal government has not only turned against its own people, but willfully neglected their most basic duties in the process.

DemasBills mandating 48-hour response times for landlords to address hazardous conditions in rental properties and requirements for 90-day notice for rent increases were voted through a Michigan legislative committee Tuesday.
Lawmakers on the Senate Housing and Human Services Committee heard testimony earlier this month from tenants, advocacy groups and property owner stakeholders on the Tenant Empowerment Package, which aims to empower those residing in the state’s more than one million renter-occupied units.
Property owners would be required to respond within 48 hours to notice from renters that there is a need for safety-related repairs under Senate Bills 19 and 20. If the property owner doesn’t respond to being notified of the defective condition on the rental property premises, the renter could withhold rent or get the repair started themselves and deduct the cost of the repair from their rent.
When it comes towards the end of a person’s lease, if a landlord plans on increasing the rent, that landlord would have to provide current leasees a 90-day notice of the increase under Senate Bill  21.
Senate Bills 19 through 20 passed a committee vote along party lines without support from Republican members Tuesday.
Senate Bill 22, which would permit landlords to return security deposits electronically, passed through the committee unanimously.
All four bills will now move to the Senate floor for a vote by the chamber.

Spencer Cox answers questions from the media during his monthly PBS news conference in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, June 10, 2025. (Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) When thinking about Utah’s nuclear future, Gov. Spencer Cox said he wants people to think less of the giant nuclear plant where Homer Simpson works, and visualize more a picture of dozens of small modular reactors, stacking in the state over time. 
While many Utahns are still trying to wrap their heads around the idea Cox is envisioning, he has already signed a couple of memorandums of understanding with companies to help it materialize — and, he said, he wants to go big.
On May 23, Cox joined the founder of Valar Atomics, a California nuclear developer, in announcing their partnership to meet President Donald Trump’s goal to have an operational advanced reactor on American soil by July 4, 2026, at the San Rafael Energy Research Center in Emery County.

On Monday, he signed another agreement with another company for the nuclear efforts, Cox said during his monthly news conference broadcast by PBS Utah.
A plan for Utah nuclear energy industry’s foundation is taking shape 

“We’re going to be working with all of these companies. We want to find the best technology. We’re not betting on any one technology or any one company. That doesn’t make sense,” Cox said on Tuesday. “We’re betting on the idea that there is going to be a nuclear renaissance.” 
While research shows that nuclear developments usually go for a hefty price tag, Cox said that currently the initial plans won’t cost anything to the state, since the state already acquired the San Rafael Energy Lab during the 2024 legislative session and that will be one of the state’s main contributions in the agreement.
“We’re just providing space for these companies to come in and run their new technology there to see if it actually works,” Cox said. “And so that’s not going to cost us anything. The hope is it will save us down the road.”
Lawmakers did agree to fund $10 million for Cox’s Operation Gigawatt nuclear initiative; the governor said that money is for siting.
Utah has also sought to ease the regulations to make nuclear energy production a reality. First by suing the federal government in January — then still under the Biden administration — over its strict rules to permit the resource. Then, by passing big legislation to set the foundation for the state’s nuclear energy future. 
Glowing pains: Developing nuclear power could cost Utah tens of billions

The U.S. is lagging behind countries like China in the development of nuclear plants, Cox said. Now, with a new White House administration prioritizing a quicker licensing process for nuclear reactors and ordering a plan to add 300 gigawatts of nuclear energy capacity in the country by 2050, Cox believes Utah can lead the way.
“The market will decide how big that is,” Cox said, “government is not going to decide that, but we’re going to present opportunities.”
Other agreements happening across the state have centered around the construction of power-hungry data and AI centers. While Cox says he remains “fairly agnostic” on them, he believes they’ll be built in many areas of the country either way, drawing a substantial amount of energy from states’ shared grid.
“Even if we didn’t have a single data center here, we would still need to significantly increase our power production,” Cox said. “If we’re going to significantly increase our power production, we might as well put them here.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Supreme Court’s 2024 decision declaring frozen embryos children could be a factor in Alabama’s 2026 elections, particularly in the races for attorney general and Supreme Court.
The decision halted IVF treatments across the state and started a debate that is now looming over upcoming statewide elections.
Alabama Supreme Court Associate Justice Jay Mitchell wrote in a majority opinion that an 1872 law allowing civil lawsuits over the wrongful death of children also applied to frozen embryos, saying that the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act “provides a cause of action for the death of any ‘minor child,’ without exception or limitation.”

Mitchell, now running for the Republican nomination for Alabama attorney general, did not respond to interview requests. 
Democrats appear determined to use the opinion — which drew national criticism and led to a swift move from the GOP-controlled Legislature to pass a law intended to protect IVF access — in the coming race. His opponent, Pamela Casey, also seeking the Republican nomination for attorney general, publicly called IVF a “miracle.”
“Today and everyday, I am thankful for the miracle of IVF that made me a momma x2. Why does my baby boy look so grown?” Casey said in a caption of a photo of her two children on Facebook. In another post, she said, “Infertility and IVF is not political for me. It is personal.” Casey was not available for an interview.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The ruling, which stemmed from wrongful death lawsuits filed by couples whose frozen embryos were destroyed in an accident, sparked widespread alarm among patients and medical professionals. Despite the state law, advocates and patients emphasize that the future of IVF in Alabama remains uncertain and a significant concern for voters.
AshLeigh Dunham, an attorney at Magic City Fertility Law and a referee in Jefferson County’s Juvenile Court who is running as a Democrat for an Alabama Supreme Court seat, is putting her own experiences with IVF at the center of her campaign.
“I want your family to be able to get the care that they need, the medical care that they need, the food and stability that they need,” Dunham said in a phone interview Tuesday. “So that’s what I’m telling everyone is that I’m pro family. If your family needs IVF to expand and to start, then by all means, you deserve to have IVF, and a state should not actually be able to limit that.”
After years of unsuccessful treatments in Alabama and advice from her fertility doctor, Dunham and her husband traveled to Oregon in 2020. There, she experienced a “completely different” and more individualized IVF process, which led to three viable embryos and the successful birth of her daughter.
“We have very intelligent doctors, but I think right now, they’re a little bit limited in what they can do … For those who fit in the box, the clinics here are wonderful and even the ones who get more individualized care, it is great. But for me, I didn’t fit,” Dunham said.
Dunham called the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision “disdainful” and “horrendous.” She believes the ruling, which granted personhood status to embryos, creates a conflict with IVF.
“Once you create personhood status, you cannot have IVF and personhood. They cannot coexist,” Dunham said.
Corinn O’Brien, an IVF patient and head of Fight for Alabama Families, an organization advocating for IVF access in Alabama, said in an interview that IVF remains a critical issue. O’Brien, who is nine months pregnant after successful treatment, said that the temporary protection offered by the IVF immunity law is “tenuous at best and could be overturned.”
“We’re still fighting for more permanent protection of IVF, whether that be more legislation, whether that be a constitutional amendment, we’re still identifying the pathway,” O’Brien said. “I think the fact that we’re still having conversations about it shows everyone we’re not done. We still have work to do.”
O’Brien pointed to the stress and uncertainty that patients continue to face, even after the new law, due to looming legal threats, saying that families who need or have gone through IVF feel like a “political football” in the debate.
“There is nothing literally more pro-family than helping families welcome more children into the world. And that’s just common sense,” O’Brien said.
IVF providers are still concerned about long-term IVF access. Dr. Mamie McLean, an IVF provider with Alabama Fertility in Birmingham, said that infertility affects one in six couples, making it a relevant issue for many families in Alabama.
“We believe that the status of IVF treatments in our state feels like a ticking time bomb. We understand there’s still a conversation about whether the immunity law is constitutional. And to be transparent, we worry that this is a bad case, one lawsuit away from totally blowing up the immunity law and rendering us back at square one,” said McLean.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IVF-rally-Feb-28-2024-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Last week, the Nevada Film Office approved an additional $2.5 million. (Screenshot of YouTube video filmed in Allegiant Stadium promoting season one of Beast Games)Days after the death of a proposal to massively expand the state’s film tax credit program, the Nevada Film Office approved up to $2.5 million in transferrable tax credits for a reality competition show that made headlines last year for unsafe conditions for contestants and crew.
On Friday, “Beast Games,” a reality competition show hosted by Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, YouTube’s biggest content creator, was approved to receive up to $2.5 million in transferrable tax credits to film an episode of its second season at a temporary soundstage in Las Vegas near the South Point Casino. The approval comes roughly a year after a promo video for its inaugural season was approved for up to $2.2 million in transferrable tax credits.
Filming for a 24-minute YouTube video promoting season one of “Beast Games” took place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas in July 2024 and was embroiled in controversy, according to multiple news reports and a class-action lawsuit.
Reporting from KSNV, New York Times and Time quote “Beast Games” contestants alleging that they were not properly fed or given access to their prescribed medications and did not receive adequate medical care after being injured in physical challenges. Contestants described the staff as overwhelmed and unprepared for the scope of the production, which involved 2,000 contestants attempting to earn one of 1,000 available spots.
The Nevada Labor Commissioner’s Office told the Nevada Current no complaints against the production have been filed with them.
The class-action lawsuit was filed in September in California against Donaldson, “Beast Games” and associated production companies. The contestants alleged numerous labor code violations and sexual harassment against women contestants.
The lawsuit alleges producers “knowingly misclassified” contestants on their 2024 film tax application “in part, to obtain a tax credit” they “would not have received if they had disclosed the Production’s actual labor costs,” according to a redacted copy of the  lawsuit published byVariety and KSNV.
Contestants on unscripted reality or game shows are not typically considered employees, though there is an evolving conversation on that as a labor issue at the national level.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs could not be reached for comment.
Spokespeople for MrBeast declined to respond to specific questions about the lawsuit or public allegations about the conditions of their production last year. In a provided statement, they said last year’s shoot in Las Vegas was “unfortunately complicated by the CrowdStrike incident,” referring to a nationwide IT outage that affected millions of Windows systems, “extreme weather, and other unexpected logistical and communications issues, which we reviewed.”
The statement added that “virtually all of those invited to Toronto” where the full inaugural season was filmed “enthusiastically accepted.”
The Governor’s Office of Economic Development, which houses the Nevada Film Office, did not respond to specific questions from the Current asking if they are looking into any of the allegations related to the filming of “Beast Games” last year, or whether the allegations were considered when approving additional tax credits.
GOED spokesperson Carli Smith in a statement said the office is “aware of the ongoing lawsuit” and “actively tracking developments.” She added that the production has not completed a required third-party audit and therefore has not received any tax credits from the state.
 
How the film tax credit program works
Production companies can apply with the Nevada Film Office to receive transferable film tax credits equaling a certain percentage of qualified expenses. Because their own tax liability is less than the amount of tax credits they receive, the companies sell them to other Nevada companies at less than face value, though the state accepts them as payment at full face value. The procedure provides a financial subsidy to the tax credit recipients (the tv or film production company), and a tax break to the tax credit purchasers (typically gaming or insurance companies).


A delay of over a year between the approval of tax credits and the issuance of them is not uncommon. According to GOED, projects involving post-production have up to 270 days after post-production wraps to submit a third-party audit, which is required before any tax credits are issued. A 90-day extension can also be requested.
Off One’s Base, the North Carolina-based independent production company that filed for the tax credits for “Beast Games” season one is still within that window of time.
Audits are not considered public records, though companies can approve requests to make them public. The final amounts issued are reported by GOED within their annual reports.
Friday’s hearing for the $2.5 million in transferable tax credits for “Beast Games” season two was brief, with GOED staff and an executive producer restating details included in their public application. This year’s application was filed by Trailblazer Events, a North Carolina-based production company associated with MrBeast.
The same point of contact was listed on both applications.
According to its film tax credit application, Episode 201 of “Beast Games” season two will be shot entirely in Las Vegas with a budget of approximately $22.1 million, approximately $17 million of which covers what are considered qualified expenses for film tax credits. The budget includes $9.4 million in set construction and $2.2 million in wages to Nevada residents.
“Beast Games” was promoted as having the “largest cash prize, most contestants, and most cameras ever” with 1,000 people competing for a $5 million grand prize. The 10-episode season aired on Amazon Prime Video in December. The promotional video featuring Allegiant Stadium streamed on YouTube.
Amazon last month announced there would be two additional seasons and called “Beast Games” the “most-watched unscripted show ever, amassing 50 million viewers.” 
Locally, the reaction was more mixed. KSNV quoted the production’s “contestant wranglers” alleging they were unable to call for medics when needed and were asked to clean a sleeping bag covered in human excrement.
A spokesperson for MrBeast in a statement to the Current said the company “communicated directly” with 97% of the 2,000 people who participated in last year’s Las Vegas shoot to ask for feedback, adding they “took the necessary steps to ensure that we learned from this experience and continue to comply with standard industry rules and regulations.”
MrBeast operates the most-subscribed channel on YouTube and is known for outrageous stunts and giving away money. The 27-year-old, based in Greenville, North Carolina, had 320 million subscribers on his main account and nearly 9 billion views last year, according to Forbes, which named him the internet’s top creator in 2024.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-6-9-25-at-1.41 PM-1024x574.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

These are the opening words of the 2025 KIDS COUNT® Data Book released this month to give us a broad overview of how children are doing across the country. And right now, the data is telling us that we need to do more to meet the needs of kids in Michigan.
Each year, the Data Book ranks states along four domains — economic security, education, health, and family and community — using 16 indicators of child well-being from trusted state and federal data sources. This year’s data shows that progress is happening in Michigan. More children have access to health insurance, fewer children live in high-poverty areas and fewer children are being born to teens. But other areas highlight the need for urgent policy action.
By far the area of greatest concern in Michigan is in education. Michigan is ranked 44th nationally — in the bottom ten states and the lowest in the Midwest. Academic performance has worsened nationally, but Michigan’s outcomes are particularly concerning, as the vast majority of students are not proficient in basic skills. 
Michigan ranks 33rd for child well-being in annual report with education among the nation’s worst

The poor ranking is driven primarily by the worsening trend in fourth-grade reading proficiency, where we outperform only three states. Just 1 in 4 students in Michigan is proficient in fourth-grade reading. This trend highlights the unprecedented learning loss during and after the pandemic and the extreme toll chronic absenteeism is taking on academic performance.
Some of this is a reflection of how we invest in students and schools. In a recent report, EdTrust-Midwest demonstrated how Michigan’s education revenue growth has not kept up with other states, leading to persistent underfunding for at-risk students for many years. Although Michigan’s new Opportunity Index provides a roadmap to addressing these inequities, legislators in Michigan have failed to provide adequate funding.
The challenges facing schools, teachers and students will only grow in the coming months as Michigan House leadership has willfully refused to lay out a budget proposal, threatening the ability of districts to plan for the upcoming school year. Meanwhile, both the Senate and governor have proposed a budget that fails to provide increased funding for weights for students at the highest risk: students who are economically disadvantaged, students with disabilities and English-language learners.
Addressing the needs of students also extends beyond the classroom, including ensuring children have access to a warm bed at night, healthy food to eat and a safe way to get to school. All children deserve to have their needs met, and policymakers have a responsibility to meet those needs by making smart policy choices guided by data and evidence. 
In 2023, 18% of children in Michigan — more than 365,000 young people — were living in poverty. One in 4 children (more than half a million in total) lived in a household where the family spent more than 30% of their income on housing, a financial burden that makes it difficult for families to afford other essentials.
Unfortunately, right now many of the most successful programs to meet the needs of children and young adults are being threatened in Congress. Access to health care, food assistance, and the Child Tax Credit are all under attack from lawmakers who care more about providing tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations than the well-being of the children living here in our state.
If we want to give our kids the best chance to thrive in adulthood and in the workforce, we need to position them for success now by supporting family economic security and access to programs and services that are essential for children’s healthy development. As our state and federal lawmakers work on passing their respective budgets this summer, we call on leaders to act boldly where needed and rely on what we know works.

The best thing we can do as Vermonters is urge our friends and family in Republican states to advocate for keeping the IRA tax credits.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alex Messinger: Passing the ‘big beautiful bill’ will cost Vermonters big time.","This commentary is by Alex Messinger of Burlington. He is co-leader of the Vermont Chapter of Citizens’ Climate Lobby.


On May 22, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget bill that drastically cuts America’s clean energy tax credits, which are part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022. The bill now moves to the Senate.
Senators have the opportunity to protect those credits, which are expected to deliver 12,000 jobs and generate $500 million in additional new income for Vermonters over the next 10 years. If these credits are ultimately cut, we’ll lose this boost to our economy, all Vermonters will face increased energy costs and those who want to make upgrades will miss out on thousands of dollars in incentives for things like heat pumps, energy efficiency upgrades and solar panels.
Housing and energy costs are too high for Vermonters already. Vermont households spend an average of $7,000 on energy costs per year, the third-highest in the country relative to income. If the IRA’s clean energy tax credits go away, national residential electricity rates will increase by an average of 7% by 2029. Fewer clean energy projects will be financially viable.
This means fewer clean and cheap power sources will be deployed at a time when electricity demand is expected to rise quickly due to rapidly expanding data centers, artificial intelligence, electrification of vehicles and buildings and air-conditioning use as temperatures rise. Less supply means more demand and energy prices go up. 
Low-income Vermonters will be especially hard hit. Through the rebates available in the IRA, they can save an average of 42% on home energy bills when they upgrade their energy efficiency. Also at risk is the $22 million grant awarded in March 2025 as part of the Solar for All program, which helps install solar power on low-income housing.
Tax credits are designed to be a temporary measure, but stopping them quickly is bad for business. The IRA tax credits are supposed to last at least until 2028. The current House bill ends many programs by the end of 2025.
This week I have spoken with three different solar installers who do work in Vermont and the rest of New England. They all say the same thing — reducing these credits abruptly would cause a short-lived spike in demand, but then a steep drop in in their solar business.
There’s one clear reason why solar, heat pumps and other clean energy are on the chopping block — they are so successful that they are a threat to the fossil fuel industry. Solar is the fastest-growing source of energy and the second-cheapest to build after wind energy.
And for the past 3 years, heat pumps have outsold gas furnaces nationally. If you want to join the over 60,000 Vermont households and businesses that already have a heat pump, you’re going to pay thousands of dollars more for it without the IRA tax credits.
While our Sens. Welch and Sanders support these tax credits, it’s not enough. Even if every Senate Democrat supports maintaining these tax credits in the reconciliation bill, it’s still not enough.
We need Republican Senators across the country to stand up to the pressure to vote for this bill. Many of these Senators would lose billions of investment dollars and thousands of jobs in their home states if the IRA tax credits are repealed. 
The best thing we can do as Vermonters is urge our friends and family in Republican states to advocate for keeping the IRA tax credits. The numbers are clear: clean energy tax credits are working for Vermont. Undoing them now — as the House just voted to do — would be reckless and harmful.

Right now, Republican lawmakers are advancing the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — a sprawling, 1,100-page proposal that aims to change everything from tax incentives for electric vehicles to health care. It also includes a proposal to end taxes on tips, which could potentially affect around 4 million American workers. The Senate has recently passed its own version – the No Tax on Tips Act.
The idea started getting attention when Trump raised it during a 2024 campaign stop in Las Vegas, a place where tipping is woven into the economy. And the headlines and press releases sound great — especially if you’re a waiter, bartender or anyone else who depends on tips for a living. That may be why both Democrats and Republicans alike broadly support the concept. However, like most of life, the devil is in the details.
I’m a business-school economist who has written about tipping, and I’ve looked closely at the language of the proposed laws. So, what exactly has Trump promised, and how does it measure up to what’s in the bills? Let’s start with his pledge.
 The promise of money that’s ‘100% yours’

Back in January 2025, Trump said, “If you’re a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, one of my caddies … your tips will be 100% yours.” That sounds like a boost in tipped workers’ income.
But when you look at the current situation, it becomes clear that the reality is far more complicated.
First, the new tax break only applies to tips the government knows about — and a lot of that income currently flies under the radar. Tipped workers who get cash tips are supposed to report it to the IRS via form 4137 if their employer doesn’t report it for them. If a worker gets a cash tip today and doesn’t report it, they already get 100% of the money. No one really knows what percentage of tips are unreported, but an old IRS estimate pegs it at about 40%.
What’s more, the current tax code defines tips only as payments where the customer determines the tip amount. If a restaurant charges a fixed 18% service charge, or there’s an extra fee for room service, those aren’t tips in the government’s eyes. This means some tipped workers who think service charges are tips will overestimate the new rule’s impact on their finances.
 How the new bills would affect tipped workers

The “Big Beautiful Bill” would create a new tax code section under “itemized deductions” This area of the tax code already includes text that creates health savings accounts and gives students deductions for interest on their college loans.
What’s in the new section?
First, the bill specifies that this tax break applies just to “any cash tip.” The IRS classifies payments by credit card, debit card and even checks as “cash tips.” Unfortunately for workers in Las Vegas, noncash tips, like casino chips, aren’t part of the bill.
While the House bill limits the deduction to people earning less than US$160,000 the Senate bill caps the deduction to the first $25,000 of tips earned. Everything over that is taxed.
Second, the current House bill ends this special tax-free deal on Dec. 31, 2028. That means these special benefits would only last three years, unless Congress extends the law. The Senate bill does not include such a deadline.
Third, the exemption is only available to jobs that typically receive tips. The Treasury secretary is required to define the list of tipped occupations. If an occupation isn’t on the list, the law doesn’t apply.
I wonder how many occupations won’t make the list. For example, some camp counselors get tips at the end of the summer. But it’s unclear the Treasury Department will include these workers as a covered group, since counselors only make up a proportion of summer camp staff. Not making the list is a real problem.
And while the new proposal gives workers an income tax break, there’s nothing in either bill about skipping FICA payments on the tipped earnings. Workers are still required to contribute slightly more than 7% in Social Security and Medicare taxes on all tips they report, which won’t benefit them until retirement. This isn’t an oversight — the bill specifically says employees must furnish a valid Social Security number to get the tax benefits.
There are a few other ways the legislation might benefit workers less than it seems at first glance. Instituting no taxes on tips could mean tipped employees feel more pressure to split their tips with other employees, like busboys, chefs and hosts. After all, these untipped workers also contribute to the customer experience, and often at low wages.
And finally, many Americans are tired of tipping. Knowing that servers don’t have to pay taxes might make some to cut back on it even more.
The specifics of any piece of legislation are subject to change until the moment Congress sends it to the president to be signed. However, as now written, I think the bills aren’t as generous to tipped workers as Trump made it sound on the campaign trail.

LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, is accused of shoving federal authorities during a scuffle outside an ICE jail in Newark last month.","Rep. LaMonica McIver, a Democrat, is accused of shoving federal authorities during a scuffle outside an ICE jail in Newark last month. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment against a New Jersey congresswoman who is accused of shoving federal authorities while Mayor Ras Baraka was being arrested for trespassing at an ICE jail in Newark last month, the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced Tuesday. 
The indictment charges Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) with assaulting, resisting, impeding, and interfering with federal officers, according to a copy obtained by the New Jersey Monitor (Habba’s office did not release it Tuesday). Habba said the three charges carry a maximum penalty of 17 years in prison total.
“As I have stated in the past, it is my Constitutional obligation as the Chief Federal Law Enforcement Officer for New Jersey to ensure that our federal partners are protected when executing their duties.  While people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve. Today’s decision by the grand jury is the next step in a process that my Office will pursue to a just end,” Habba wrote on social media.
McIver in a statement called the grand jury proceedings “a brazen attempt at political intimidation.” She said she’ll be entering a plea of not guilty. 
“This indictment is no more justified than the original charges, and is an effort by Trump’s administration to dodge accountability for the chaos ICE caused and scare me out of doing the work I was elected to do,” McIver said. “But it won’t work — I will not be intimidated.” 
McIver was initially charged on May 19, about a week after Baraka was arrested outside Delaney Hall, a privately owned migrant jail that recently reopened amid President Donald Trump’s mass detention and deportation efforts. Authorities later dropped the charge it filed against Baraka.
McIver and two other New Jersey House Democrats, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, were visiting the jail May 9 for an unannounced visit, which is permitted by members of Congress. Baraka, a Democrat who at the time was running for governor, was there to check on the facility, which he had claimed owner Geo Group opened without obtaining proper city permits.
The indictment alleges the House members entered a secure area of the property while a gate opened to let a vehicle enter. It claims Baraka said he was part of the congressional members’ entourage, was denied entry, and then allowed on the property when a guard working at the facility “became concerned for (his) safety amidst the crowd of protesters.”
According to the indictment, Baraka was soon asked to leave the property, and a scuffle broke out when authorities moved to detain the mayor. When an agent announced Baraka would be placed under arrest, McIver shouted, “Hell no! Hell no!” the indictment says. She then ordered others to circle the mayor in an attempt to “thwart the arrest,” according to the indictment. 
Department of Homeland Security officials have released videos that show McIver pushing past a federal agent and pushing another one on his shoulder. A complaint filed against her last month claims McIver “slammed” her arm into an agent and tried to grab another. 
McIver has maintained that she was acting lawfully and that the federal agents created an “unnecessary and unsafe confrontation” when handcuffing Baraka. 
Paul Fishman, attorney for McIver, said the legal process will expose the charges she faces as “political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities.”
Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, blasted the indictment as “an outrageous and unprecedented escalation of the Trump administration’s intimidation campaign against those who refuse to do its bidding.” 
“All public officials must immediately denounce this indictment,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “Members of Congress must leverage their oversight powers to provide strong checks and balances on the Trump administration’s shameful intimidation campaign and its cruel mass detention and deportation agenda.” 
Last week, Baraka filed a lawsuit charging federal officials with malicious prosecution and false arrest.
Habba has previously said she is investigating Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin over the state’s directive banning local law enforcement from assisting in civil immigration enforcement.
McIver, who represents parts of Hudson, Union, and Essex counties, including Newark, first joined Congress in September.

We need to move forward toward a public school system that provides equal and better educational quality, with community control and lower costs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jim Lengel: Next steps for education reform.","This commentary is by Jim Lengel of Duxbury and Lake Elmore. He started teaching in Vermont in 1972, worked for the State Board of Education for 15 years, and retired back in Vermont after helping schools all over the world improve the quality of teaching and learning.


Our executive and legislative branches have failed during this biennium to come up with a workable education reform. It’s too late now to hash out a useful solution, but that’s no reason to give up.
Instead, we need to move forward toward a public school system that provides equal and better educational quality, with community control and lower costs. Here are the next steps, along with a timeframe.
1. Design sustainable K-12 districts. 2025-2026
Our current hodgepodge of 251 towns, 120 school districts, 53 supervisory unions and untold numbers of merged, unified, contract and union districts is irrational, expensive, unsustainable and not in the best interests of students. Instead, a revived State Board of Education should design new districts around where our students live, where our schools are located and the existing organic patterns of sending and receiving schools.
Each district should include at least one high school along with its sending elementary and middle schools. Most of our public education works this way already, accounting for 90% of our students. For those few places where the K-12 pattern is confused, the Board will help the communities develop a solid solution.
2. Work with communities to improve K-12 quality and equity. 2025-ongoing
The State Board should define, in broad outlines, and with deep community involvement, the elements of a quality education: the experiences and opportunities each Vermont student should enjoy at elementary, middle and high school. Most of the new K-12 districts will already meet these standards; some of the lower-spending ones may not.
With help from the State Board, these districts will develop a plan for improvement. At the same time, a few high-spending districts may need to examine how they might lower costs with the least effect on quality. The State Board will assist them in this process.
3. Design a funding system to support these districts. 2026-2027
Once new districts are defined, we can calculate the value of property and income in each, as a first step in developing a funding system that provides enough support for each district to maintain the elements of a quality education. We expect to find a narrower range of taxable value per student among the larger K-12 districts, thus reducing the need for statewide equalization.
As part of the funding plan, the two main drivers of increased school costs — health insurance and special education — need to be dealt with on a statewide basis.
The new governance, quality and funding system should ensure that each Vermont student, regardless of ZIP code, enjoys a quality education, under community control, with an equal share of public resources.

Wahls said he is running to support “hardworking” families and to fix the problems he and other Iowans are facing, like the high cost of groceries, child care and medications. 
“Government isn’t listening to Iowans,” Wahls said in an interview. “It’s not working for us. Iowans who are working hard are just falling further and further behind.”
Wahls is a sixth-generation Iowan who was elected in 2019 as senator for District 43. Prior to that, he was known for his LGBTQ+ activism.

Wahls joins Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, and Democrat Nathan Sage of Indianola, who have announced candidacy runs against Ernst, following comments she made during a recent town hall event. 
Ernst, while talking at a town hall meeting about federal cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, said “we all are going to die” in response to an attendee who yelled that the cuts would cause people to die. Following the town hall, Ernst posted a sarcastic apology video and said, during an appearance on WHO Radio, she does not regret how she spoke. 
Ernst has not officially launched a campaign for reelection, but has hired a campaign manager. Her comments have drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle and led several to announce their plans to run for the seat. 
Wahls said he and his wife were already considering how they could “fight for (their) fellow Iowans” in the upcoming election cycle, but Ernst’s comments “show how she has lost touch with Iowans.” 
“Her tone deaf, double down the next day was bizarre, and I think underscored for me how important it is that a new generation of leaders step up and try to actually get things done in Washington,” Wahls said. 
Across the aisle, former state legislator Jim Carlin from Sioux City also launched a run for the seat following Ernst’s comments. 
Nick Puglia, regional press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Iowa Democrats have a “messy” line up of candidates.
“Now Wahls and the other radicals will fight to see who supports males in women’s sports and opposes the deportation of violent illegal immigrants the most,” Puglia said in a statement.
Wahls was the Senate Democratic leader in 2021, but was removed from the role in 2023 following a disagreement over the termination of two staff members. 
Wahls said the history shows he is willing to stand “up to the establishment.” 
“I’ve never been afraid of a tough fight, and I think that’s going to serve me well,” Wahls said.

(Drazen via Getty Images)School voucher programs that allow families to use public funds to pay tuition to attend private schools have become increasingly popular.

Thirteen states and the District of Columbia currently operate voucher programs.
In addition, 15 states have universal private school choice programs that offer vouchers, education savings accounts and tax credit scholarships. Indiana’s new state budget funds universal vouchers in the second year.
More states are considering school choice and voucher programs as the Trump administration advocates for widespread adoption.
School vouchers have a long history in the U.S.
The first vouchers were offered in the 1800s to help children in sparsely populated towns in rural Vermont and Maine attend classes in public and private schools in nearby districts.
After the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, in which justices ruled that separating children in public schools on the basis of race was unconstitutional, segregationists used vouchers to avoid school integration.
More recently, school voucher programs have been pitched as a tool to provide children from low-income families with quality education options.
As a scholar who specializes in education policy, law and politics, I can share how current policies have strayed from efforts to support low-income Black children.
History of school voucher programs
Research from education history scholars shows that more recent support for school choice was not anchored in an agenda to privatize public schools but rooted in a mission to support Black students.
Over time, as school voucher policies grew in popularity, they evolved into subsidies for middle-class families to send their children to private and parochial schools.
School choice policies have also expanded to include education savings account programs and vouchers funded by tax credit donations.
Vouchers can redirect money from public schools, many of which are serving Black students.
Impact on public schools
States looking to add or expand school choice and voucher programs have adopted language from civil rights activists pushing for equal access to quality education for all children. For example, they contend that school choice is a civil right all families and students should have as U.S. citizens. But school voucher programs can exclude Black students and harm public schools serving Black students in a host of ways, research shows.
  School voucher programs can negatively impact the quality of public schools serving Black students.(Connect Images via Getty Images)
This impact of voucher programs disproportionately affects schools in predominantly Black communities with lower tax bases to fund public schools.
Since the Brown v. Board ruling, school voucher programs have been linked to racial segregation. These programs were at times used to circumvent integration efforts: They allowed white families to transfer their children out of diverse public schools into private schools.
In fact, school voucher programs tend to exacerbate both racial and economic segregation, a trend that continues today.
For example, private schools that receive voucher funding are not always required to adopt the same antidiscrimination policies as public schools.
School voucher programs can also negatively impact the quality of public schools serving Black students.
As some of the best and brightest students leave to attend private or parochial ones, public schools in communities serving Black students often face declining enrollments and reduced resources.
In cities such as Macon, Georgia, families say that majority Black schools lack resources because so many families use the state’s voucher-style program to attend mostly white private schools.
Moreover, the cost of attending a private or parochial school can be so expensive that even with a school voucher, Black families still struggle to afford the cost of sending children to these schools.
Vouchers can siphon school funding
Research from the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank based in Washington, D.C., shows that voucher programs in Ohio result in majority Black school systems such as the Cleveland Metropolitan School District losing millions in education funding.
This impact of voucher programs disproportionately affects schools in predominantly Black communities across the U.S. with lower tax bases to fund public schools.
Another example is the Marion County School District, a South Carolina system where about 77% of students are Black.
Marion County is in the heart of the region of the state known as the “Corridor of Shame,” known for its inadequate funding and its levels of poor student achievement. The 17 counties along the corridor are predominantly minority communities, with high poverty rates and poor public school funding because of the area’s low tax base due to a lack of industry.
On average, South Carolina school districts spent an estimated US$18,842 per student during the 2024-25 school year.
In Marion County, per-student funding was $16,463 during the 2024-2025 school year.
By comparison, in Charleston County, the most affluent in the state, per-student funding was more than $26,000.
Returning voucher policy to its roots
Rather than focus on school choice and voucher programs that take money away from public schools serving Black students, I argue that policymakers should address systemic inequities in education to ensure that all students have access to a quality education.
Establishing restrictions on the use of funds and requiring preferences for low-income Black students could help direct school voucher policies back toward their intent.
It would also be beneficial to expand and enforce civil rights laws to prevent discrimination against Black students.
These measures would help ensure all students, regardless of background, have access to quality education.

(Getty Images)The Indiana Department of Correction owes Indiana jails about $12.7 million in payments for housing state offenders — but there is a plan in place to pay it back starting July 1 and avoid the problem in the future.
The state prison system exhausted its appropriation for jail payments earlier this year. At the time, it wasn’t clear how much money counties were losing.
But the DOC provided a spreadsheet showing a county-by-county tally of the arrears. Elkhart County has the highest bill at $1 million with Allen and Marion counties following.
Capt. Michael Culp with the Elkhart County Sheriff’s Office said the county last received a payment from the state in August 2024.


Here are the top five counties in terms of payments owed by the Indiana Department of Correction:

Elkhart – $1,027,837
Allen – $772,982
Marion – $751,237
St. Joseph – $531,187
Delaware – $401,957



He said, on average, the county houses between 40-50 inmates that are sentenced to DOC. The prison system will generally only accept 20 inmates at a time, which leads to a higher than normal DOC committed population, with longer stays in the jail.
Allen County’s jail is a $20-million operation and Auditor Nick Jordan said the $773,000 owed by the state would fund “a handful or two of confinement officers.” Without that state reimbursement, the county has to rely on property and local income tax revenue.
Annie Goeller, spokeswoman for DOC, said the new fiscal year begins July 1 and the agency has a plan to send the money owed once the funding is received from state budget officials.
“The budget bill addressed a number of issues surrounding county jail payments, including the amount funded per year, when payment requests must be submitted and paid, and the per diem rate,” Goeller said. “DOC is also working on a plan to ensure compliance with this legislation.”
Stephen Luce, executive director of the Indiana Sheriffs’ Association, applauded DOC and legislative leaders for working with sheriffs to make the situation right.
“This is going to be good for the counties, and at the same time I know Commissioner (Lloyd) Arnold is really making this a priority to make sure moving forward that a good process is in place,” he said.
Luce said DOC officials are going to come to the sheriffs’ annual conference in July to give an update.
Background
The appropriation in the current state budget, which ends June 30, was $34 million for the county jail maintenance contingency fund. The fund reimburses sheriffs for two groups of offenders: anyone convicted of a Level 6 felony, as well as anyone being held on higher felonies or parole for IDOC.
Of that amount, up to $25.3 million was set aside for the Level 6 felons at a rate of $40 per day. This group of offenders used to be sent to state prisons until a criminal justice overhaul in 2013. After that, low-level felons were kept in local jails at state expense.
The new state budget increased the line item to $45 million the first year and $41 million the second year.
Luce said the daily per diem rate was also increased to $42, which is “better than nothing.”
A study by the sheriff’s association found costs average about $74 a day to cover inmates. They had hoped to increase the rate to a minimum of $50 to $60 a day but a dismal revenue forecast limited new spending in the budget.
Jordan said the “lack of money has been ongoing for years” and even $42 is still woefully short of the average cost of $60 per day, per inmate to run the Allen County Jail.
Culp said the $42 is also less than the cost to Elkhart County, which averages $55 to $125 per day. The difference in cost is dependent on an inmates needs, such as mental health or other medical issues.
Also significantly, Luce said the budget bill creates a more direct reimbursement of the costs rather than a formula the state used in the past. Now counties must submit their numbers within 60 days.
“They’re going to try to create a traditional billing system instead of using a formula based off of level six holds, which honestly I don’t think it really reflected a good solution for housing,” he said. “I think going to the traditional one is probably going to be much better off moving forward.”

(John Gray/Verite News)On May 16, 10 inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Prison through a hole cut in the wall. Even though they ran in front of a security camera, they were not immediately seen escaping because the deputy in charge of watching the camera left his post to get some food.
Six of the inmates are charged with murder or attempted murder. Nine of the inmates are awaiting trial. One has been sentenced. Eight of the inmates have been captured as of publication, and two remain at large. Thirteen people have been charged with either helping the inmates escape or providing shelter for them after the escape.
The escape took place about two months before qualifying begins on July 11 for all municipal elections, including mayor, city council, and sheriff. The primary is Oct. 11 and the runoff is Nov. 15. Most public opinion polls taken over the last few years list crime as one of the top concerns for voters.
The sheriff is responsible for security of the prison, so the election for that office has the most potential to be affected by the jailbreak. However, according to the Bureau of Governmental Research, $71.8 million, or about 79% of the sheriff’s budget, is actually allocated by the city council and approved by the mayor. The sheriff’s office is the third largest city budget item behind police and fire departments.
Given the role of the mayor and city council in controlling most of the sheriff’s budget, those elections will be affected by the jailbreak. Candidates for mayor and council should expect to receive questions about prison operation at their forums, and voters should factor in candidate plans for the operation of the prison when determining their votes.
Even before the jailbreak, Sheriff Susan Hutson experienced political turbulence. In 2023, she requested an increase of property taxes from 2.8 mills to 5.5 mills for her office. The millage increase was defeated soundly by the voters 91% to 9%. On May 3 of this year, a renewal of an existing 2.4 mill tax just barely passed by razor-thin margins of two votes on election day, and four votes after a recount was taken. Had the renewal failed, the office would have lost 13.1 million dollars in annual revenue. Many observers saw opposition to the millage as an expression of dissatisfaction with Hutson herself, rather than the actual millage.
The struggles getting the millage passed followed several years of negative publicity for Hutson. This publicity included outbreaks of violence in the jail, and complaints from former supervisors that they were fired without cause, and then replaced by friends of the sheriff without law enforcement qualifications. The office is also under a federal court consent decree, and received criticism from the consent decree monitor that Hutson was not forthcoming about how she managed her budget, or her plan to reduce violence in the prison.
The jailbreak added to this long series of issues. In response to the jailbreak, Hutson announced that she was suspending her reelection campaign to focus all of her energy on dealing with the crisis, although she has not formally dropped out.
On June 2, pollster John Couvillion released a poll that showed 63% of the respondents had an unfavorable view of Hutson. There are currently three announced candidates running against the sheriff. Former NOPD Interim Police Chief Michelle Woodfork, Second City Court Constable Edwin Shorty, and retired Criminal District Court Judge Julian Parker have all announced their candidacies.. The Couvillion poll had Woodfork leading with 35%, Hutson at 12%, Shorty at 9%, Parker at 3%, and 42% undecided.
The city council has been active in investigating the causes of the jailbreak. Council members called a series of special meetings to question Hutson and members of her staff. The sheriff responded that, while she takes responsibility, the main cause of the escapes is insufficient funds to hire more staff and to improve the locks inside the jail. She requested more money for emergency repairs. The council was skeptical that lack of funds is the cause, and wants to see the Hutson manage her current allocation in a more efficient manner.
The next mayor and council, in their roles controlling most of the sheriff’s budget, will need to work as a team with the sheriff to improve the security and operation of the prison. Voters should also ask the mayoral and council candidates how they would improve the operation of the prison, so that crises such as the current mass escape can be avoided in the future.

The challenges for any Democratic candidate going in the 2026 race are formidable. The party has only won one statewide race in Alabama since 2008, and has not won the governor’s mansion since 1998. In the last 12 years, only one Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Walt Maddox in 2018, managed to get more than 40% of the vote.
Boyd said he is running for governor because he wants to give Alabamians an option to vote for a candidate that does not have ulterior motives.
“I would love to see a people type of campaign where there’s someone who’s really focused on the people of Alabama and not enriching themselves, or not just getting into an office and trying to entrench themselves to stay there. We need people who don’t care whether or not they’re voted out in the next cycle,” Boyd said. “They just want to do what’s right, and that’s what I’m all about.”
Boyd said his top three priorities as governor would be health care, economic development and community stability. Each priority expands and connects to issues he said he has seen in each county over the last decade.
“One of the things that I traditionally have done is, as soon as I reach a county, I talk about the top issues facing that county,” he said. “I immediately try to, in my speech, or in my time with people who are in the area, share what I believe could be a resolution to their problems.”
Boyd moved to Alabama around 2010 after growing up in South Carolina and living in Illinois. He got a B.S. in mechanical engineering from the University of South Carolina, an MBA at Regis University, a PhD in Religion from Christian Bible College, a PhD in Organization and Management from Capella University, and a Doctor of Psychology with a Christian worldview (PsyD) from St. James The Elder Theological  Seminary. He is also the pastor at St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church in Florence, Alabama.
According to campaign finance records, Boyd has not filed any fundraising dollars since establishing his campaign committee on May 27.
Currently, U.S. Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-Auburn) is the only other candidate in the race. According to campaign finance records, Tuberville has raised over $3 million.

(City of Ashland)A pair of Republican lawmakers has introduced legislation that would re-authorize the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Grant program, a popular program that allows the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to fund the purchase of public land and the upkeep of recreational areas. 
The decades-old program is set to expire next year and despite its bipartisan support among the state’s voters, a subset of Republicans in the Legislature — largely from the northern part of the state — have become increasingly opposed to the program due to concerns that it stops land from being developed for commercial activities. 
Until a 6-1 decision by the Wisconsin Supreme Court last summer, members of the Legislature’s powerful Joint Finance Committee had the ability to place anonymous holds on proposed grants through the program, which resulted in many projects being delayed or prevented altogether. Without that ability, Republicans who were already wary of the program became more opposed because of what they characterize as a lack of legislative oversight. Proponents of the program say the Legislature exercises oversight through the budget writing process when it allocates funding for the program. 
In recent years, the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship program has received $33 million annually in the state budget. In his budget request this year, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers proposed re-authorizing the program with a $100 million annual budget. Republicans stripped that provision out of the budget along with most of Evers’ other proposals. 
Last week, Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) introduced a bill that would keep the program alive with $28 million in annual funding. The bill would also create a major land acquisitions program for stewardship grant awards which would require the DNR to annually submit a list of all its proposed land acquisitions costing more than $1 million for that year. 
Those acquisitions would need to be approved by votes of the full Legislature. 
Additionally, the bill would create a sub-program to use stewardship grant funds for habitat restoration projects, require the DNR to prioritize projects that develop already existing public lands over new land acquisition, require local governments to match 20% of the state funding, get rid of the current 10-acre minimum size requirement and limit the state’s contribution to 40% of the total cost if the sale of a piece of land is already closed when stewardship funds are applied for. 
In a co-sponsorship memo, Kurtz and Testin, who did not respond to requests for an interview about the bill, said the initial proposal is meant to be the start of negotiations, not the final version of the bill. 
“It’s important to note what we’re proposing is not an agreed upon deal,” the memo states. “It’s a first offer to provide a starting place for negotiations on this important program. It’s very likely the bill will continue to change during the legislative process, but it’s important to put something forward to allow feedback, have open-minded conversations and ultimately find a good place to ensure the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program’s legacy continues.” 
At a meeting with the Wisconsin chapter of the Audubon Society in April, Kurtz said the program was on “life support” and he was trying to save it from dying but any bill would need to put some oversight on the DNR in order to receive enough Republican support. 
The opposition to the stewardship program from a subset of the Republican caucus in both chambers means the bill might require Democratic votes to pass the Legislature and reach Evers’ desk. 
Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) has spent months pushing for the program’s reauthorization – often pointing to a stewardship grant project in her district that was subjected to an anonymous hold, the Cedar Gorge Clay Bluffs on Lake Michigan. She said the hold on that project angered a lot of her constituents of both parties. 
“That really got people upset,” she told the Wisconsin Examiner. “People would not at all want to see a reenactment in any fashion of that anonymous objection process.” 
Habush Sinykin said that she’s closely watching the bill to make sure it protects a program that enjoys wide support outside of the Capitol building and will stir up significant opposition if it’s allowed to die. 
“Once people understand that this program is at risk, they are coming forward to express their opposition to any permanent damage to the program,” she said. “And so what we are engaged in right now is this process to keep it going forward, and there is going to be ongoing negotiation, because the devil is in the details. We need to make sure that what is one step forward will not ultimately be two steps backward.” 
Charles Carlin, director of strategic initiatives for Gathering Waters, a non-profit aimed at land conservation across Wisconsin, said that Kurtz and Testin should be credited for working to get the conversation started and provisions in the bill like the habitat restoration program. But he added that there are still a lot of questions about how provisions such as the requirement for legislative approval will work. 
“I think part of what they are trying to balance here is a recognition that this is an incredibly popular program with voters, while trying to balance that against the fact that there are a handful of legislators who are deeply skeptical of the DNR and deeply skeptical of additional investments in conservation,” he said. “So I see that major land acquisitions component as a way for them to try and balance those competing interests. The way that that major land acquisitions program is currently described in the bill just leaves a lot of question marks.”  
The bill is set to receive a public hearing in the Assembly Committee on Forestry, Parks and Outdoor Recreation Wednesday at 11 a.m.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/KreherPark-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

NEZ PERCE RESERVATION, IDAHO – Long before the American government removed them both from their ancestral homelands, wolves and Native Americans coexisted side-by-side for centuries.

Those connections run deep for Shannon Wheeler, the chairman of the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee.
Wheeler remembers growing up as a boy, hearing elder members of the Nez Perce Tribe tell stories about wolves. 
One story involves a young boy talking with his grandfather.
“They were talking and the grandfather told him that each of us have a wolf inside of us.
We actually have two wolves inside of us. 
One’s a good wolf, and one’s a bad wolf.
And they’re constantly fighting one another. 
And the grandson asked him, ‘Well, Grandpa, which wolf wins?’ 
And he says, ‘Whichever one you feed the most will win,‘” Wheeler said.
The story of the two wolves is one that Wheeler carries with him to this day. 
“We’re able to utilize that lesson and our teachings to our younger ones coming up as we continue to try to grow our people and to fit into part of a world that is outside of who we are and outside of our culture and so we need those strengths,” Wheeler said. “We need to know that we’re feeding the good wolf inside of us so that we are that strong.”


In addition to the stories, some members of the Nez Perce Tribe develop even deeper spiritual connections with wolves.
“What I can tell you from my position as the Tribal chairman is the wolf has always played a significant part in who we are as people, based on even the names of our people,” Wheeler said. “Many of our people have gone out for wéyekins … A wéyekin is something where you go and fast and you get your animal spirit, and it’ll come to you. And sometimes it’s a himíin, it’s a wolf. Himíin is the name for us for wolf.”
Nearly 70 years after the U.S. government drove the wolf population to near extinction in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, that spiritual connection is what led tribal members to work to bring the himíin back to Idaho, Yellowstone National Park and the West. This is the story of how the Nez Perce pulled off a task no one else wanted – and why they’re still fighting for wolves today.

 An opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land 

For thousands of years the Nez Perce Tribe has lived, hunted, fished and traded in what are now parts of Idaho, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Wyoming.
Over time, members of the Nez Perce Tribe developed a deep connection to the land and animals, said Allen Pinkham, a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who was born in 1938.
“To us, we are given the opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land that we’re at right now, and then we’re supposed to take care of the land and all the species that we utilize because it’s a life source,” Pinkham said. “It’s an opportunity to believe and have faith in your Creator. That’s what we do, and we’re supposed to take care of everything else, because it provides and sustains life for ourselves.”
Today, the Nez Perce is a federally recognized tribe that has about 3,500 members and governs the Nez Perce Reservation that is located in north-central Idaho.

  In 1965, Nez Perce National Historical Park was created by an act of Congress, and what was known as Spalding Park became the headquarters and visitor center for Nez Perce National Historical Park. (Photo by John Elk/Getty Images)
The Tribe’s headquarters is located in the town of Lapwai, Idaho, and the reservation sits on a fraction of the Nez Perce’s ancestral territory. Lapwai is a working-class town nestled in a valley and the reservation is a mix of grassland, forested mountains and rural communities anchored by the Clearwater River.
An 1855 treaty between the Nez Perce Tribe and the U.S. government set aside about 7.5 million acres of land for the tribe.
But after gold was discovered on the reservation, additional treaties shrunk its size to less than a tenth of what it was. It’s now about 770,000 acres
 The Idaho Legislature wanted no part of the federal governments plan to reintroduce wolves to Idaho 

Thanks to bounties, trapping and widespread poisoning, by the 1930s the U.S. federal government all but killed off wolves that used to roam the U.S. Rocky Mountains from the Canadian border to Mexico.
But in the 1990s the U.S. government undertook one of the most controversial wildlife programs in history – capturing wild wolves in Canada and reintroducing them in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park.



On Jan. 14, 1995 – in the aftermath of a major snowstorm, Suzanne Asha Stone was part of a convoy of vehicles that made a white-knuckle drive across icy roads to release four wolves at Corn Creek at the edge of the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Central Idaho. At the time, Stone was an intern on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s wolf capture and reintroduction team.
Conditions were so sketchy that some members of the team unbuckled their seatbelts as they worried about plunging into the freezing Salmon River below, Stone said. 
“If you slid off the road into the river, you wouldn’t have had time to disconnect your seat belt,” Stone said. “It was kind of like the decision of what’s the worst that could happen, and preparing for that.”
Carter’s Hope: After U.S. government killed off Western wolves, a bold experiment brought them back

The wolves, which had been flown from Canada, were placed in kennels and driven in the back of U.S. Forest Service pickups to the Frank Church Wilderness. 
When they arrived at Corn Creek, the wolf team opened the kennel doors and immediately released the wolves into the wild.
Those first four wolves reintroduced in Idaho had only been running wild for three days when the Idaho Legislature nearly derailed the entire operation.
On Jan. 17, 1995, the Idaho Legislature rejected the Wolf Recovery and Management Plan developed by the Legislative Wolf Oversight Committee. 
The move blocked the state from leading wolf recovery in Idaho.
And it left the federal government without a local partner to monitor and oversee the first wolf population to call Idaho home in more than half of a century.
What happened next is a largely untold story of how the Nez Perce Tribe stepped in to save wolf reintroduction in Idaho.  
Even now, 30 years later, many people in Idaho don’t know the role the Tribe played.
 ‘A song for the wolves:‘ How the Nez Perce Tribe saved wolves in Idaho 

Even as the Idaho Legislature said no to wolves, the Nez Perce Tribe was demonstrating its connection to wolves and investment in wolf reintroduction. 
Just before wolves were reintroduced to Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in January 1995, the late Horace Axtell, who was the spiritual leader of the traditional Nez Perce Seven-Drum religion, and Tribal member Allen Pinkham traveled to Missoula, Montana.
Axtell and Pinkham came to offer blessings for the wolves that had been captured in Canada and were being kept in kennels at an airport hangar before their release. They met the wolves just before they were transported over the final leg of their journey for reintroduction.
During the ceremony, Axtell welcomed the wolves back home to Montana, Idaho and Yellowstone.
“And so he sang a song for the wolves,” Pinkham said. 
About that time, the late Nez Perce leader Levi Holt traveled to Boise to meet with policymakers, said his nephew, James Holt. 
Levi Holt delivered a speech at the Idaho State Capitol pushing to have the Nez Perce Tribe take responsibility for the new wolf program in Idaho, James Holt said.
“My uncle Levi, being very active at that time, made that impassioned speech before decision makers to actually push them to have the Tribe be the managing partner for that reintroduction effort,” James Holt said. 
It worked.

Because of the Tribe’s connection to wolves and history of coexistence, the Nez Perce Tribe was ready to take over wolf reintroduction and conservation after the Idaho Legislature said no.
“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was looking for a partner, and we became that partner,” said Aaron Miles Sr., who has worked as natural resources manager for the Nez Perce Tribe since 1999.
Miles was still finishing his forestry degree at University of Idaho when the Nez Perce took over the program in Idaho. He took pride in seeing the Tribe taking a lead role in protecting a species that had shared a homeland with his ancestors. 
But Miles also heard plenty of stereotypes and lots of misinformation about the Tribe – even among college students he was helping tutor.
“I’d hear all the chatter about, well, can the Tribe do this? How can they do that?” Miles said. “They’re all these questions, and sometimes it was racist. It wasn’t just the fact that they were asking an honest question. But it had to be like, ‘OK, these Indians, this or that,‘ and here I am helping some of these guys with their homework, and that really upset me.”
 Hiking and howling, the jaw-dropping work of monitoring Idaho’s new wolf population 

Biologist Marcie Carter is a member of the Nez Perce Tribe who served on the Tribe‘s wolf project starting in June 1997. 
Carter got her start while she was still a student at Lewis-Clark State College and helped put together the first wolf management plan.

“Our goal was to go into the field, find paired up wolves that potentially had pups, and document the reproduction of those wolves, and also count how many pups were out there,” Carter said.
“That summer I don’t even recall how many, we probably had maybe five or six pairs of wolves that had puppies that year,” Carter said. “So they started out very well.”
Carter and another biologist spent their summer hiking around Central Idaho in places like Stanley and the Bear Valley area near the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, looking for wolves. 
The wolves had been fitted with radio collars that allowed the wolf project team to track their location. 
Typically a pilot and another team member would fly overhead, locate the wolves from the air and then use a radio to relay the animals‘ location to the biologists on the ground.
At that point, the biologists would hike in and locate the wolves. 
“We worked 10 days in a row, and then we’d take four days off,” Carter said. “And we camped out, we backpacked and lived in a tent and slept on our Therm-A-Rest and ate packaged noodles. And every day for those 10 days, that’s what we were doing. We were up, out and looking for any type of sign of wolves.”
Although she grew up in Idaho and had spent time in the woods, Carter hadn’t really ventured into the wilderness until she joined the Nez Perce‘s wolf project team. 
Before setting out, she had to borrow a backpack, sleeping bag, tent and cook stove.
A typical assignment during her first summer in 1997 involved flying into Central Idaho’s remote Chamberlain Basin with a team of other biologists. 
Located within the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the Chamberlain Basin was the site where one of the first wolf packs in Idaho established territory following the reintroduction of wolves. That pack became known as the Chamberlain Basin Pack.
“That was basically our lives during that time,” Carter said. “It was just backpacking, walking, hiking, listening. It was a great time.”
The reason they spent so much time in wolf country is because that is the best way to get an idea of how the wolves are doing and what they are up to.
Carter and the team conducted howl surveys. With hands cupped over mouths, researchers threw their heads back and let out their best imitation wolf howls.
They hoped to get live wolves to howl in response, which helped them track the wolves’ location.

As the team hiked and drove across wolf country, they scoured the ground for wolf tracks and droppings that researchers call scat.
They analyzed data from wolves fitted with radio collars.
They documented the newborn pups.
And they counted the wolves that were killed.
Once a year the team packed all that data into a report documenting Idaho‘s wolf population. 
“It was all very positive and very, very jaw-dropping type work,” Carter said.
Although the wolf project started as a cool summer job for her, it became more than that. 
Carter soon began asking one of her grandfathers about wolves.

They talked about how himíin, the Nimíipuu language word for wolf, comes from the word for mouth. That’s because wolves talk to each other, Carter said, with their howls.
When older members of the Nez Perce Tribe began to find out about the wolf project, they asked Carter about her work and shared stories about the Tribe’s history.
When they talked about losing wolves from the landscape, sometimes the older Nez Perce members talked to Carter about other losses the Tribe experienced.
“It was a learning experience for me, not just in the field, but culturally,” Carter said. 
“It’s just that it goes back to the loss of the connection that all Tribal people went through, with being moved to the reservation, being forced to stop speaking our language,” Carter said.
“It did kind of raise that awareness – also for other Tribal people – that loss that we had experienced and continue to experience,” Carter said. “And then that reconnection – it happened with wolves. It’s happening with salmon. Maybe someday it’ll happen with grizzly bears.”
Over six years on the wolf project, Carter documented growth and stabilization in Idaho’s wolf population. 
And as she observed wolves in their natural habitat, Carter saw a very different side to the animals that people warned her about. 
“I saw these families of wolves taking care of each other and playing, and they are not this evil that people think,” Carter said.
 As the wolf population increased in Idaho, calls for change grew 

During Carter’s time monitoring wolves, the population increased significantly.
Compared to the original 15 wolves released in Idaho’s Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in 1995, the Nez Perce Tribe reported a minimum of 192 wolves in the central Idaho recovery area in the fall of 2000.


 

	
At the end of 2005 – a decade after wolves were reintroduced to Idaho – the Nez Perce team and Idaho Department of Fish and Game biologists had identified 59 resident wolf packs in Idaho.
Biologists observed a minimum of 370 wolves in 2005, and estimated the state’s wolf population to be 512 in 2005.
By 2005, wolf territory in Idaho stretched from near the Canadian border, south to Interstate 84 and east from the Oregon border to the Montana and Wyoming borders, the wolf team noted in its annual report. 
During 2005, Wildlife Services officials said 26 cattle, 218 sheep and nine dogs were reported as “confirmed” or “probable” wolf kills. 
As the number of wolves and wolf kills increased, so did the calls to remove the wolf from the Endangered Species List and turn management of wolves over to the states.
Under the Endangered Species Act, animals that are listed in danger of extinction are given protections – like the protection of critical habitat and prohibitions on hunting – and recovery plans. For species protected by the Endangered Species Act, the animals’ recovery and stabilization is the priority.  
Animal species that have been saved by Endangered Special Act protections include the bald eagle, the California condor, the whooping crane and grizzly bear, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Once species are removed from Endangered Species Act protections, regulations can be eased and states can approve hunting rules or other management and lethal population control methods. 
In January 2006, then-Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Interior transferring day-to-day management of wolves to the state of Idaho.
After about a decade, the Nez Perce Tribes’ role leading wolf recovery in Idaho had come to an end.
“I think we would have kept it, but the funding was going away, and so we did not have the money to keep a program going,” Carter said. “And so I think the only way was basically to hand it over to the state.”
 Removing wolves from protections under the Endangered Species Act 

By 2007, the state of Idaho was officially planning for its first wolf hunts since reintroduction in 1995. At that same time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife put forward plans to remove the gray wolf from the Endangered Species List. 
A series of legal battles ensued, where wolves were removed and then returned to the Endangered Species List.
In January 2009, Samuel N. Penney, the then-chairman of Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee, wrote a letter expressing the Tribe‘s full support for removing wolves from Endangered Species Act protections in Idaho, Montana, eastern Oregon, northern Utah and eastern Washington.

Penney told then-Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar that wolves met recovery goals for the Northern Rocky Mountain region in 2002. 
By 2008, Idaho’s wolf population was estimated at over 800 wolves in 88 packs, Penney wrote.
“The Tribe wants, and understands that citizens of United States also want, wolves to be conserved,” Penney wrote. “The Tribe is confident that you understand the importance we place on being able to make decisions locally about how to wisely manage this resource in combination with all our other wildlife resources.”
Ultimately, wolves were removed from Endangered Species Act protections in 2011 after Congress inserted language into the federal budget requiring the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove wolves in Idaho, Montana, eastern Washington, eastern Oregon and north-central Utah from the Endangered Species List.
By May 2011, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game had taken over management of wolves in Idaho, and put wolf hunting tags up for sale.
Then in 2021, the Idaho Legislature expanded wolf hunting and trapping by removing the limit on the number of wolf tags hunters can buy, allowing trapping on private land year round and allowing the state to enter into contracts with third parties to kill wolves.
The state of Idaho had officially set out to reduce the wolf population by killing the predators.
Now Marcie Carter and other wolf advocates worry the government is starting to go down the same road it did 100 years ago when wolves were eradicated from the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
“We did all this great work, and we spent hours and hours out in the woods and then to come to this point where they’re treated like vermin, it’s really disorienting,” Carter said. 
“It’s definitely being undone,” Carter added. “It’s been being undone since we stepped out. It’s very expensive to recover wolves and it’s not very expensive to take them off the landscape.” 
Journalists Clark Corbin and Heath Druzin reported and wrote Howl over the course of 14 months, trekking deep into the backcountry in some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 chasing the story of America’s wildest and most controversial wildlife comeback story – wolf reintroduction.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner) Republicans and Democrats on the Wisconsin Joint Finance Committee were divided Tuesday about the amount of money the state should invest in several state agencies including the Department of Workforce Development, the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection.
Republicans on the committee said they were making strategic and realistic investments in priority areas, while Democrats said Republicans’ investments wouldn’t make enough of an impact.
GOP rejects new protection for state Supreme Court 
The first divisive issue came up when the committee considered the budgets for Wisconsin’s courts. 
Democrats proposed that the state provide an additional $2 million and 8 new positions for the creation of an Office of the Marshals of the Supreme Court that would provide security for the Court. 
Rep. Tip McGuire (D-Kenosha) and Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) said the need for the office has increased recently due to the number of threats the judges and justices are facing.

“Given the role that they play in our judiciary in order to be impartial, we shouldn’t want them to be in danger or to fear for their safety or to have any outward pressures on them that would influence the case,” McGuire said. “I believe it’s important for the cause of justice. I believe it’s important for the cause of safety.”
Roys noted the inflammatory language that members of the Trump administration have used when talking about judges and justices, noting that Republicans have passed legislation before to help protect judges. She also noted that former Juneau County Circuit Court Judge John Roemer was targeted and murdered at his home in 2022. 
“It is really frightening… and the Supreme Court has made this request over numerous years because they understand better than any of us do what it’s like to try to serve the public in this critically important but increasingly dangerous role,” Roys said. “I am much less interested in putting people in prison after they have murdered a judge than I am in preventing our judges from being attacked or killed, so, this seems to me a tiny amount of money to do a really important task to protect the third branch of government and particularly our Supreme Court.” 
Republicans rejected Democrats’ motion. Committee co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) said at a press conference ahead of the meeting that the Wisconsin Capitol Police are tasked with protecting visitors, employees, legislators, the Court and anyone else in the building.
“They do a good job and continue to provide top-notch work here at the Capitol as part of security for everyone who works here,” Born said. 
The committee also voted 13-3 with Andraca joining Republicans to allocate an additional $10 million each year to counties for circuit court costs.
Meat inspection gets additional funding
The committee took action on portions of the budget for the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP), giving a boost to he agency’s Meat Inspection Program and Division of Animal Health. 
“The focus here is going to be on basically keeping our food safe and preventing the disease from spreading,” committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) said. 
The Meat Inspection Program got an additional $2.7 million and two additional positions under the proposal approved by the committee. The program works to ensure the safety and purity of meat products sold in Wisconsin, including by inspecting the livestock and poultry slaughtering and processing facilities that are not already inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
The Division of Animal Health would get three additional employees that would be funded with about $500,000. 
According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, Wisconsin has 233 official meat establishments and 70 custom meat establishments that require state inspection. 
Roys said the proposal “falls far short of what is needed,” noting that agriculture is a major economic driver in Wisconsin and the industry is under pressure due to actions being taken by the Trump administration. The USDA recently terminated its National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection, which had been in place since 1971, and the administration has considered ending most of its routine food safety inspections work. 
“That kind of uncertainty is exactly why we need to step up our work at the state level,” Roys said, adding that she hopes that Republicans “consider funding at the appropriate level what our farmers…deserve.”  
Marklein noted that the committee’s work on DATCP’s part of the budget is not completed yet. 
“This is a program that’s had a shortfall year over year,” Andraca said, adding that she hopes “members of this committee are vegetarians.” 
“If there’s one place that I wouldn’t cut, it would probably be in meat inspection. If we’re looking at places to take a little off the edge, food safety is not one of them, particularly in a time where we have avian flu and other diseases breaking out,” Andraca said.
Youth apprenticeship program gets boost
The committee also voted along party lines to invest additional funds in programs administered by the Department of Workforce Development, including $6 million in youth apprenticeship grants, $570,000 in early college credit program grants, $250,000 for the agency’s commercial driver training grant program and $250,000 for the workforce training grants. 
Democrats had suggested that the committee dedicate $11 million for the youth apprenticeship program, which provides an opportunity for juniors and seniors in high school to get hands-on experience in a field alongside classroom instruction, but Republicans rejected it opting to put a little more than half of that towards the program. 
Andraca said the program is important for allowing youth to “try out new skills and new jobs” and train to fill positions in  Wisconsin  and that the $6 million investment makes it seem like the program is “pretty much getting gutted.” The program has steadily grown annually over the last several years at an estimated rate of 16%, although, according to the LFB, the number of additional students each year has declined going from a high of 1,923 additional students in 2022-23, to 1,703 more in 2023-24, and 1,430 in 2024-25. 
Andraca noted that the program currently operates on a sum certain model, meaning that there is a specific amount of money available and the size of a grant could vary depending on participation and available funds. If there is continued growth of 16% then the grant sizes could shrink. A sum sufficient model (which Democrats wanted) would mean that the agency’s spending on the program isn’t capped by a specific dollar amount.
Sen. Romaine Quinn (R-Birchwood) noted that the grants for students would likely grow from an average of about $900 currently to about $1,000 under the Republican proposal. 
“This motion [is] at $6 million and $100 per award over the last budget, but we’re supposed to believe it’s gutting the program,” Quinn said. 
“Welcome to the People’s Republic of Madison where stuff like that happens a lot; $6 million in new money is a lot of money to most people but obviously the other side, it’s gutting the program,” Born said, responding to Quinn. “At some point when you’re building a budget, you have to figure out a way to afford it, be reasonable in your investments, so maybe that’s why we don’t view a $6 million investment as gutting because we’re trying to live within our means.” 
Funding to support new Wisconsin History Center
The committee approved $2.3 million to support the new Wisconsin History Center in downtown Madison for 2025-26 and $540,800 and six positions annually starting in 2026-27.
Construction on the museum, which will be operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society, started in April and  its opening is set for 2027. 
The  Historical Society had requested the one-time funding of $2.3 million in 2025-26 as well as ongoing funding of $1.7 million annually — more than double the amount the committee approved — starting in 2026-27 to help with operational costs, including security, janitorial and maintenance services. It said without ongoing funding from the state it wouldn’t be able to open and maintain the museum. It also said that it was not anticipating needing to request additional funding for the museum operations in future budget cycles if the request is funded. 
The committee also approved an additional $562,000 in one-time funding across the biennium for security and facilities improvements for the Historical Society’s facilities and collections and $157,000 to cover estimated future increases in services costs. But the committee decreased funding for the Historical Society by $214,000 for estimated fuel and utilities costs.
DOR budget moves resources to Alcohol Beverages Division 
A law, 2023 Wisconsin Act 73, overhauled alcohol regulation in Wisconsin and created a new Division of Alcohol Beverages under the Department of Regulation tasked with preventing violations of the new laws. Republicans on the committee approved a motion to recategorize nine general DOR positions and over $900,000 to the Division of Alcohol Beverages to help with enforcement. It also transferred an attorney to the division and added $456,000 in funding for two more positions in the Division of Alcohol Beverages.
Democrats said that Republicans on the committee were “nickel and diming” the Department of Revenue with its proposal given that it recategorizes already existing positions rather than creating new ones. 
“I do appreciate some of the efforts involved in this motion,” McGuire said, adding that he noticed there were 10 positions that were moved around.
“That seemed odd to me,” McGuire said. “Were their feet up on their desk? They weren’t collecting taxes… or what were they doing? We want to be able to give the Department of Revenue tools they need to succeed, and frankly, the tools they need to provide resources to the state to make sure that everyone’s on an even playing field so we can fund the priorities” of the state. 
The GOP proposal passed on a party-line vote.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)Offering prostate cancer screening to men who are uninsured or underinsured will save lives, legislators, doctors, advocates, and cancer survivors said at a news conference Tuesday. 
“Prostate cancer is one of the most curable cancers if it is detected early,” said Rep. Rodney Pierce (D-Halifax), the bill’s lead sponsor. But, too many North Carolinians are diagnosed too late. “This legislation is about saving lives, about a higher quality of life, and giving our fathers, uncles, brothers, nephews and sons the fighting chance they deserve,” he said. 
House bill 128 would appropriate $2 million to establish a prostate cancer screening program modeled after the state’s breast and cervical cancer screening program.
Money for prostate screening is not in the House or Senate budget proposals, but Pierce hopes it will be funded. 
Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the state, according to the UNC Men’s Health Program. 
The issue has gained increased attention in the last few weeks after former President Joe Biden was diagnosed with “a more aggressive form” of prostate cancer.
Men in North Carolina are diagnosed with prostate cancer at higher rates than men nationally, according to the National Cancer Institute, and North Carolina’s mortality rate is higher, at 20.2 per 100,000 men. 
Black men are more likely to develop prostate cancer and more likely to die from it, according to the American Cancer Society.

Legislators at the Tuesday news conference made direct appeals to Black men to be screened. A blood test is used to screen for and monitor prostate cancer. 
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said he’s tested twice a year because his father had prostate cancer. 
“It is a sneaky, nasty, tricky disease,” Jones said. “It’s ugly and it kills Black men at a higher rate.”
“It doesn’t give you a warning, it just comes on you,” Jones said. “I just encourage all my brothers out there to please get tested.” 
New Bern Alderman Victor Taylor, a prostate cancer survivor, said the screening bill would help men in rural areas. 
It’s vital for men to talk about prostate cancer, he said. 
‘It’s so important to talk, talk, talk and share,” he said. “You don’t know how many lives you’ve saved by talking and sharing.”
The bill proposes free or low-cost testing for uninsured or underinsured men ages 40 to 70 who have a family history of prostate cancer. Men without a family history would be eligible for screening at ages 50 to 70. 
Recommendations for screening have a cloudy history. 
In 2012, the US Preventative Service Task Force, a group of independent experts, recommended against routine screening. The recommendation changed in 2018, with the group suggesting men 55- to 69-years old talk with their doctors about regular screening. The task force is in the process of updating its recommendation. 
Dr. Dan George, a member of the Duke Cancer Institute who specializes in prostate cancers, said there’s a concern that prostate cancer is going under-treated. 
“It’s so vitally important for people to recognize that knowledge is power,” George said. “Understanding your cancer status is an opportunity for you to prevent a leading cause of death in this state.”
Rural residents would benefit from routine testing that residents with access to medical specialists can more easily obtain, he said. 
Former state Sen. Eddie Goodall, a Union County Republican, talked about his prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Goodall said he was diagnosed in 2005, just as his first term in the legislature was beginning. 
“I was excited about being a freshman senator and being able to change the world,” Goodall said. 
Instead, he received a diagnosis that he kept secret from his mother because he didn’t want her to worry about another son dying. Goodall said that five years before he was diagnosed, his brother died of cancer. 
Goodall said he talked and compared notes with another former senator who was diagnosed with prostate cancer at about the same time. 
Goodall decided against surgery. The cancer spread to his bones. Goodall said he started hormone therapy in 2018 and was told he had 18 months to two years to live.

(Getty Images)A state-by-state report shows Indiana child well-being has improved with its highest rankings in over a decade for both economic and education categories. But it remains in the bottom half for health and family and community — indicating progress and opportunities to do better for Hoosier children. 
The 2025 KIDS COUNT Data Book ranked Indiana 25th overall for child well-being, slightly improving from 27th in 2024. In 2022 and 2021, the state ranked 28th and 29th. 
The report is developed by the Annie E. Casey Foundation in partnership with organizations across the country, including the Indiana Youth Institute. It aims to evaluate where there is progress and what needs greater support among four domains: economics, education, health and family and community. It ranks the national and state data among 16 indicators which are combined under the four domains. 
This year, Indiana ranked 11th in both economic and education, an increase from 15th and 17th last year, respectively.
“This year’s KIDS COUNT rankings reflect encouraging momentum … demonstrating that investments in children and families make a meaningful impact,” said Tami Silverman, president and CEO of Indiana Youth Institute. “We know what kids need to grow up healthy and connected so they can thrive as adults: stable homes, strong schools, nutritious food, meaningful relationships, and opportunities to learn, play, and grow. Programs that meet these needs are smart investments, fostering long-term gains like workforce development and economic growth.”
Nationally, states showed the most improvement in family and community. However, education worsened across the board, with declines in student proficiency in math and reading. 
New Hampshire and Vermont were ranked among the best in overall child well-being, while New Mexico and Louisiana were ranked lowest. 
Economic
Indiana’s economic indicators showed slight increases and was better than the national data in all four categories. In 2023, the number of children in poverty — 239,000 or 15% — remained similar to prior data in 2019. 
Meanwhile, fewer teens were out of school or work, and more parents had secure employment in 2023. However, the percentage of children living in households burdened by high housing costs increased from 21% in 2019 to 23% in 2023. 
Education
Indiana data showed better performances in education than national averages, ranking 11th among other states. But individual indicators were worse compared to prior year data.
Eighth-grade math proficiency dropped, with 69% not being proficient compared to 63% in 2019. Similarly, 66% fourth graders were not proficient in reading, as compared to 63% in 2019.
The percentage of high school students not graduating on time improved slightly, similarly to national trends. 
Indiana also performed worse in the percentage of young children ages 3 and 4 not in school, 60% compared to 59% in prior data.
Health 
Indiana’s health rankings align with national trends in children and teens between 10 and 17 who are overweight or obese and low birth-weight babies.
The state is below average for children without health insurance showing 6% are without. Nationally 5% of children don’t have health insurance.
Indiana averaged 34 deaths for children and teens per 100,000, marking an increase compared to 29 deaths in prior data.
Family and community
Indiana remained near the bottom nationally in family and community ranking 31st — unchanged from last year. Although each indicator improved and is performing slightly better than national data. 
In 2023, the state was home to more than 1.59 million children under 18. Of  that, 33% are children in single-parent families and 7% of children live in high-poverty areas, which decreased from years before. Nationally, 34% of children are in single-parent families and 11% of children live in high poverty areas. 
“When Indiana’s kids and families thrive, our entire state moves forward,” Silverman said. “These rankings are a reminder that while we’re seeing real gains in key areas, we must continue to focus on what works—ensuring that every child and every family has the support they need to grow, contribute, and thrive.”

If we permit our public land to be sold to the highest bidder, we submit to Hamilton’s misguided notion that our country should belong to an aristocratic class instead of ""we the people,"" columnist Rod Miller writes.
The post Public land: Our great equalizer appeared first on WyoFile .","What to do with public land has been a conundrum for us since before the ink was dry on our Constitution. If you look at a map of the United States as it existed in 1787, you’ll see the 13 original states, but also a vast swath of land called the Northwest Territory that wasn’t included within any state’s border.

Opinion

A few years later, after the Louisiana Purchase, the United States doubled in size and pushed our nation’s border westward to the Mississippi River. Thus began the debate over how this land should be occupied.
Leading this debate were two of our founders, Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, who approached this question from different philosophical standpoints that frame the debate to this day.
Hamilton, a closet monarchist, wanted to impose the European model of land tenure on the newly acquired property of the United States. Under this system, new land would be given to wealthy elites to establish an American aristocracy. He argued that, as in Europe, this new land-owning aristocracy would provide built-in support for the government that made them rich through land.
Hamilton envisioned that the Earl of Ohio or the Baron of Louisiana would populate their fiefdoms with serfs who would break the soil, fill the land and share the products with their feudal lords. The lords would kick back some of the increase to the government (or the crown, if you prefer), and raise an army of serfs to defend the nation, if required.
The European model had functioned for centuries after the fall of Rome, and Hamilton believed it would work here as well. To him, as the nation expanded, so would the aristocratic class, thus providing the backbone of the new country.
Jefferson, an anti-Federalist rebel, was aghast at this idea. He had a bellyful of monarchs and aristocrats and posed another option. Jefferson’s ideal of the yeoman farmer would prevail, and the new nation would expand on the shoulders of the common American frontiersmen who would build the United States ever westward, farm by farm, town by town.
Hamilton’s thinking was old, Jefferson’s new. Hamilton was elitist and top-down. Jefferson was democratic and bottom-up. Those two schools of thought about land are with us today.
When the dust settled after Manifest Destiny, and the country stretched coast to coast, the government instituted various homestead acts to encourage population growth in the nation’s vast interior. We, in the American West, live in the world that Jefferson shaped.
But not every acre was settled by homesteaders and the towns that sprang up around them. There remain more than a million square miles of unsettled land that is still in the public’s hands, and it should remain that way. Every citizen shares ownership of this land. It is our American heritage, and a common touch point for us. We can all use it, because it is in OUR hands. This land equalizes us.
When we hear political forces clamor for the public’s land to be sold, we should remember the tension between the Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian models of land tenure. If we permit our public land heritage to be sold to the highest bidder, for whatever reason, we accept Hamilton’s misguided notion that our country should belong to an aristocratic class of oligarchs instead of “we the people.”
The choice is pretty stark. We can cash out our shared land holdings in order to fund federal profligacy by selling our public domain to wannabe earls and barons, and thus become a nation of strip malls and trophy ranches coast to coast. The question becomes, “What shall we do with our shared soil?” We can pave it over so that rich folks can get richer. That seems to be the direction our Wyoming congressional delegation is leaning and, for the life of me, I can’t figure out why — other than tossing a posthumous bone to Hamilton.
Or we can scratch and claw to preserve our public lands, and keep them out of the greedy hands of Wall Street elites. If we choose that course, we’ll be able to bequeath the legacy of democratically held land to our great-grandchildren from a generation that loves them and wants them to enjoy what is rightfully theirs. We will keep our shared soil fertile, to nourish the roots of the American middle class. We can pass along to them the gift that Thomas Jefferson gave us.

The Freedom Caucus' plan will devastate Wyoming's small towns, the soul of the state, former lawmaker Albert Sommers writes. 
The post Eliminating property taxes will set Wyoming back appeared first on WyoFile .","On June 3 in Gillette, the Joint Revenue Committee passed a motion, 11-3, to draft a bill to eliminate property taxes from the Wyoming Constitution. The motion was made by Natrona County Republican Sen. Bob Ide, who initially said he wanted to amend the U.S. Constitution before being corrected. 

Opinion

What are the consequences of such a motion? Where did property taxes come from?
Property taxes have funded local communities in America since before this nation existed. Some accounts trace the first property tax to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634.
Wyoming first approved a property tax as early as 1889, during its territorial days. The retail businessmen, ranchers and bankers who built this state understood that property taxes were necessary to provide the financial means to educate our citizenry and build thriving communities.
But Sen. Ide and other members of the Freedom Caucus don’t want the state constitution to hamstring their tax-slashing agenda — an agenda that ignores the needs of Wyoming communities.
Our founders expressly put property taxes in the constitution because they knew that legislators would be tempted to eliminate taxes to garner votes in elections. That didn’t stop Revenue co-chairman and Freedom Caucus member Rep. Tony Locke, R-Casper, from complaining he was tired of hearing that his proposed property tax revisions were unconstitutional — even though his revisions failed to meet the standards for treating taxpayers equally and fairly.
Maintaining the constitutional link between property taxes and public services is not only wise, but necessary. Property taxes are more stable and have been the bedrock for funding public services that benefit Wyoming citizens and communities.
The Freedom Caucus claims to be constitutionalists, but the truth is they routinely try to ignore or alter the constitution.
Throughout the meeting, their failure to grasp tax policy was also apparent. Ide suggested a “consumptive tax,” i.e., sales tax, could replace property taxes. Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, spoke eloquently about the dangers of eliminating property taxes and explained it would take an incredibly high sales tax to replace all property tax revenues, which include ad valorem taxes paid through the production of minerals. Rep. Liz Storer, D-Jackson, added numerical context: Property taxes contribute $2 billion per year for schools and local services. Wyoming would need to more than double its sales tax to compensate.
Shifting from property taxes to sales taxes would devastate rural Wyoming. Sales tax is concentrated in Wyoming’s bigger cities and tourist hubs like Teton County. Small towns and agricultural counties, with fewer buyers and consumers, will struggle to raise enough revenue to maintain basic services.
But struggling small towns likely aren’t a concern of the Freedom Caucus. The group’s former leader, Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, once questioned on the floor of the Wyoming House of Representatives whether some small towns should still exist, implying they cost the state and taxpayers too much money. Do we really want to lose small-town Wyoming, the soul of our state?
Two days after their committee actions, and after their plans were publicized in a WyoFile article, the Freedom Caucus chairman of the Revenue Committee seemed to express buyer’s remorse in an interview with Cowboy State Daily. But they apparently missed the warnings clearly outlined during the meeting by several of their committee colleagues.
And this speaks to perhaps the greatest danger of the Freedom Caucus: its members’ lemming-like tendency to jump off a cliff when their leaders make a critical error, as seen in the 11-3 vote to eliminate property taxes. Imagine the collapse of local services and schools, with no real plan to replace the lost funding.
Electing people who will not think for themselves and are politically forced to follow some prescribed dogma or puppet master will ruin this state. We should resist the Freedom Caucus’s attempt to return Wyoming to the Stone Age.
Correction: This story has been updated to correct when Wyoming first instituted a property tax. —Ed.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, along with Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., signed three “Make America Health Again” waivers on Tuesday, allowing three more states to enact restrictions to SNAP benefits.
The move adds Idaho, Utah and Arkansas to the list of six states that have banned certain foods from being purchased with benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is the U.S.’s largest nutrition assistance program.
Idaho runs SNAP efficiently, officials say. But Congress might make state pay millions more.

In April, Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed into law House Bill 109, which required the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to seek federal approval to exclude candy and soda from foods eligible for coverage by the federal food program.  The bill, which goes into effect on July 1, passed the Idaho House on a 48-20 vote, after passing the Senate on a 25-10 vote with amendments.
“Idaho welcomes the MAHA movement. It is all about looking for creative ways to improve nutrition and increase exercise, the two main factors that influence overall health,” Little wrote in a prepared statement about signing the bill. “Secretary Kennedy said it so well: we need to take better care of ourselves and each other. He said it is an act of patriotism, and the future of our nation depends on it. Idaho couldn’t agree more.”
Under Idaho’s bill, soda includes nonalcoholic beverages with sweeteners, artificial or natural. But the bill doesn’t consider soda to be drinks with more than 50% juice, containing milk or milk substitutes, or that need preparation, such as powders or concentrates.
Pushback on Idaho’s bill during the legislative process largely focused on the bill’s broad candy definition, which critics say would also ban granola bars and power bars. The bill defines candy as “a preparation of sugar, honey, or other natural or artificial sweeteners combined with chocolate, fruit, nuts or other ingredients or flavorings” in several forms.
With federal approval secured, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare will begin implementation in January 2026, a Wednesday press release said. State officials will start meeting with retailers in the next 30 days, with a focus on retailer and customer education, according to the press release.
About 132,000 Idahoans are enrolled in SNAP, according to Idaho Department of Health and Welfare figures, receiving an average of $177 in monthly program benefits.
“Idaho is committed to improving the health of its citizens, and this waiver approval is a critical milestone,” Little said in a Wednesday press release. “With the backing of the Idaho Legislature and a very fast approval by the Trump administration, we’re taking a meaningful step forward in strengthening our efforts to improve the health of Idahoans.”

 How other U.S. states are approaching SNAP benefits

Utah’s waiver prohibits using SNAP benefits to purchase “soft drinks,” defined as “a nonalcoholic beverage that is made with carbonated water and that is flavored and sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners,” according to House Bill 403, the bill the Utah Legislature passed directing the state’s Department of Workforce Services to request the waiver. An earlier version of the bill would have also blocked candy purchases, but Utah lawmakers narrowed its scope before approving the bill.
Utah’s SNAP restrictions, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2026, don’t go as far as other states.
Arkansas’ waiver restricts SNAP participants from purchasing low- and no-calorie soda, fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice, and other “unhealthy drinks,” along with “confectionary products with flour and artificially sweetened candy, the Arkansas Advocate reported. Arkansas’ waiver will take effect July 1, 2026.
Rollins previously signed SNAP waivers for Nebraska, Iowa, and Indiana.
 U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the ‘MAHA’ movement

The latest round of SNAP restriction approvals come amid a national movement coined “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, that’s been  promoted by U.S. health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
In April, Kennedy stopped in Utah as part of his “MAHA tour.” During his visit he praised Utah’s SNAP ban, along with a slate of other “MAHA bills,” which was headlined by Utah’s first-in-the-nation law to ban cities from adding fluoride to drinking water.

“Thank you to the governors of Indiana, Arkansas, Idaho, Utah, Iowa, and Nebraska for their bold leadership and unwavering commitment to Make America Healthy Again,” Kennedy said in a news release issued Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “I call on every governor in the nation to submit a SNAP waiver to eliminate sugary drinks — taxpayer dollars should never bankroll products that fuel the chronic disease epidemic.”
Rollins, in a prepared statement, said the Trump administration is “unified in improving the health of our nation.”
“America’s governors have proudly answered the call to innovate by improving nutrition programs, ensuring better choices while respecting the generosity of the American taxpayer,” Rollins said. “Each waiver submitted by the states and signed is yet another step closer to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again.”

Critics of the SNAP restrictions, including Democrats and low-income advocates, argued states shouldn’t restrict freedom of choice and should treat Americans like adults who can practice personal responsibility.
Food industry representatives have also expressed concerns about unintended consequences by limiting consumer choices and creating confusion about what can or can’t be purchased in grocery stores. They also argued it isn’t likely to improve health outcomes.
But proponents from Republican-led states argued excluding “unhealthy” foods from SNAP benefits was “common sense.”
“This is about ensuring that public dollars are used to support public health,” said Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Director Alex Adams in a Wednesday press release. “By aligning SNAP benefits with nutritional goals, we’re not only promoting better outcomes for families today — we’re investing in a healthier, more resilient Idaho.”
The sponsor of Utah’s bill, Rep. Kristen Chevrier, R-Highland, called it a “no brainer” way to safeguard public health and stop “subsidizing poison for kids.”
In a post on X on Wednesday, Chevrier said Utah “led the charge” by seeking the SNAP waiver while also passing HB402, another bill that banned public schools from serving food with certain food dyes and other additives in them.
“I was honored to sponsor both bills,” she wrote. “This is the beginning of a critical and long-awaited cultural revolution.”
During debate over Utah’s bill, Rep. John Hawkins, R-Pleasant Grove, said he was initially hesitant to support the bill, saying he wasn’t a “huge proponent of the government stepping in and telling people what they can and can’t consume with their food.”
“But as I thought about it,” Hawkins said in February, “I’ve come to the conclusion that in this particular case, I think the government does have the right to say, ‘We want you to be healthy and we want to set the parameters around what you can use government subsidies for.’”

Such close proximity to […]","Anti-Line 5 graffiti at Enbridge’s pumping station in Mackinaw City, Mich. (Laina G. Stebbins | Michigan Advance)Canadian energy company Enbridge’s Line 5 traverses an extremely sensitive ecological area across northern Wisconsin, 400 rivers and streams as well as a myriad of wetlands, in addition to a path under the Mackinac Straights between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, all the while skirting the southern shore of Lake Superior. Such close proximity to the Great Lakes, lakes that hold over 20% of the world’s fresh surface water, lakes that supply drinking water to nearly 40 million people, yes, that does indeed make Line 5 a ticking time bomb.
Northern Wisconsin is also a very culturally sensitive area, home to the Bad River Reservation. The Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa were guaranteed rights to their lands by an 1854 treaty with the U.S. government. The easements for Line 5 across the reservation, granted to Enbridge by the Chippewa, expired in 2013 and the Bad River Band chose not to renew them. Enbridge continues to operate the line, illegally and in direct violation of the Bad River Band’s right to sovereignty over their land.
The Bad River Band has a guaranteed legal right to their land. They also have a right to Food Sovereignty, the internationally recognized right of food providers to have control over their land, seeds and water while rejecting the privatization of natural resources. Line 5 clearly impinges on the Band’s right to hunt, fish, harvest wild rice, to farm and have access to safe drinking water.
A federal court ruled that Enbridge has been trespassing on lands of the Bad River Band since 2013 and ordered the company to cease operations of Line 5 by June of 2026 (seems that immediate cessation would make more sense), but rather than shut down the aging line, Enbridge plans to build a diversion around the Bad River Reservation. They plan to move the pipeline out of the Bad River Band’s front yard into their back yard, leaving 100% of the threats to people and the environment in place.
Liquid petroleum (crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product) pipelines are big business in the U.S. With 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipelines, the U.S. network is the largest in the world. If we continue our heavy and growing dependence on liquid fossil fuels, we must realize that we will continue to negatively impact the climate and the lives of everyone on the planet. 
Instead of moving to a just transition away from fossil fuels, liquid or otherwise, the government continues to subsidize the industry through direct payments and tax breaks, refusing to acknowledge the cost of pollution-related health problems and environmental damage, a cost which is of course, incalculable. 
There are nearly 20,000 miles of pipelines planned or currently under construction in the U.S., thus it would appear that government and private industry are in no hurry to break that addiction, much less make a just transition. While no previous administration was in any hurry to break with the fossil fuel industry, they at least gave the illusion of championing a transition to cleaner energy. 
The current administration is abundantly clear. Their strategy is having no strategy. They don’t like wind and solar and they plan to end any support for renewable energy. They don’t care if they upend global markets, banking, energy companies or certainly any efforts to help developing countries transition away from fossil fuels.
Pipelines are everywhere across the U.S., a spiderweb connecting wells, refineries, transportation and distribution centers. The vast majority of pipelines are buried and many, if not all, at some point cross streams, rivers, lakes and run over aquifers. Pipeline ruptures and other assorted failures will continue and spillage will find its way into the bodies of water they skirt around or pass under. It’s not a question if they will leak, but when.
Enbridge controls the largest network of petroleum pipelines in the Great Lakes states, and they are hardly immune to spills. Between 1999 and 2013 it was reported that Enbridge had over 1,000 spills dumping a reported 7.4 million gallons of oil.
In 2010  Enbridge’s Line 6B ruptured and contaminated the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history. Over 1.2 million gallons of oil were recovered from the river between 2010 and 2014. How much went downstream or was buried in sediment, we’ll never know.
In 2024 a fault in Enbridge Line 6 caused a spill of 70 thousand gallons near Cambridge Wisconsin. And Enbridge’s most infamous pipeline, the 71-year-old Line 5 from Superior Wisconsin to Sarnia Ontario, has had 29 spills in the last 50 years, loosing over 1 million gallons of oil.
Some consider Line 5 to be a “public good” because, as Enbridge argues, shutting the line down will shut down the U.S. economy and people will not be able to afford to heat their homes — claims they have never supported with any evidence. A public good is one that everyone can use, that everyone can benefit from. A public good is not, as Enbridge apparently believes, a mechanism for corporate profit.
Line 5 is a privately owned property, existing only to generate profits for Enbridge. If it were a public good, Enbridge would certainly be giving more attention to the rights of the Bad River Band, the well-being of all the people who depend on the clean waters of the Great Lakes and to protecting the sensitive environment of northern Wisconsin and Michigan. They are not. Their trespassing, their disregard for the environment, their continuing legal efforts to protect their bottom line above all else, only points to their self-serving avarice.
The Bad River Band wants Enbridge out, and in their eyes it is not a case of “not in my back yard” they do not want Line 5 in anyone’s back yard.

“We want to make sure voters understand that these mailings are not spam or scams — they are an important part of the federally mandated process to maintain an accurate and secure voter roll,” Saline County Clerk Doug Curtis said in a press release.
Election integrity has been at the forefront of recent meetings of the State Board of Election Commissioners and was the subject of at least one legislative hearing last year.
The Saline County mailings are being sent via a third-party vendor as part of routine voter registration list maintenance required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, according to the press release. The process is intended to remove duplicate registrations and ineligible voters from the voter roll.
Voters may receive either a yellow confirmation postcard or a green cancellation postcard, the press release said.
  This yellow voter confirmation card is one of two notices voters in Saline County will receive as the county clerk’s office works on a routine project to assure the accuracy of its voter roll. (From the Saline County clerk’s office)
Voters who didn’t vote in the most recent general election will receive the yellow notices, which means they will be moved from active to inactive voting status on the registration roster. Inactive status does not remove the person from the rolls, and they will still be eligible to vote without having to re-register, the press release said.
Voters who didn’t participate in the last two general elections will receive the green cancellation notices. Those voters’ status moves from inactive to removable, which means they are no longer registered and must register again to be able to vote.
“Voters who receive one of these postcards should follow the instructions and respond promptly to ensure their registration status is accurate,” Curtis said.
Voters with questions may contact the Saline County Clerk’s Office at (501) 303-5630.

Shown is the 2024 Walk for Life in Lincoln. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Last year, Nebraska voters approved putting a ban on abortions after the first trimester into the state constitution, with exceptions for the life of the mother, rape and incest, instead of adopting a competing proposal that would have left the decision between a woman and her “treating health care practitioner.”
It was a unique choice for Nebraska voters, as the only state where voters faced opposing abortion-related proposals in 2024. Nebraska joined two other states, Florida and South Dakota, in rejecting ballot initiatives seeking to expand abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that governed reproductive rights for nearly half a century.
But an anti-abortion group is trying to push harder with a new ballot initiative for 2026 seeking to ban abortion outright with no exceptions. Choose Life Now is trying again after failing to get enough signatures for a similar ballot initiative in 2024.  
Ballot initiative organizers seeking to amend the Nebraska Constitution must gather signatures from at least 10% of Nebraska voters. The signatures must include 5% of registered voters in at least 38 of the state’s 93 counties.
Back again
Choose Life Now filed its paperwork to collect a new round of signatures in January — the same month as the original Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973.
“We do not consider this a political issue but rather a human rights issue,” said David Zebolsky, co-chair of Choose Life Now. 
During its kick-off event, organizers called the ballot initiative a “spiritual battle” to stop the “culture of death” that comes with abortions. The group said it plans to gather signatures with help from churches around the state and other forms of outreach — including a table at the Nebraska State Fair.
“We know that with evangelization and education we will see increasing support,” Zebolsky said. “And with God, anything is possible.” 
The language in the proposed ballot initiative is fairly simple, by design. It says, “A preborn child is a person at every stage of development, beginning at fertilization. Wherever under Nebraska law the term ‘person’ is used or implied, it shall include such a child.” 
The initiative also crosses out the voter-adopted constitutional language limiting legal abortions to the first trimester. 
Zebolsky said the ballot language was crafted in a way that it “would integrate easily into the existing state constitution and legislative statutes and be strong to withstand future legal challenges.”
The Choose Life Now’s quest for a total ban on abortion in Nebraska echoes national Christian advocacy organizations and some Republican members of Congress advocating for a nationwide ban. 
GOP moderating on abortion?
President Donald Trump, on the campaign trail in 2024, vowed to veto any total federal abortion ban, though the Trump administration recently rescinded a Biden-era policy that requires hospitals to provide emergency abortions to women whose health is in danger, including in states that restrict or ban abortion.
The national GOP has softened its stance on abortion since the Dobbs decision, as bans became unpopular with the public. On the state level, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said he would prefer a total abortion ban. 
Regardless, political optics don’t matter to those behind the latest ballot initiative, they say, because it is the “right thing” to do. 
“We’re called to do the right thing, in obedience to God,” said Teresa Fondren of Abolish Abortion Nebraska. “We can rely on his providential power to handle the results.” 
Familiar fight
Fondren, continuing a fight that nearly consumed two anti-abortion petition efforts in 2024, said the most significant opposition to the effort for a full abortion ban in Nebraska and in other states has been from “major” pro-life organizations. Advocates for a total ban have criticized Nebraska Right to Life and others for backing the initiative that restricted abortion instead of banning it.
During that 2024 campaign, Nebraska Right to Life and other advocates of putting some abortion restrictions into the constitution over the passage of a competing abortion-rights amendment argued that voters would not accept a total ban and some restrictions were better than none.
Abortion-rights advocates at the time argued that the restrictions amendment put women’s health and bodily autonomy at risk. They gathered signatures for a competing abortion-rights amendment that would’ve legalized abortion later into pregnancies.
Executive Director of Planned Parenthood North Central States Andi Curry Grubb told Omaha NBC affiliate WOWT that Choose Life Now’s renewed effort would fail again, because it does not reflect the values or will of Nebraskans.
“We know a majority of Nebraskans support access to abortion care and the right to make deeply private medical decisions about their bodies and futures,” Grubb said in a statement Wednesday.
Fundraising update
The constitutional amendment banning most abortions after the first trimester was backed by Nebraska Right to Life and Nebraska Family Alliance. Prominent anti-abortion politicians and conservative donors backed the Protect Women and Children campaign behind it, including the family of U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Tom and Shawn Peed, with Sandhills Global. 
Top donors for the failed abortion-rights amendment were former billionaire Michael Bloomberg and University of Nebraska Regent Barbara Weitz of Omaha. 
Typically, over the past decade, a successful petition effort in Nebraska could cost $1.5 million or more to gather signatures and campaign. 
Roughly a year ago, Rose Kohl, a Choose Life Now ballot sponsor, said the group’s effort in 2024 had “limited funding and virtually no paid circulators.”
The anti-abortion group increased its funding by $9,496 last month, according to the latest state campaign finance records. The Choose Life Now campaign now has $11,772 cash on hand. It raised roughly $13,738 for its 2024 effort. 
The group has until next July to gather enough signatures and meet other requirements to get on the November 2026 ballot. 
“It’s on us, the people of God of Nebraska, to rise up and put a stop to it,” Kohl said.

(Karen Kasmauski/Getty Images)June 10 marks one year since the U.S. Congress allowed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, to expire — abandoning thousands of Americans who sacrificed their health in the name of national security.
RECA provided critical compensation for medical expenses to uranium miners, mill workers, and “downwinders” exposed to radiation during Cold War-era nuclear testing and weapons development. But even when it was active, RECA was incomplete, excluding entire communities — including Idahoans — who suffered the same devastating consequences.
The unfinished legacy of RECA

	
From 1945 to 1992, the U.S. government detonated over a thousand nuclear weapons, scattering radioactive fallout across the West.
America’s nuclear ‘downwinders’ deserve justice

While RECA compensated some downwinders in Nevada, Utah, and Arizona, Idahoans — who endured the same invisible poison — were left out.
Uranium miners employed after 1971 and St. Louis communities used as dumping grounds for Manhattan Project Waste were also excluded from RECA compensation.
The consequences have been deadly. Research shows that radiation exposure leads to cancers, heart disease, genetic mutations, and immune disorders —with women and children at greatest risk. Yet for decades, the government dismissed these victims as collateral damage, treating rural Westerners and Indigenous communities as expendable.
 A ‘low-use segment’ of the population

Atomic Energy Commission documents revealed the attitude of the officials making decisions, that we were just a bunch of cowboys, Indians, and Mormons, and a “low-use segment” of the population.
Western states were deemed “low-population,” as if rural lives mattered less. The Marshall Islands, subjected to 67 nuclear tests, were treated as a sacrifice zone, and officials justified this; they are “more like us than the mice” is the quote from an Atomic Energy Commission official in 1956.
Dismissing Nevada Test Site downwinders and other nuclear weapons test victims as insignificant reflects a brutal truth: the U.S. government calculated whose life had worth and whose did not.
But cancer doesn’t discriminate. Families in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, and beyond have watched generations suffer from rare leukemias, thyroid diseases, brain cancers, and clusters of tumors. Many never knew their illnesses were tied to nuclear testing — until it was too late.
 Justice can’t wait

RECA should be reinstated and expanded to cover all radiation victims, including people like:

Idaho downwinders
Post-1971 uranium workers
Other communities excluded from fallout zones

Congress has a choice: pass RECA in the next must-pass Big, Beautiful, Bill, or continue to let victims die waiting. This isn’t just about compensation — it’s about admitting the full cost of America’s nuclear legacy and justice for victims.
 What you can do

Our representatives in Congress will make better decisions if they hear from residents about how expansion of RECA would affect them.
Research your family history — were there unexplained cancers, thyroid conditions, or stillbirths? Radiation’s effects linger for generations.
Speak up — this isn’t ancient history. Every day RECA lapses, more people suffer.
We can’t allow our government to wait for people to die.

This story was originally reported by Alexis Wray of The 19th.  Meet Alexis and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
 
From bohemian braids to feed-ins, Black people have always used braided hairstyles for protection, ease and versatility. These braided looks often include trendy and affordable synthetic hair. But though synthetic hair grants longer wear of the style and a maintained look, recent reports show it contains toxic chemicals linked to alarming health risks, including cancer.
Consumer Reports released a study in February examining 10 of the most popular synthetic hair brands known to have plastic fibers that create the Kanekalon synthetic braiding hair. The study detected high levels of lead, acetone and hazardous pesticides in most of the brands; all of the brands contained carcinogens, chemicals known to cause cancer.
Among Black women aged 18 to 34 nationwide, synthetic braids are one of the most popular hairstyles, according to Mintel, a market intelligence agency.
Ciara Imani May, like many people who regularly use the products, had long suspected something was off with synthetic hair. While she was teaching entrepreneurship at Johnson C. Smith University, a historically Black university in Charlotte, North Carolina, she became curious about the makeup of the hair. In 2019 she created a plant-based alternative braiding hair, after continually experiencing an itchy and irritated scalp when wearing braided styles.
“We are striving to have the most accessible plant-based alternative on the market, so that as people decide to ditch the itch, they have our product that they can make the switch to,” May said.
Just like May, several other Black entrepreneurs have started to launch alternative and plant-based braiding hair companies, including Nourie, Ruka and LAB Hair Without Harm.
While some plant-based braids are formed with corn-derived fibers, Rebundle is made of banana fibers. Rebundle hair is also skin-safe and biodegradable. May created the brand with the health of Black women, the primary users of synthetic hair, in mind. Before starting the company, she studied the correlation between scalp irritation and the use of synthetic braiding hair. Through her analysis in 2019, May found that many toxic chemicals and carcinogens are found in braiding hair and that the hair is causing some form of harm to people who wear it, and to the environment.
“I wasn’t surprised, just disappointed that it had taken this long for some research to come out, especially this type of research that garnered this much attention,” May said after seeing the Consumer Reports study.
Consumer Reports tested some of the brands that make up the $2.7 billion braiding hair market as of 2023, like Magic Fingers, Sassy Collection, Sensationnel and Shake-N-Go, revealing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in all synthetic hair tested. These types of braiding hair often cost $4 to $8 a pack and can be easily found at every beauty supply store. VOCs are often human-made chemicals used to make paints, pharmaceuticals and refrigerants that are emitted as gases.
According to the American Lung Association, breathing some VOCs can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, causing nausea. Long-term exposure can also cause central nervous system damage and has been linked to cancer.
VOCs can be highly toxic for braiders and Black women getting their hair braided, especially when the braiding process is complete. Braiders will then use a lighter or flat iron to remove stray hairs and finish the style by dipping the braids in boiling water. Consumer Reports found that heat treatments like this release VOCs. Some braiders have also said they experience contact dermatitis on their hands when working with synthetic braiding hair.
Because of the potential risk synthetic braiding hair poses to braiders and Black women, Rebundle launched a braiders network, where braiders are trained to use plant-based hair. The network provides samples of Rebundle, hosts marketing events and compiles a searchable database of trained Rebundle braiders.
Desiree Mills, a braider based in the Bronx, often uses Rebundle hair for her clients who have voiced that synthetic braiding hair makes their scalp feel itchy, irritated, tender or has even caused an allergic reaction.
“As Black women, we are taking the initiative to get more information about what we are applying to our crowns. I say crowns because our hair is like a flower; it needs water and hydration to grow and feel comfortable,” said Mills, who runs the salon AmourNtingz. The data from Consumer Reports, she said, “could encourage us to care more about our hair.”
Before Mills found Rebundle, she would soak and rinse synthetic hair in apple cider vinegar before braiding it into a client’s head as a way to detoxify and remove the chemical coatings and residues.
As a licensed braider for more than four years, Mills feels like the biggest difference between synthetic braiding hair and Rebundle is texture and appearance. To her, synthetic hair looks dead and feels rough, irritating, plasticky and waxy. She describes Rebundle as smooth on her hands with a natural shine of thick strands that smell fresh. The price is more expensive: Rebundle is $36 a pack compared to the typical $4 to $8 for synthetic hair. However, Mills said that the plant-based braiding hair can be stretched and separated with a technique that may require fewer packs of hair than a look that uses synthetic braiding hair.
“Anytime there’s an option, there’s room for change, there’s room to educate each other and educate ourselves with how we can be better or take care of our crowns better,” she said.
Similar to braiding hair, other beauty and personal care products marketed to Black women have been found to have toxic chemicals. Hair relaxers, a chemical used to straighten hair, also raised concerns for Black women due to its strong odor and the itchy feeling it gives the scalp. In 2012, a study revealed its toxicity and likelihood of causing various cancer diagnoses.
Black women largely switched from hair relaxers to natural styles because of the study. After the study gained national attention, salons and other professionals recorded declining sales of chemical hair relaxers over the last decade from close to $71 million in 2011 to $30 million in 2021, according to market research firm Kline + Company. May believes Black women can make a similar switch again for their health.
She describes this as a pattern that continues to put Black women’s health at risk, but she believes that being proactive and limiting exposure to toxins in beauty and personal care products is a great place to start.
“It’s the combination of all products that we use as Black women to beautify ourselves and to care for ourselves, we have to decrease all other risks as much as possible by just making more thoughtful choices,” May said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-1024x6831708602572-1.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Tennessee Republican lawmakers unveiled legislation this week that would make it a felony for public officials to release the names of immigration officers in yet another public swipe aimed at the Democratic mayor of Nashville.
The bill, filed by a half dozen lawmakers who comprise Tennessee’s GOP House and Senate leadership, would also subject state and local officials to ouster from office under the state’s moral turpitude laws for revealing the names of immigration agents or information “related to specific future immigration enforcement operational activities.”
The bill’s filing, announced in a news release, is the latest effort by Republicans in Tennessee and members of the Trump Administration to target Mayor Freddie O’Connell, who decried mass immigration sweeps on Nashville streets in early May.

“The people of Tennessee expect their elected leaders to protect law enforcement — not endanger them,” said Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson of Franklin, who is sponsoring the measure. 
“When a public official like Mayor O’Connell chooses political activism over public safety, especially by interfering with federal immigration enforcement, he has no business holding office in the state,” Johnson said. 
The bill, he said, “sends a message not only to Mayor O’Connell, but to any other blue-city mayor who may consider following his lead.” 
Republican leaders have focused on an executive order by the mayor requiring certain city employees to report any interaction with federal immigration officials to the mayor’s office. 
The order, originally issued by former Nashville Mayor David Briley in 2019, was revised by O’Connell to require reporting within 24 hours, instead of three days. 
The mayor’s office then began publicly posting notes of those reports in an online spreadsheet. 
‘There will be repercussions’ Homeland Security official targets Nashville mayor over immigration

The initial public posts identified three federal immigration officials by their full names and one by her first name. The posts were inadvertent and later removed, the mayor’s office said. 
Trump Administration officials highlighted the posts as an effort by O’Connell to disrupt immigration enforcement activities and “dox” immigration agents. White House “border czar” Tom Homan pledged to “flood the zone” with immigration enforcement activities in Nashville in response to the mayor’s public statements condemning immigration raids.
Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton publicly called on O’Connell to rescind the executive order.
Two Republican-led U.S. House panels — the House Judiciary and Homeland Security committees — also launched an inquiry into the response by Nashville’s mayor to federal immigration enforcement activities. 
Asked Tuesday to address O’Connell’s statement that the release of immigration agent names was inadvertent, Johnson noted the bill addresses both intentional and negligent actions, calling them “unacceptable and dangerous.”
House Speaker demands Nashville mayor ax order to report federal immigration interactions

“This bill ensures that such breaches are not tolerated,” Johnson said. “Regardless of the intention behind the release of the information, public officials have a duty to protect sensitive information. Any failure to do so puts both public safety and the lives of law enforcement officers and their families at risk.”
The bill makes clear that sharing information between local, state and federal agencies to support the enforcement of immigration laws remains “fully permitted,” he said. 
Johnson did not address a question about whether a mayor had a right or responsibility to ascertain whether immigration enforcement actions were taking place in his city.
O’Connell’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the bill filing Tuesday.
At the height of immigration sweeps, which took place in the heart of Nashville’s busy immigrant enclave in early May, O’Connell spoke out against the actions he said were conducted by “people who do not share our values of safety and community and have the authority to cause deep community harm.”

Patrick Morrisey, the state has spent more than $700,000 in emergency purchases in an effort to fix glaring issues in West Virginia’s foster care crisis.
The money was spent on out-of-state vendors to help with urgent needs that included licensing new foster families and delays in placing children in homes. The state— which is the fastest in the nation to remove children from homes — doesn’t have enough traditional foster homes, leading to some children being sent to out-of-state facilities or sleeping in hotels.
About half of the money was spent on a foster care “listening tour,” where Chicago-based Guidehouse advisory firm facilitated meetings around the state that brought together foster families, Child Protective Services workers, biological parents and more to air grievances and offer solutions for a laundry list of issues in the child welfare system. 
“Without immediate intervention, West Virginia risks further deterioration of its child welfare system, placing countless children at greater risk of harm. The crisis demands urgent attention from agencies and community stakeholders to ensure that every child in the state receives the protection and care they deserve,” the state Department of Human Services wrote in an emergency purchasing request earlier this year requesting $348,000 for the listening session facilitator. 
Emergency purchases permit state agencies to bypass the usual bidding process required in state government. DoHS said in its request that the traditional procurement process “would take too long and not align with the urgency required to address the crisis.” 
“The CPS crisis has escalated to a level that demands swift intervention,” the request continued. The listening tour wrapped up last month, and Guidehouse will produce a report this summer with its findings. 
Morrisey, through an executive order, is requiring his office to review any purchasing requests over $100,000 as he looks to reduce government spending and root out waste. 
Along with approving the funds for the listening tour, Morrisey also approved a $390,000 emergency purchase request in March from DoHS for a vendor “to provide solutions-driven approach” to improve the state’s foster care licensing and placement issue. 
“Governor Morrisey is committed to reforming the Child Welfare System and supports creative solutions to the many longstanding, inherited challenges,” Morrisey’s spokesperson told West Virginia Watch.  
The one-year contract was awarded to Change & Innovation Agency, according to DoHS. The agency is a Missouri-based consulting firm that specializes in child welfare, child care and more. 
The agency will be tasked with helping DoHS improve its process for licensing foster families as the state has a backlog of families who have applied to foster. They’ll also work on ensuring the state is in compliance with state and federal foster care guidelines. 
“DoHS looks forward to partnering with Change & Innovation Agency to address the time required to license new foster families, placement delays and administrative burdens while developing a sustainable framework for long-term system improvements,” said Angel Hightower, communications director for DoHS.
  Sen. Mike Stuart, R-Kanawha
During the recent legislative session, Sen. Mike Stuart, R-Kanawha, called for an outside agency to audit the state’s foster care system, which is serving more than 6,100 kids with an ongoing shortage of CPS workers, in-state homes and mental health services for children.  The state spent nearly $70 million last fiscal year to house foster children in out-of-state facilities because the state doesn’t have the capacity to keep children close to home. 
Stuart also wanted a group to make recommendations for how DoHS could improve its foster care system. 
DoHS Secretary Alex Mayer pushed back on Stuart’s legislation, saying that he wanted to assess the problems himself after taking on the role at the beginning of the year. He also vowed changes to the troubled system. 
  Alex J. Mayer, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services
Mayer attended the listening tour sessions, saying that it was imperative he hear from people around the state about their experiences with the child welfare system.
Stuart paused his bill mandating the outside audit, and DoHS requested the outside group to help with placements in March before the legislative session adjourned. 
“The emergency procurement differs significantly in scope and intent,” Hightower said. “While Sen. Stuart’s bill proposed an external audit and study of the child welfare system, the department’s request focused on streamlining and improving foster care licensing and placement.”
On Monday, Stuart said bringing in an outside group to help with licensing foster families showed a serious approach under Morrisey in addressing the issues.
“I hope that my efforts have played a role in trying to fix a broken system. I applaud the governor’s office’s willingness to invest in our kids,” Stuart said. “I don’t care what form it comes in or who gets the credit, but I want to make sure and my focus is the child welfare system — making sure it works for our kids and our families.” 
He added, “I think there are a lot of people to blame here — administration after administration that didn’t pay proper attention to this issue.”
Stuart added that he expected more funding requests to address foster care problems. Lawmakers recently allocated more than $300 million in the upcoming budget for child welfare services; Morrisey cut 75% of lawmakers’ allocated funding to West Virginia’s Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, a program that helps foster children in the court system, before signing the budget bill. 
Morrisey recently announced sweeping reforms to the state’s child welfare system that he said would end “years of bureaucratic stonewalling” from within the agency and begin a “new era of transparency.” 
The Republican governor attributed some of the changes to the recently-concluded DoHS listening tour.

(Trumzz | Getty Images)In the heart of West Virginia’s rural landscape, the promise of new job opportunities through online training is overshadowed by a glaring problem: a lack of reliable broadband access. For residents like Dee and Bobby, this digital divide isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a barrier to building better lives and a more prosperous future.
Dee, in Wyoming County, is trying to restart her life after battling addiction and losing custody of her children. Last month, she enrolled in an online training program that promised to prepare her for a remote customer service job. Such jobs could be a lifeline in rural counties like hers, where traditional employment is scarce.
But Dee immediately hit a roadblock. Her home internet failed to meet the minimum speed requirements for a remote interview, let alone sustained remote work. Her hopes faded because of infrastructure deficiencies outside her control. Despite her resolve, her ability to secure a sustainable livelihood and rebuild her family remains on hold.
Bobby, a resident of a remote holler in Putnam County, has a similar story. He enrolled in an Adult Collegiate Education program to become an HVAC technician, aiming to increase his earning potential. But when winter weather made it unsafe to drive out of the holler, he lacked the internet access needed to keep up with coursework. Like many in rural communities without broadband, Bobby isn’t being held back by a lack of ambition or ability, but by the absence of a basic prerequisite most Americans take for granted.
These stories aren’t isolated. They represent the daily struggles of the 25% of West Virginians who live without access to high-speed internet. Nationwide, the digital divide still affects more than 14 million people, mostly in rural and low-income areas. But the gap is particularly stubborn in West Virginia, where rugged terrain and sparse populations make traditional broadband expansion more expensive, and where broadband buildouts have too often stalled due to bureaucratic delays.
The situation is worsening. Communities can no longer count on promised funding from federal initiatives like the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) program to materialize on time or to support the most effective technologies. Meanwhile, deployment delays continue as providers and utilities argue over who will pay to replace aging poles. These fights have little to do with the lives at stake.
But this doesn’t have to be the end of the story.
In McKee, Kentucky, a town tucked into the Appalachian Mountains like many in West Virginia, a nonprofit called the People’s Rural Telephone Cooperative (PRTC) has shown what’s possible. With support from federal funds, local investment, and a clear community mandate, PRTC has built and maintained a fiber broadband network that now offers above-average speeds. The project connected residents not just to the internet, but to jobs. More than 600 work-from-home positions have been created in partnership with job-training nonprofits, and the region has seen its unemployment rate drop by an astonishing five percentage points.
This model works because it is rooted in local ownership and accountability. It treats broadband not as a speculative venture for private profit but as public infrastructure, no less vital than roads or electricity. It also aligns broadband access with workforce development from the start, ensuring people are trained for the very jobs that connectivity unlocks.
West Virginia can replicate this success. Local organizations must be empowered and funded to close broadband gaps, while aligning closely with job-training providers to meet community needs. Strategic investment in community-based broadband cooperatives, especially those leveraging fiber, can create jobs in installation, maintenance, and the digital economy.
Broadband access is not a luxury. It is the foundation for economic mobility in the 21st century. Without it, education, career advancement, health care and entrepreneurship are out of reach. And without those, rural residents remain locked in cycles of poverty and dependence, no matter how hard they work.
If we’re serious about creating real economic opportunity in West Virginia, we must stop waiting for ideal conditions and start investing in real solutions. That means prioritizing broadband expansion as a matter of economic justice. Until people like Dee and Bobby have a fair shot at success, none of us should be satisfied.

When transgender Americans experience discrimination — like being harassed or denied equal services and medical care — they’re more likely to have poor mental health, a new report shows. 
“Health and Wellbeing: Findings from the 2022 US Trans Survey,” released by the Advocates for Trans Equality Education Fund on Wednesday, includes insights from surveying 84,170 trans adults across the United States. 
The report doesn’t break down results by state, but the organization said that transgender Americans in all states and Washington D.C. participated in the survey in 2022. Questions covered general health and access to health care, transition related care, sexual and reproductive health, mental health, life satisfaction and happiness and substance use. 
  Ankit Rastogi, the director of research at Advocates for Trans Equality. (Screenshot)
Ankit Rastogi, the director of research at Advocates for Trans Equality, said during a Tuesday press conference that the organization conducts the survey because “the best way to learn about trans people is to ask trans people.” 
“We need social acceptance and family support and the ability to live our lives authentically in public safely,” Rastogi said. “These are all means to create better health and well-being among trans people.” 
Among other findings, the report shows: 

Trans people who have supportive family members reported lower rates of suicidality than those without support. Among those with no victimization, 31% reported considering  suicide in the past year, lower than the 50% for those who were verbally harassed, 53% for those who were denied equal treatment and 63% for those who were physically assaulted.
Older Americans surveyed reported better health than younger respondents with 78% of those 65 and older vs. 60% of 18-24-year-olds rating their health as good or better. 
About 84% wanted gender-affirming care and about 60% received it. 
Trust in health care providers was higher in 2022 than in 2015, when the organization last conducted the survey, with half of respondents saying all their providers knew they were transgender compared to 40% in 2015. Many health care providers were supportive of their trans patients. early 3 in 4 (73%) respondents who disclosed their transgender status to their provider reported they felt treated with respect by at least one provider — higher than the 62% in 2015. 
Despite greater trust in medical  providers, trans individuals still put off seeing a health care provider because they fear they’ll be disrespected. The survey shows this is true for 32% of trans men and 20% of trans women. 
The fear of mistreatment isn’t unwarranted. The survey shows 47% of gender non-conforming Americans had negative experiences with health care providers in the 12 months leading up to their survey. 

Olivia Hunt, the organization’s director of federal policy, said the survey results can offer policy makers and the general public a better understanding of what it means to be a transgender person in America.

“Over the past decade, the idea of trans people has become something that’s more and more prominent in the media and popular consciousness,” Hunt said during the Tuesday press conference. “But unfortunately, to most people, including those lawmakers and policymakers that I and my team meet with so often, trans people ourselves are just an abstract idea, an idea that’s based on stereotypes and assumptions and often incredibly inaccurate pop culture representations of trans people.” 
Involvement in advocacy, Hunt said, will help make “trans people real” rather than a composite of a stereotypical character.
And, she said, “having real, concrete and rigorous data about the realities of trans people’s day to day lives” helps to dispel misinformation. 
“Trans people live all around the country. We’re not just a community that exists in some sort of abstract ‘somewhere else.’ We’re in every state and territory, in towns and cities from coast to coast, and almost certainly in every single congressional district,” Hunt said. “That’s something that I think is still not really there in the public consciousness.”

Robin Webb had changed her party registration stating, in part, that she chose to leave the Democratic Party and become a registered Republican because, “First and foremost, I’m a mother, a rancher and a lawyer” and that her core values have not changed.
  Sen. Robin Webb (LRC Public Information)
I thought a lot about the core values of being an American while I was outside the United States. 
My great grandmother immigrated from Germany and my great grandfather from Austria, hence the reason for my trip. I wanted to get a feel for my ancestors who, as teenagers who did not speak a word of English, had the courage to leave everything and everyone they knew to come to the United States — land of the free, home of the brave — and build a life.
It was impossible to be in Munich, to tour the Dachau concentration camp with a history professor, and to walk the same streets where the Third Reich began and implemented its hate-filled, authoritarian rule, and not see some of the obvious, frightening parallels to what is happening today, this minute, in the United States.
Let me be clear, I am not someone who thinks our current president or anyone else is Hitler. All despots come to power and rule in their own unique ways. Hitler was Hitler, Stalin was Stalin, Mussolini was Mussolini, Russia’s Putin is Putin, Hungary’s Orban is Orban, and so forth.
But I was also in Budapest in August 2014, and I can tell you how hopeful the Hungarian people were that Prime Minister Viktor Orban would rule as a moderate. That is not what happened, and I would not travel to Hungary today. As NPR reports, Orban is “in his fourth consecutive term as prime minister. In that time, he and his allies have dismantled democratic checks and balances, taken control of the country’s media, civil society and universities, and consolidated power in himself and his Fidesz party.” 
Sound familiar?
President Donald Trump was inaugurated less than five months ago. He has spent that time using the power of the presidency to mostly ignore Congress and the courts; punish his perceived political enemies; sue powerful law firms; threaten our most revered universities; make us economically unstable with ill-advised, off-and-on tariffs; deport hundreds of prisoners to El Salvador without due process, and use Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to gut federal agencies with a metaphorical chainsaw. 
And this coming weekend, he is throwing himself a full-blown military parade in Washington, D.C., on the same day as his own birthday.
It is all shock and awe and chaos, all the time, including when he deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles after being informed by the governor and local officials that this would not only be unhelpful, but that it would inflame the situation. He sent the Guard anyway and followed that by sending 700 Marines.
Which brings me back to Kentucky. 
Imagine there being an incident here in the Bluegrass in which Gov. Beshear, the mayor, senators and/or representatives, and local law enforcement specifically told the president not to send the Guard or troops because doing so would inflame the situation, and him doing it anyway? 
Do states’ rights still exist in the Trump administration?
Everyone — and I mean everyone — is talking about fear, chaos, and how the GOP’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill will strip Medicaid coverage from the commonwealth’s most vulnerable and kids and how the president’s inconsistent tariff statements are going to kill the bourbon industry. 
Meanwhile, from the great big huge powerful GOP supermajority in our state legislature we have heard mostly crickets when what is called for are cicadas. 
  A monument at Dachau is inscribed with these words: “May the example of those who were exterminated here between 1933-1945 because they resisted Nazism help to unite the living for the defence of peace and freedom and in respect for their fellow men,” May 22, 2025. (Teri Carter)
Before I left for my trip overseas, I spent a lot of time talking to friends and neighbors about their fears — founded or unfounded — about traveling internationally right now. Some said they would take a burner phone so they wouldn’t have anything critical of the president on their phones for customs to see. Others were traveling but deleting social media apps from their phones. Some were canceling trips altogether out of fear of encountering ICE agents at passport control. I was advised to install a location app on my phone and connect it with my attorney and my adult kids so that they would always know where I was and, when returning, that I was safely through customs (I begrudgingly installed the app).
When I got home, I received an email from a fellow Anderson Countian asking if I felt safe traveling and wondering if they should cancel a trip to Europe to see their relatives (I urged them to go). Another said he and his wife had planned to go to Europe late summer with their kids but thought they should wait until next year “to see if things would be calmer by then.”
Does this sound like the land of the free?
Sen. Robin Webb has been in the legislature for almost 30 years. Her decision to switch parties from Democrat to Republican is shocking not because she changed parties but because she changed parties now. 
In her statement, Webb said she was first and foremost a mother, a rancher, and a lawyer. So let’s talk about that.
How does a mother look at today’s Republican Party? President Trump does not lead today’s Republican Party, he IS the Republican Party. Does a mother want this constant chaos, his hateful rhetoric online and on camera, his potential catastrophic damage to Medicaid (which provides health care to half of Kentucky’s kids)? Is that what a mother wants for Kentucky’s children, for the future?
How does a rancher look at the president’s inexplicable and waffling tariff policies and think, oh yes, this sounds like it will help businesses in Kentucky, sign me up.
How does a lawyer — someone who believes in the rule of law — look at the mass deportations of human beings without due process and the president suing law firms right and left because he does not like the clients they represent and say heck yes, this is why I became a lawyer.
If Sen. Webb wanted to change her registration to Independent, if she wanted to leave the Democratic Party because, as she said, the party left her, I would understand. I get that. I respect independence. I would simply wish her well.
What I can’t fathom is saying that as a mother, a rancher and a lawyer, she is purposefully joining Trump’s Republican Party in which abject, cult-like, subservient loyalty to one man — not the country, not the Constitution — is the No. 1 and only requirement.
Trump is not anyone but Trump, our own uniquely American Frankenstein built on this country’s obsession with celebrity, wealth, whiteness, and a sickening disdain for the poor. Trump is an American. Our American. We built him, and we will pay the hefty price for giving him power.
I returned to the United States from Austria and Germany with a pit in my gut for the parallels I witnessed between their history and our present, and I got here just in time to see German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sitting in the Oval Office with President Trump. When Merz brought up June 6 as D-Day, the president chuckled that it was “not a pleasant day” for Germany because they lost WWII.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)As we wrap up the school year and shift into the summer months, many of us are already planning for what’s ahead for next year.
We are kicking off our summer learning programs and starting preparations to ensure that the next school year starts strong. But the planning feels a bit different right now. Federal funding cuts proposed in Washington are causing uncertainty about what additional support schools may be able to provide families once the proposed cuts take effect in 2026.
One of the most pressing concerns is the impact on after-school programming. Congress is considering eliminating the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program — the only federal funding stream solely dedicated to after school and summer learning. Programs supported by these funds serve 1.4 million youth and 400,000 families across 10,000 communities.

The need for after-school and summer programs in Colorado is urgent and should not be considered political. For every child currently enrolled, five more are waiting for a spot. If funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers is eliminated, thousands of students and families in Denver could lose access to the safe, enriching and supportive programs they rely on every day.
These programs help students receive academic intervention, develop social-emotional skills and build confidence. For working parents, particularly in our most vulnerable communities, these programs are critical, and 77% of parents and caregivers said that without their after-school programs, they would have to cut back on work hours or even stop working.
Supporting after-school programming has been a consistent and valued part of the Denver Public Schools Foundation’s mission, and we believe that learning doesn’t stop when the school day ends. Through strategic partnerships with Denver Public Schools, local government and community donors, funding from the DPS Foundation provides safe, enriching and academically supportive after-school programs for more than 2,700 DPS students each year.
Compared to their peers not enrolled in such programs, students enrolled in regular DPS after-school programs exhibit better school attendance, lower suspension rates and higher academic growth across reading, writing and math. For example, national research shows that Colorado students in grades 4-8 participating in CCLC programs demonstrated a 60% growth on state reading and language arts assessments.
We’re committed to working alongside Denver Public Schools, city officials and our community to protect these vital programs. But philanthropy and local action alone cannot replace the scale of federal investment. Congress must understand what’s really at stake here. This isn’t about politics. It’s about families struggling to make ends meet while providing opportunities for their children to thrive.
Now is the time to invest, not divest, from what works. We don’t need more studies to demonstrate the positive impact of these programs. We know after-school and summer learning opportunities deliver real, measurable results for students and families.
The end of one school year should be a time of celebration and not uncertainty. Let’s make sure every student has what they need to succeed now and into the future.

(Map courtesy of Todd R. Lookingbill/Virginia Heat Watch study)As hot and humid summer weather settles across Virginia, a recent study finds that certain neighborhoods across the state, often with higher populations of people of color, can be up to 15 degrees hotter than other areas. The research cites extreme heat as the cause of “​​more fatalities in the United States than any other weather phenomenon.”
“There are differences in all of those municipalities in who is experiencing this heat, and usually it’s the neighborhoods that are least prepared to deal with it, have the poorest kind of infrastructure setup, such as air conditioning units and cooling centers,” said Dr. Todd Lookingbill, a professor of geology, environment and sustainability at the University of Richmond.
On a hot summer day in July 2021, over 200 volunteers with the study collected air temperature data in Arlington, Richmond, Lynchburg, Harrisonburg, Virginia Beach, Winchester, Farmville, Petersburg, Salem, and Abingdon. The areas of these towns that were the hottest had low tree cover and expansive concrete spaces that correlated with parts of town that had been historically underinvested, in part due to redlining practices. 
  These maps of afternoon temperatures in The Virginia localities in the study were “standardized to +/− 2 standard deviations from the mean temperature for each locality to allow visualization of intra-locality spatial patterning,” researchers wrote. (Todd R. Lookingbill/Virginia Heat Watch study)
In some of the cities that did not have large populations of people of color, other factors such as unemployment and education were common indicators in the areas that were found to be the hottest.
The Virginia Heat Watch initiative included researchers from 12 universities and colleges from all reaches of the state. The volunteers collected hundreds of thousands of temperature readings in one day. 
The study also found that the hot spot neighborhoods often have high populations of people with health vulnerabilities that make high heat a major risk factor. Exposure can lead to feedback loops of poor health and an inability to work.
“One of the things that’s really interesting in that regard is bus stops. In these kinds of areas, people tend to take more public transportation,” Lookingbill said. “We found that a lot of those bus stops are areas that are uncovered and don’t have a lot of tree cover or artificial bus stop cover.”
Some of the cities are taking proactive steps to make tree cover and other cooling techniques a priority in their city planning. Richmond has ideas for the expansion of green space and incentives for developers to keep or plant trees in the Richmond 300 master plan.
Research shows heat exposure disproportionately affects Black Richmonders

The Virginia Department of Forestry helped fund this study as part of their outreach to communities about their tree canopy mapping service. Communities can apply for grants to have the maps made, which will often line up with the hotspot data from the study.
“If we can get the word out that these programs exist, you know, local people who are aware of the issues that they face, they can reach out to us and have us come and assist. There are programs out there. We would just like people who need them to participate in them,” said Molly O’Liddy, Urban and Community Forestry Coordinator with the Virginia Department of Forestry.
O’Liddy said that the department is focused on not just urban areas in the largest cities. They also want to reach the smaller communities to show them where green space can help cool things down in parking lots, on sidewalks, or other areas of town.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)With six candidates on the ballot, the June 17 Democratic contest for lieutenant governor is the second most-crowded statewide primary in modern Virginia history.
If history is any guide, a congested primary can generate uncertainty and makes it possible that someone can claim the nomination with considerably less than a majority of votes cast.
Here’s a quick review of five statewide primaries since 1997 where the nominee won less than 40%. The races are listed in chronological order.
 1997 Attorney General (Republican primary)

Political newcomer Gil Davis made a splash by representing a former Arkansas state employee who filed a sexual harassment claim against then-President Bill Clinton. A week before the primary, state Sen. Ken Stolle released a TV ad attacking Davis, who was shown, drink in hand, talking to a client about her desire to pose naked in Playboy magazine. As it turned out, Stolle should have saved his fire for his Senate colleague, Mark Earley of Chesapeake. The party’s  ascendent anti-abortion base carried Earley to victory in a four-way race. Davis finished last.
Mark Earley 35.8%
Jerry Kilgore 24.6%
Ken Stolle 20.8%
Gilbert Davis 18.8%

In the 1997 general election, Republicans rode gubernatorial candidate Jim Gilmore’s “No Car Tax!” slogan to their first-ever trifecta of statewide offices. In the attorney general race, Earley captured 57.5% of the vote to defeat Democrat Bill Dolan. 
With a quiet second place finish in the GOP primary, Jerry Kilgore of Scott County in far Southwest Virginia put himself in line to become the party’s consensus attorney general choice in 2001. Gil Davis never ran for office again, but one of his law associates, Bill Stanley, won a special election to the state Senate in January 2011. 
 2001 Lieutenant Governor (Democrat primary)

In the second year after the millennium, the candidates with the best name ID were two members of the House of Delegates. Alan Diamonstein, at 69, was part of the party’s old guard that had just lost its majority in the House of Delegates. Jerrauld Jones was a skilled lawmaker who headed the Legislative Black Caucus. Richmond Mayor Tim Kaine, with his yard signs an unusual green and yellow, was only one year younger than Jones, but presented himself as a new generation of Democratic leadership. Kaine, the son-in-law of former Republican Gov. Linwood Holton, rang up big majorities in the Richmond area. 
Tim Kaine  39.7%
Alan Diamonstein 31.4%
Jerrauld Jones 28.9%

In the general election, Kaine landed just north of a majority (50.3%) in a three-way race against little-known Republican legislator Jay Katzen (48.1%) and Libertarian Party candidate Gary Reams (1.6%). Many Democrats had expected Charlottesville state Sen. Emily Couric to be their nominee. But Couric — a rising star who was as telegenic as her sister, Katie, the Today Show host — withdrew in July 2020 after a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Emily Couric died three weeks before Election Day. 
 2001 Attorney General (Democratic primary)

It’s hard to imagine a statewide Democratic primary where the populous suburbs of Northern Virginia do not play the kingmaker. But that is essentially what happened in June 2001, when Democrats went to the polls to select nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general. Without a single candidate from Northern Virginia, turnout was driven by candidates from Richmond and Tidewater. In the lieutenant governor’s race, twice as many votes were cast in Henrico County (7,528) than in Loudoun and Prince William combined (3,012). 
Downstate candidates — state Del. Whitt Clement of Danville and state Sen. John Edwards of Roanoke — put up dazzling favorite-son margins in their respective home bases, but the turnout worked to the advantage of Donald McEachin, a state legislator from Henrico who won majorities in core urban cities like Richmond, Hampton and Newport News. 
Donald McEachin 33.6%
John Edwards 29.5%
Whitt Clement 26.9%
Sylvia Clute 10.0%
Source: Virginia Department of Elections Database
In the general election, McEachin lost his bid to become the first Black attorney general in Virginia history. McEachin’s social justice agenda was ignored by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Warner, who ran a centrist campaign with crossover appeal to gun-loving, NASCAR-crazy rural Virginia. McEachin managed only 39.9% of the vote, falling below Mary Sue Terry’s previous record for the all-time worst performance by a Democrat in a statewide general election.
 2005 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary)

From the standpoint of geography and ideology, the four candidates who sought the lieutenant governor nomination in 2005 seemed handpicked to splinter the state’s Democratic coalition. Leslie Byrne and Chap Petersen were from Northern Virginia, Viola Baskerville was from Richmond and Philip Puckett was from Southwest Virginia. 
They ran the gamut from unabashed liberal (Byrne), diligent policy wonk (Baskerville), contrarian (Petersen) and conservative (Puckett). None were slouches; all were legislators who could point to achievements. In the end, party loyalists opted for Byrne, a familiar name who had served in both chambers of the state legislature and one term in the U.S. House, making her the first woman from Virginia to serve in Congress. 
Leslie Byrne 32.9%
Viola Baskerville 26.1%
Chap Petersen 21.7%
Philip Puckett 19.4%
Source: Virginia Department of Elections Database
In the general election, Republicans nominated state Sen. Bill Bolling of Hanover County and figured they would make quick work of Byrne, arguably the most left-leaning statewide Democrat nominated since populist Henry Howell in the 1970s. Even though Bolling held a 2-to-1 ratio fundraising advantage, Byrne made it a close race. The final tally was Bolling 50.1%, Byrne 49.3%.
 2021 Lieutenant Governor (Democratic primary)

This wide-open race with eight candidates — a record number for a statewide primary — narrowed in late April when then-Gov. Ralph Northam endorsed Hala Ayala. She was a little-known state legislator from Prince William County who had been swept into the House of Delegates as part of a massive anti-Trump backlash in 2017. Her story of financial struggle as a woman of color who lacked health care when her first child was born resonated with party faithful still celebrating Medicaid expansion in Virginia. Her multiethnic lineage (a father with Northern African roots who emigrated from El Salvador and a mother who was Irish and Lebanese) offered something for an increasingly diverse Virginia electorate.
Hala Ayala 37.6%
Sam Rasoul 24.3%

The general election was a historic one in which Virginia would elect its first female lieutenant governor – and the first woman of color. The GOP nominated Winsome Sears, a native of Jamaica who emigrated as a child to the United States with her family. Sears won 50.7% of the vote as part of a GOP sweep of the three statewide offices.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
For years, people in Grove City in Mercer County have fought to stop a decades-old landfill from resuming operations in their town. They were worried the landfill would make legacy pollution in the area worse.
But in 2022, information about the kind of waste the landfill would accept raised new fears.
“We realized we didn’t only have a trash problem, but we had a radiation problem,” said Beverly Graham, who lives about three miles from the landfill site and is the recording secretary for the Citizens’ Environmental Association of the Slippery Rock Area, or CEASRA, the local environmental group at the forefront of the battle against the landfill.
The group had found a map of landfills that accept oil and gas waste in Pennsylvania, published by investigative journalists at the Public Herald. One of the sites was Seneca Landfill, owned by the same company, Vogel Holding, that owns the landfill in Grove City.
“We just became very alarmed,” Graham said. Oil and gas waste—and especially the waste generated from fracking in Pennsylvania—is often toxic and radioactive. Researchers have found increased radioactivity downstream from the points where Pennsylvania landfills that accept this waste discharge their wastewater. Despite that, oil and gas waste is permitted for disposal in municipal landfills like the one proposed near Graham’s house.
“It’s in the middle of a population center,” Graham said of the Tri-County Landfill site. The landfill is close to a housing complex, the airport and an outlet mall. It’s only a few miles from Grove City’s Main Street.
The site also sits at the crossroads of two highways, making it ideal for trucking in waste from other places, and one reason, Graham said, that the company is so intent on re-opening there. “There’s no need for this landfill to open to take local garbage,” she said.
Oil and gas waste was a key focus in Commonwealth Court on May 6 as CEASRA and one of the townships where the landfill is located made their case for repealing the company’s solid waste permit.
Lisa Johnson, the attorney representing CEASRA and the township, told the judges what she and her clients view as the real impetus behind the landfill in a state where natural gas production has soared since fracking began.
“Pennsylvania has an oil and gas waste problem, and they need somewhere to put it,” she said. “There’s no need for this landfill [in the community]. And why would these environmental harms be inflicted upon the public if it’s not actually needed?”
  (Paul Horn/Inside Climate News)
Johnson said Pennsylvania’s environmental rights amendment, which guarantees the right to clean air and pure water, “demands that this permit be vacated.”
Alan Miller, representing the Tri-County Landfill, emphasized the legal definition of “hazardous.”
“I keep hearing ‘hazardous waste.’ Just look at our brief. There’s no evidence of hazardous waste having ever been disposed of in this landfill,” he said. “Oil and gas waste is not hazardous waste.”
The old landfill operated from 1950 until 1990, and modern laws governing “hazardous waste” did not exist for much of that time span. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act wasn’t passed until 1976; important amendments pertaining to hazardous waste disposal were added in 1984. And while oil and gas waste meets the dictionary definition of “hazardous,” it’s not classified that way under the law, the result of industry pressure.
In Johnson’s brief arguing against the landfill’s permit to discharge wastewater into a nearby watershed, she explained that the old, unlined site accepted toxic wastes like fly ash, foundry sands and 8,140 gallons of waste from General Electric, which included spent halogenated solvents.
The company and its attorney did not respond to requests for comment. In an interview with a local newspaper last year, the owner of the company, Ed Vogel, said “there’s always going to be a few people that are opposed” to the landfill.
“We really try to do the right thing. I have been doing this for years and I make sure we are always following the rules that are in place,” he said. He has also said the landfill would cut costs for the company and create new jobs in the community.
In 2013, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection denied an earlier application to re-open the landfill, citing “a history of non-compliance” at Vogel’s related waste companies, including Seneca Landfill. In 2023, the department reversed course. The company had hired new employees and improved enough that the “recent compliance history is on a par with or better than other comparable facilities operating within the Commonwealth,” the DEP said. There was “no reason” to deny the new application based on compliance history, according to the department.
But since that time, Seneca Landfill and related companies have been issued notices of violation, Johnson said. That includes four in March 2025, two of them for unlawful dumping and handling of solid waste “contrary to rules and regulations.”
In response to questions from Inside Climate News, DEP spokesperson Tom Decker said the agency was not concerned about increased radioactivity downstream of the landfill’s discharge point. “DEP does not believe there will be any environmental or health impacts” from the landfill’s treated wastewater, Decker said, pointing to the results of the agency’s 2016 study on radioactivity in oil and gas waste.
That study said there is “little potential for radiation exposure to workers and the public from landfills receiving waste” from the oil and gas industry, though it also identified “a potential long-term disposal issue” for TENORM, or Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material, the name for radioactive materials that have been concentrated or altered through human activity like drilling.
The study recommended that disposal protocols for this waste “should be reviewed to ensure the safety of long-term disposal of waste containing TENORM.” DEP did not respond to a question about whether it has started a safety review since the study was published.

The Tri-County Landfill has an approved radiation protection plan, which outlines rules for monitoring, exposure limits and recordkeeping related to radioactive waste. Its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit under the Clean Water Act requires the company to test for radium-226 and radium-228 quarterly. In an interview after the court appearance, Johnson pointed out that the permit does not set discharge limits for radium.
Initially, CEASRA’s Graham said, the group did not know the landfill would be taking oil and gas waste. When Tri-County’s permit included plans to accept “oil and gas and other oil drilling waste,” and they learned that Seneca also accepted this waste, the group became even more concerned about pollution affecting nearby homes and businesses.
The company has said that the Tri-County Landfill would operate similarly to Seneca and its discharge would be similar to that landfill’s. According to Seneca’s annual operations reports, the landfill detected radium-226 in TENORM waste brought to the site more than 60 times between 2021 and 2023. In each of those cases, the materials were disposed of on site.
The Black Run watershed, where the Tri-County Landfill’s discharge point is located, is classified as impaired. Decker said “the stringent permitting requirements and conditions imposed by DEP in the NPDES permit ensure that the discharge will not contribute to, or make worse, any impairment of the watershed.”
The dispute over the Tri-County Landfill reveals the paradox at the heart of laws that regulate pollution in the United States. As Pennsylvania’s Environmental Hearing Board explained in its dismissal of CEASRA’s earlier appeal of the NPDES permit, laws like the Clean Water Act do not ensure completely clean water or prohibit pollution; they only restrict its emission to certain levels.
“The law does not prohibit the addition of any pollutants to any stream,” the board wrote. Quoting a previous case, the panel noted: “The point of the environmental laws is not to prohibit the discharge of all pollutants, but to intelligently regulate such activity so that regulatory standards are met, environmental incursions are minimized, and any remaining harms are justified.”
These legal limitations are compounded when it comes to oil and gas waste, especially from fracking, which contains proprietary chemicals that companies are allowed to shield from public scrutiny for trade-secret reasons.
“The public isn’t aware enough about what is in this waste,” Johnson said.
Graham’s home is close to where wastewater piped into the Black Run will flow into Wolf Creek. According to resident comments submitted to DEP, these waterways are places where children play and people fish.
“Fracking is a process that ends with toxic waste, and we are not dealing with that,” Graham said. “And if you’re going to frack, then you need to take it all the way through to the safe disposal of the waste.”
If the appeal succeeds, it could have implications far beyond Grove City, for permitting and for other Pennsylvania communities where this waste is treated and disposed of.
“I think that this is an issue that communities and organizations aren’t going to let go of,” Johnson said. “The grassroots opposition to this waste being put in landfills—it’s bigger than just this case.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/0-2-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Since 2020, 36 states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery department. In rural counties, the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, less prenatal care and higher rates of babies being born too early. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images) Nine months after Monroe County Hospital in rural South Alabama closed its labor and delivery department in October 2023, Grove Hill Memorial Hospital in neighboring Clarke County also stopped delivering babies.
Both hospitals are located in an agricultural swath of the state that’s home to most of its poorest counties. Many residents of the region don’t even have a nearby emergency department.
Stacey Gilchrist is a nurse and administrator who’s spent her 40-year career in Thomasville, a small town about 20 minutes north of Grove Hill. Thomasville’s hospital shut down entirely last September over financial difficulties. Thomasville Regional hadn’t had a labor and delivery unit for years, but women in labor still showed up at its ER when they knew they wouldn’t make it to the nearest delivering hospital.
“We had several close calls where people could not make it even to Grove Hill when they were delivering there,” Gilchrist told Stateline shortly after the Thomasville hospital closed. She recalled how Thomasville nurses worked to save the lives of a mother and baby who’d delivered early in their ER, as staff waited for neonatal specialists to arrive by ambulance from a distant delivering hospital.
“It would give you chills to see what all they had to do. They had to get inventive,” she said, but the mother and baby survived.
Now many families must drive more than an hour to reach the nearest birthing hospital.
Nationwide, most rural hospitals no longer offer obstetric services. Since the end of 2020, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies, according to a new report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform, a national policy center focused on solving health care issues through overhauling insurance payments. Fewer than 1,000 rural hospitals nationwide still have labor and delivery services.
A small town tries to revive its hospital in the middle of a rural health crisis

Across the nation, two rural labor and delivery departments shut their doors every month on average, said Harold Miller, the center’s president and CEO.
“It’s the perfect storm,” Miller told Stateline. “The number of births are going down, everything is more expensive in rural areas, health insurance plans don’t cover the cost of births, and hospitals don’t have the resources to offset those losses because they’re losing money on other services, too.”
Staffing shortages, low Medicaid reimbursement payments and declining birth rates have contributed to the closures. Some states have responded by changing how Medicaid funds are spent, by allowing the opening of freestanding birth centers, or by encouraging urban-based obstetricians to open satellite clinics in rural areas.
Yet the losses continue. Thirty-six states have lost at least one rural labor and delivery unit since the end of 2020, according to the report. Sixteen have lost three or more. Indiana has lost 12, accounting for a third of its rural hospital labor and delivery units.
In rural counties the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated with increases in births in hospital emergency rooms, studies have found. The share of women without adequate prenatal care also increases in rural counties that lose hospital obstetric services.
And researchers have seen an increase in preterm births — when a baby is born three or more weeks early — following rural labor and delivery closures. Babies born too early have higher rates of death and disability.

Births are expensive
The decline in hospital-based maternity care has been decades in the making.
Traditionally, hospitals lose money on obstetrics. It costs more to maintain a labor and delivery department than a hospital gets paid by insurance to deliver a baby. This is especially true for rural hospitals, which see fewer births and therefore less revenue than urban areas.
“It is expensive and complicated for any hospital to have labor and delivery because it’s a 24/7 service,” said Miller.
A labor and delivery unit must always have certain staff available or on call, including a physician who can perform cesarean sections, nurses with obstetric training, and an anesthetist for C-sections and labor pain management.











You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services.


– Harold Miller, president and CEO of the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform



“There’s a minimum fixed cost you incur [as a hospital] to have all of that, regardless of how many births there are,” Miller said.
In most cases, insurers don’t pay hospitals to maintain that standby capacity; they’re paid per birth. Hospitals cover their losses on obstetrics with revenue they get from more lucrative services.
For a larger urban hospital with thousands of births a year, the fixed costs might be manageable. For smaller rural hospitals, they’re much harder to justify. Some have had to jettison their obstetric services just to keep the doors open.
“You can’t subsidize a losing service when you don’t have profit coming in from other services,” Miller said.
And staffing is a persistent problem.
Harrison County Hospital in Corydon, Indiana, a small town on the border with Kentucky, ended its obstetric services in March after hospital leaders said they were unable to recruit an obstetric provider. It was the only delivering hospital in the county, averaging about 400 births a year.
And most providers don’t want to remain on call 24/7, a particular problem in rural regions that might have just one or two physicians trained in obstetrics. In many rural areas, family physicians with obstetrical training fill the role of both obstetricians and general practitioners.
Ripple effects
Even before Harrison County Hospital suspended its obstetrical services, some patients were already driving more than 30 minutes for care, the Indiana Capital Chronicle reported. The closure means the drive could be 50 minutes to reach a hospital with a labor and delivery department, or to see providers for prenatal visits.
A fifth of Americans are on Medicaid. Some of them have no idea.

Longer drive times can be risky, resulting in more scheduled inductions and C-sections because families are scared to risk going into labor naturally and then facing a harrowing hourlong drive to the hospital.
Having fewer labor and delivery units could further burden ambulance services already stretched thin in rural areas.
And hospitals often serve as a hub for other maternity-related services that help keep mothers and babies healthy.
“Other things we’ve seen in rural counties that have hospital-based OB care is that you’re more likely to have other supportive things, like maternal mental health support, postpartum groups, lactation support, access to doula care and midwifery services,” said Katy Kozhimannil, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, whose research focuses in part on maternal health policy with a focus on rural communities.
State action
Medicaid, the state-federal public insurance for people with low incomes, pays for nearly half of all births in rural areas nationwide. And women who live in rural communities and small towns are more likely to be covered by Medicaid than women in metro areas.
Experts say one way to save rural labor and delivery in many places would be to bump up Medicaid payments.
As congressional Republicans debate President Donald Trump’s tax and spending plan, they’re considering which portions of Medicaid to slash to help pay for the bill’s tax cuts. Maternity services aren’t on the chopping block.
But if Congress reduces federal funding for some portions of Medicaid, states — and hospitals — will have to figure out how to offset that loss. The ripple effects could translate into less money for rural hospitals overall, meaning some may no longer be able to afford labor and delivery services.
Abortion-ban states pour millions into pregnancy centers with little medical care

“Cuts to Medicaid are going to be felt disproportionately in rural areas where Medicaid makes up a higher proportion of labor and delivery and for services in general,” Kozhimannil said. “It is a hugely important payer at rural hospitals, and for birth in particular.”
And though private insurers often pay more than Medicaid for birth services, Miller believes states shouldn’t let companies off the hook.
“The data shows that in many cases, commercial insurance plans operating in a state are not paying adequately for labor and delivery,” Miller said. “Hospitals will tell you it’s not just Medicaid; it’s also commercial insurance.”
He’d like to see state insurance regulators pressure private insurance to pay more. More than 40% of births in rural communities are covered by private insurance.
Yet there’s no one magic bullet that will fix every rural hospital’s bottom line, Miller said: “For every hospital I’ve talked to, it’s been a different set of circumstances.”

If North Carolinians lived in a perfect world, everyone would have easy access to plenty of healthy and affordable food, the self-control to resist junk food, and genes that would let them stay active, trim and fit throughout their lives.
Unfortunately, we don’t live in such a world.
And it’s in light of this that it was a no-brainer for state Health and Human Services officials to make prescriptions for weight-loss drugs a covered expense under the state Medicaid program.
As Jonathan Ray – a Charlotte physician assistant – wrote in a recent essay for NC Newsline, these medicines have helped thousands upon thousands of people to achieve significant weight loss, improve their metabolic health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.
Unfortunately, recent actions by state legislative leaders could end the funding for these essential medications.
The bottom line: In the imperfect world we inhabit, weight-loss drugs save health, lives and money. It would be cruel and foolish to end Medicaid coverage for these essential medicines.

As the Ohio Senate moves forward with its budget proposal, advocates for Medicaid are hoping changes can be made to avoid significant impacts to low income residents, elderly Ohioans, and people with disabilities.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Funding from Medicaid allows 3 million Ohioans access to health care services, including more than 770,000 who receive them through the Medicaid expansion program instituted in 2014.
That expansion program allows people who weren’t eligible for the traditional Medicaid programs but were still in categories of need to access health care. The existence of that program dropped the uninsured rate in Ohio to historic levels, according to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio.
Along with health care, Medicaid dollars help with services that aren’t necessarily connected to medical treatment, like home care, employment help, transportation, and a direct care provider who helps with all of those things.
“In many cases, if there wasn’t Medicaid dollars behind it, I know of many people whose ability to live outside of a hospital or in the community would be threatened,” said Jules Patalita, a disability rights advocate for Sylvania-based The Ability Center.
So advocates were disappointed to see the Ohio Senate maintain a provision from both the Ohio House’s and Gov. Mike DeWine’s budget proposals that would eliminate the Medicaid expansion group if the federal government reduces their level of support (currently at 90%) by even 1%.
“This would be a substantial loss for many working Ohioans,” said Kathryn Poe, researcher for the think tank Policy Matters Ohio.

Also included in the Senate’s budget proposal is the elimination of a Medicaid waiver that “would have provided continuous coverage for kids up to age 3,” Poe said, and a separate section of the budget that would “allow the state to pause, eliminate or change other funds related to all other federal grants, should Congress adjust or eliminate funding for that program.”
Poe did praise the Senate proposal for removing a House-submitted provision limiting Medicaid reimbursement for doulas to only six Ohio counties.
“This will ensure that Ohio parents continue to have access to culturally appropriate birthing resources and management,” Poe said.
Concerns about loss of access don’t just extend to physical health concerns or daily home services, but also to behavioral health services, on which 47% of Ohio adults on Medicaid rely, according to Kerstin Sjoberg, president and CEO of Disability Rights Ohio.
“If you don’t have access to some sort of insurance like Medicaid, it’s going to be almost impossible to get those services,” Sjoberg said.
The state-level discussions come as federal budget reconciliation also touches on Medicaid funding as the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress attempt to slash federal spending by $880 billion over the next decade, particularly from public assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid.
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and other leaders have talked about “abuse” or “fraud” as sources of revenue loss for the country in public programs, something those who engage with users of programs like Medicaid push back on.
“In reality, Medicaid is one of the most cost-effective and widely used safety nets in the country,” said the advocacy group Innovation Ohio in a call-to-action email over the congressional budget proposals. “If this bill becomes law, the result will be fewer people with health care, more families pushed into poverty and deeper inequality. Rural hospitals could shut down.”
According to a study by the Commonwealth Fund, Ohio could be one of the hardest hit economies if Medicaid cuts at the federal level come to fruition, cuts that could mean 29% more Medicaid spending by states or cuts to other programs, like education, to offset the Medicaid losses.
Direct care providers
One thing that will have to be addressed whether or not the cuts are realized in the state and federal budgets is the workforce that helps those who use Medicaid for home care and other services.
Patalita said the word “crisis” has been used in talking about the shortage of direct care providers, similar to the shortage of child care workers needed to provide adequate access to that service.
“We’ve talked to people who have had to wait weeks to be able to receive services in the home, because there just aren’t enough providers out there,” Patalita said.
The Ability Center did a study after the previous state budget increased the reimbursement rate for direct care providers under the state Medicaid program. That study showed that while reimbursements rates and, for that matter, provider wages should go up, the solution to the shortage problem wouldn’t come with just one answer.
“The direct care crisis is too complex of an issue for a single action to remedy,” The Ability Center found.
The study identified three “major elements” of the shortage: high turnover rates, low hourly wages (lower than “many entry level positions in retail and food service,” according to the study), and a lack of consistency in benefits.
“This failure by agencies to provide benefits adds to the worker shortage and forces those requiring home care to carry the burden of decreased access to care, especially those in rural areas,” the study found.
Eliminating Medicaid funding, including the expansion group, will make life harder for those Ohioans who need the services, Sjoberg said, “but it will also make it necessary that the direct care workforce is supported in other ways.”

(Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)The authors of a proposed constitutional amendment to protect Arkansas’ direct democracy process are still revising their measure following the attorney general’s rejection of their original draft last week.
Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said he could not certify The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment because it failed to meet the eighth-grade reading level standard set in a new law. 
Act 602, which became law in April, prohibits the certification of a proposed ballot title with a reading level above eighth grade as determined by the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula. The test uses word complexity and sentence lengths to calculate what grade of education is needed to comprehend written material.  
During a virtual press conference Tuesday, Jennifer Waymack Standerfer, a Northwest Arkansas lawyer and drafter of the measure, said it’s difficult to meet both the reading level provision and a requirement to not be misleading because the formula used to calculate the reading level assigns a higher grade to more complex words that she said are needed to properly convey the intent of the measure, such as “fundamental right.”
“If I say right instead of fundamental right, there’s a lot less syllables there and that drops my readability score, but I’m not being as transparent and open and honest with the public about what we’re actually doing,” Standerfer said. “The courts bounce around about rights and fundamental rights.” 
Sponsored by the Protect AR Rights coalition, the proposed measure would amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, the section that governs the state’s initiative and referendum process. It would designate as a “fundamental right” the right of voters to propose laws and constitutional amendments that can be put to a statewide vote.
Second Arkansas ballot measure rejected for failing to meet reading-level standard

Asked if breaking the proposal’s several sections into separate ballot measures would make it easier to meet the reading level standard, Emma Olson Sharkey, a partner at the Elias Law Group who specializes in voting rights and citizen-led ballot initiatives, said it’s not necessarily the amount of policies or changes that are involved.
“It is the way that they’re described, and even just that simple change (right vs. fundamental right), which would mean a lot to the people of Arkansas, wouldn’t meet the standard that the Legislature has set, which is, in my view, ridiculous,” Sharkey said. 
Among its various provisions, the measure would require petition signatures be gathered from at least 15 counties instead of 50 and would explicitly prohibit the Arkansas General Assembly from amending or repealing a constitutional amendment approved by voters.
Coalition members may consider removing some provisions and editing other language to meet the reading level requirement, Standerfer said. The drafting process has become a balancing act of meeting statutory requirements while also staying true to the intent of the measure, she said.
“All of the policies that we have in here are really, really crucial and really, really important, and if the Legislature is putting requirements on us that make us sacrifice content, then that is impeding upon the people’s rights to legislate,” Standerfer said. “They don’t get to tell the people what content they get to legislate in law.”
Legislative prerogative?
Various court interpretations of the Arkansas Constitution have said state lawmakers can amend an initiated act by a two-thirds majority vote, but not an amendment, Standerfer said. 
“That being said, the case that says that essentially says ‘well, we know what the Constitution says, but they couldn’t have possibly meant that, that’s crazy,’” Standerfer said. “There are some lawyers who are concerned the current Supreme Court would reverse itself, and because of that and the concerns that have been raised, additional clarity to restate the law as it exists now is warranted and appropriate.”
In an attorney general opinion issued in November, Griffin said the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1951 reasoned that the plain language of Amendment 7 gives the General Assembly the power to amend citizen-initiated constitutional amendments. But the court departed from the text because it didn’t believe it was voters’ intention to give lawmakers that power, he said. 
“In my opinion, that decision employed an erroneous form of reasoning and was wrongly decided,” Griffin wrote. “If this issue were raised today, I believe the Supreme Court would overturn that case and hold that the plain language controls.” 
During this year’s legislative session, lawmakers proposed a bill that would have granted this authority to the General Assembly, but it died in the House. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Two direct democracy proposals
Legislators were successful, however, in passing several laws changing the state’s initiative and referendum process, which prompted direct democracy-related ballot proposals from Protect AR Rights and the League of Women Voters of Arkansas. 
Direct democracy is the process through which Arkansans can propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The League’s measure was rejected three times, including once for failing to meet the eighth-grade reading level requirement. Griffin substituted and certified the popular name and ballot title so it met the reading level requirement on May 21. That means the League can begin gathering signatures to try to place their measure on the 2026 ballot. The nonpartisan group will officially launch its statewide signature collection campaign Friday in Fayetteville.
Court filings reveal opposition to intervening motion in Arkansas direct democracy lawsuit

The organization also filed a lawsuit in April that challenges several of the new direct democracy laws. Protect AR Rights filed a motion to intervene so the coalition can challenge additional laws not included in the original lawsuit, including the reading-level law. 
Both the League and the state argued in their responses to the motion that Protect AR Rights lacks standing and is not entitled to intervene in the case. 
In the meantime, drafters of Protect AR Rights’ ballot measure are continuing to solicit public input and hope to resubmit their revised proposal in the next week or so, Standerfer said. The attorney general’s office declined the coalition’s request for a meeting for feedback because of the pending litigation, she said. 
While the proposed ballot measures from Protect AR Rights and the League of Women Voters of Arkansas have the same general goal of preserving Arkansans’ rights to propose laws and constitutional amendments, they do conflict in some areas, Standerfer said. Because of that, if both qualify for the ballot and are approved by the voters, the one with the most votes would become law, according to the state Constitution, she said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-11 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT ranks 8th nationally in kids’ well-being in 2025,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/11/2025-kids-count-report-annie-e-casey-foundation/,CT earned high marks in education and health in the 2025 Kids Count but not in its economic well-being and family and community data.,"The results of the 2025 Kids Count report are in and Connecticut has maintained 8th place in the nation for the second year in a row.
The state earned high marks in two of the general areas analyzed in the report — education and health. But its economic well-being and family and community data pushed Connecticut’s overall ranking lower.
The annual report by the Baltimore-based nonprofit Annie E. Casey Foundation, which takes stock of childhood well-being, uses 16 data points to analyze how children fare in every U.S. state. 
This year, New Hampshire came in first and New Mexico last. Connecticut excelled in the Kids Count educational rankings, coming in third in the country after Massachusetts and New Jersey. Despite this, the report notes that scores eroded in three of that area’s four metrics.
Connecticut also received high marks for health compared to other states, ranking fifth nationwide. But Connecticut came in 26th in the country for economic well-being, and for family and community, it ranked 22nd.
In measurements that compare 2023 data with 2019 data, the number of children living in poverty — 95,000 in Connecticut as of 2023— improved slightly, dropping from 14% to 13%. And, the percentage of children whose parents lack secure employment also went down, from 27% to 23%. 
Meanwhile the percentage of teens who were not working or in school worsened, increasing from 6% to 7%, an issue that’s been highlighted by a recent report on ‘disconnected youth.’ In the area of health, the rate of child and teen deaths also worsened, from 25 per 100,000 in 2019 to 29 per 100,000 in 2023.
Despite Connecticut’s positive educational outlook overall, the report found the steepest declines in that area, with declines occurring in three of the four measured areas. There was a 5% drop in 3- and 4-year-olds who were enrolled in school, a drop of 7% in math proficiency among eighth graders and a 4% drop in fourth graders who are proficient in reading. But, given that national averages also declined in those areas in the same period, driven by losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, Connecticut hung onto a high ranking.
And Connecticut is likely to see major gains in the years ahead on at least one metric: the percentage of preschoolers. That’s because advocates, educators and lawmakers celebrated the final passage of a bill on Tuesday that intends to transform early childhood education by creating free infant and toddler care and free pre-K for scores of families, and will cap the cost of those supports at 7% of annual household income for families making more than $100,000.
“Connecticut is now a national leader in creating a child care system that truly supports working families and boosts our state’s economy,” said Eva Bermúdez Zimmerman, director of Child Care for CT, in a press release.
Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, said in a press release that Connecticut’s consistent top-10 ranking in the Kids Count is a testament to what’s possible when the state invests in kids and working families.
“But progress is fragile,” she said. “Federal proposals to slash funding for Medicaid, SNAP, and other vital programs could reverse hard-won gains. At the same time, housing costs are soaring and poverty is on the rise, especially for children. Connecticut must meet this moment with bold, equity-centered action.”
The advocacy group said it was calling on state leaders to address the economic inequality that threatens to undermine the state’s progress. 
The report found that nationally there were reductions in teen birth rates and in children living in high poverty areas that were echoed in Connecticut. But there were also broader losses in reading and math proficiency, lower preschool enrollment and a higher rate of babies born underweight.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0717_ChildCareStory-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Ford/Maryland Matters)Rhonda Pindell Charles and Jared Littmann cordially debated, and mostly agreed, Tuesday on how they would improve Annapolis if they were elected the next mayor of the capital city.
Both would form partnerships with community and nonprofit organizations. Both would work to eliminate environmental hazards in some of the city’s underserved communities. And both Democrats bestowed high praise on current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited from serving a third, four-year term.
“I think he’s one of the best mayors we’ve had … and I’ve been here my entire life,” said Pindell Charles, who has served as an alderwoman on the city council since 2009.
Littman, a former alderman who served five years on the council before his term ended in 2017, noted that he and Buckley have a number of similarities, including both having two children, but added that “my demeanor’s a bit different” than the outgoing Buckley’s personality.
Buckley was one of dozens on hand for Tuesday’s nearly 90-minute debate hosted by the Caucus of African American Leaders at the Wiley H. Bates Legacy Center.
Some sported blue Littmann T-shirts and others wore red or white shirts supporting Pindell Charles. There was at least one difference between the two besides their supporters’ T-shirts: Pindell Charles and Littman outlined different approaches to hiring city personnel.

“I have committed to keeping all staff. I have never heard any other mayor say that,” Pindell Charles said. “I’ve worked with these folks on a regular basis. I see how they operate [and] how they get things done.”
Although Littman commended city staff, he said he would interview each of the city’s directors and chiefs to assess their priorities, any expectations and how they would measure themselves against those expectations.
Anyone who may scores themselves a “10 out of 10 of everything always makes me skeptical,” he said. “I look for people who identify where there’s room for improvement.”
“I do not promise anybody a job. Everybody’s got to work for their job,” he said.
Littman has been working for the mayor’s job for 18 months already, declaring his candidacy in January 2024. Pindell Charles announced her candidacy in September.
As of Tuesday, they were the only two candidates seeking to be mayor, although others have until July 28 to file.
The Sept. 16 primary looms large in the city, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 2.5-to-1. The Anne Arundel County Board of Elections said that as of Tuesday, about 13,881 Democrats were registered in Annapolis, compared to 5,518 Republicans and 6,006. unaffiliated voters.
If no other candidates emerge, the primary winner could have a free pass to the mayor’s office.
Pindell Charles received a bachelor’s degree in business administration from Morgan State University, before earning a law degree from the University of Maryland School of Law.
The retired prosecutor, a native of the city she hopes to lead, seeks to make history as the city’s first elected Black mayor. Alderman John Thomas Chambers Jr. (R), who was Black, served on an interim basis for two months in 1981 after the suicide of Mayor Gustav Akerland (R).
Her time on council included a brief stint as acting mayor, when Buckley appointed her in 2o20 to serve while he traveled home to his native Australia to care for his ailing mother.

Littman received a bachelor’s degree in environmental engineering from Washington University in St. Louis and a law degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. He has worked as an associate county attorney in Montgomery County and is currently a small business owner with his wife, running K&B Ace Hardware in the city.
During Littman’s time on council, he sponsored several pieces of legislation that included a forest conservation law that’s a model for local and state leaders throughout Maryland.
On Tuesday, the candidates were asked about a dozen questions, including their plans to redevelop the City Dock, how they would account for financial gaps created by federal government cuts and ideas on how to improve public transportation in the next four years.
Philip Ateto, who lives in the city’s Ward 3, said after the debate he didn’t hear the candidates provide specifics on housing. In addition, he said they didn’t answer a question on how would they respond to a crisis like the current protests in Los Angeles.
“I was disappointed neither one of them really answered the question about what’s going on in L.A. and if it happened here,” Ateto said. “The community needs to know what we can expect from our law enforcement.”
Carl Snowden, convener of the Caucus of African American Leaders that hosted the debate, had a message for voters.
“Any citizen who has a candidate knocking on their door should ask one question: ‘If I elect you as a member of city council or mayor, how will the quality of life change for me and my family?’” Snowden said. “And if that person is not able to speak in specificity, then you be minded.”

The organization has become an authoritative voice on migrant issues and immigration legislation at the local, state and natioanl levels over the years. It did face controversy in November 2023, after some members issued statements and social media posts expressing  solidarity with Palestinians during the war in Gaza that began Oct. 7 of that year.

	It led somelawmakers, including Montgomery Count’s Senate delegation to publicly scrutinize CASA and threatened to pull public funding. Private donors also announced they would withdraw funding. CASA released a public apology from Torres in response.
The organization has been busy this year. Even before President Donald Trump’s (R) January swearing in, CASA held “Know Your Rights” events to prepare for  possible enforcement actions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
CASA leaders were in Annapolis lobbing for legislation, including one to prohibit local police from entering into 287(g) agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the 287(g) ban, the biggest loss for immigration. advocates this year.
CASA plans a nationwide search for someone to build on Torres’ “unshakeable legacy, carrying forward CASA’s mission to build people power, advance equity, and drive lasting systemic change,” said Melissa Guzman, the organization’s chief operating officer. “We invite visionary leaders from inside CASA and across the country to apply and help shape the next chapter of this movement.”
Torres will be honored at CASAs 40th anniversary celebration on Sept. 18.
Making the grade for the Chesapeake Bay
Unlike the typical student, the Chesapeake Bay has long received two report cards from two different schools: One from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, and another from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
But that could be changing.
At an event in Eastport on Tuesday to release the latest UMCES report card (which gave the bay a grade of “C”), officials from the center and the nonprofit said they’re looking to combine their efforts.
“We’re really excited about this, because it will reduce the confusion of having two separate report cards and slightly different messaging,” said Heath Kelsey, director of the Integration and Application Network at UMCES.

Bill Dennison, UMCES vice president of science application, said he approached the Bay Foundation decades ago about working together on a single report card, to no avail. “With the new leadership at the Bay Foundation, I think that dream could be realized,” Dennison said.
Hilary Harp Falk has been president and CEO of the foundation since 2022. She said Tuesday there’s lots left to iron out, but the potential partnership between the two organizations is exciting.
“We’ve been talking a lot about our shared goals and the strengths of the different products, and how we can both show how the bay is doing and answer that question, but also show a path to success, which I think has been elusive,” Harp Falk said. “We think the strength of our report card and our work and the UMCES science could really be a force multiplier.”
Dennison said looming cuts at federal environmental agencies have made the collaboration more urgent. On April 1, the center held a workshop with the Bay Foundation, as well as some riverkeeper groups that also have their own regional report cards, to discuss the future of bay report cards.
“This is a tough time for us environmentalists. The federal budgets are being slashed, and so we have to — more than ever — we have to work together,” Dennison said.
Life insurers seek rate hikes on long-term care
About 8,200 Maryland residents who use long-term care programs could soon pay more for services, as four life insurance companies are asking state officials to increase premium rates for those services.
During a virtual meeting with Maryland Insurance Administration officials Tuesday, representatives from life insurance companies argued that because people are living longer and more people are using long-term care services for longer periods of time, those rate increases are justified.
“Mutual of Omaha understands premium adjustments are never welcome news and we do not take such actions lightly,” said Rylan Deemer, product director and actuary at Mutual of Omaha. “Due to increasing use of long-term care services and longer open claims, we found it necessary to file this rate adjustment. In other words, more policyholders are recognizing the benefits of their long-term care insurance policies, using benefits more often and for longer than anticipated.”
Those justifications were shared by representatives from the other insurance companies Tuesday: – Metropolitan Life Insurance, Prudential Insurance Co. and Transamerica Life Insurance Co.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Requested rate increases range from 24% to 52%, depending on company and plan. The requests are not unusual for long-term care plans, but they come at a time when insurers are also looking to increase premiums on certain health care plans due to the possible loss of a federal subsidy under the Trump administration.
State regulations prohibit insurers from raising premiums more than 15% in a 12-month period, meaning that larger increase proposals would be spread out over the course of a couple years, if approved.
Each of the insurers Tuesday said they were sympathetic to policyholders who would not be able to afford long-term care plans at the higher rates, and said they would offer lower-priced, lower-coverage plans to those who could not afford to keep their current plans.
The rate increases are not finalized. MIA officials raised concerns that some of the rate requests could be too steep. The proposed rate increases are open to public comments until next week.
Help for Western Maryland flood victims
In the first use of a new state emergency fund, state officials announced Tuesday that they will award  $459,375 in financial assistanceto Allegany County to help victims of May 13 floods that swamped homes, schools and businesses and forced evacuations in Allegany and Garrett counties.
The funding is coming from the Maryland State Disaster Recovery Fund, a form of state-assisted financing for county and local governments “for the purpose of providing essential assistance to individuals, households, businesses, and local governments affected by disasters,” according to a news release from the governor’s office. Local governments can request aid from the fund, which is administered by the Maryland Department of Emergency Management.
“These funds will help Marylanders get back on their feet in the wake of historic flooding,” said Gov. Wes Moore in the release. “I encourage all affected Marylanders to learn if they’re eligible for additional resources and supports.”
Allegany County officials requested the funds after damage assessments showed recovery needs were beyond the county’s means, the governor’s office said. Heavy rains from May 12-14 led rivers and creeks in the region to flood, with Georges Creek reaching a near-record level of 12.41 feet. Rising waters forced evacuations in Garrett and Allegany counties, with the town of Westernport hit particularly hard. Floodwaters caused significant damage to more than 200 homes and businesses in the region.

“The comprehensive assistance — from multiple state departments — has been extraordinary, and this monetary award through the new Disaster Recovery Program is both timely and impactful,” Allegany County Commission President David J. Caporale said in the news release. “As the first recipients of this program, we recognize the significance of this moment, and we are committed to putting these resources to immediate use to help our neighbors and communities rebuild stronger than before.”
The Maryland Department of Emergency Management is also working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and state agencies in recovery efforts to mitigate the risk of flooding due to the impacts on the local rivers and streams in the area.
State officials estimate that volunteer organizations have provided more than $400,000 in support services, including muck-out and cleanup of residences and businesses across Allegany County. Area residents may also be eligible for disaster loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration Physical Loan program.

Democratic lawmakers have introduced a series of gun-related bills so far this General Assembly that have seen little, if any movement. The one bill that has had a hearing so far is a bipartisan bill.

“Republicans are focused on passing laws that they hope will distract you from their failures, while at the same time trying to divide us on common sense issues like gun reform,” Ohio House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, said Tuesday during a press conference. “Ohio Democrats will not stand idly by while Republicans in power refuse to do something about gun violence.”
Ohio had 571 gun-related deaths and over 1,700 incidents of gun violence in 2024, said state Rep. Darnell T. Brewer, D-Cleveland. 
Ohio ranks 21st in the nation for gun violence and gun deaths rose 42% in Ohio from 2013 to 2022, said state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati. 
More than 1,000 Ohioans aged 19 and younger died as a result of gun violence in the last decade, according to the Children’s Defense Fund. 
“When will enough be enough?” Thomas asked. “How many children have to die before you act? How many women have to be shot by their partners? How many funerals will it take before this legislation does its job? How many other officers have to be shot before we do something?”
Gun-related bills introduced so far by Democratic lawmakers include — 

House Bill 45 — Prohibit certain firearm transfers without a background check was introduced by Thomas and state Rep. Rachel Baker, D-Cincinnati, in February, but has had no committee hearings in the House Public Safety Committee. 
House Bill 46 — Enact the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act was introduced by Thomas and state Rep. Michele Grim, D-Toledo, in February, but it has had no hearings so far in the House Public Safety Committee. 
House Bill 120 — Exempt from sales and use tax sales of firearm safety devices was introduced by Brewer and state Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, in February and has had sponsor testimony in the Ohio House Ways and Means Committee. 
House Bill 235, Authorize tax credit for handgun training and firearms storage was introduced by Brewer and state Rep. Meredith R. Lawson-Rowe, D-Reynoldsburg, in April, but it has had no hearings so far in the House Ways and Means Committee. 

Brewer said he is introducing the community safety solution agenda which includes: 

A resolution to encourage responsible gun ownership by promoting safe storage practices to prevent children from accessing guns. 
A resolution on safe firearm storage education. 
The safe play act that would create a grant program through the state’s unclaimed funds to help communities build safe playgrounds. 
Close the boyfriend loophole act which prevents individuals convicted of dating violence or under protection order from possessing firearms. 
An act that would create comprehensive grants for cities that declare gun violence a public health crisis. 

“We do not seek to outlaw guns, rather, we want to offer common sense regulations and publicize safe responsible ownership of guns,” Lawson-Rowe said. 
This summer will mark six years since a mass shooting in Dayton killed nine people and more pro-gun laws have since taken effect in the state. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law in 2022 that got rid of all training, background check and permitting requirements to carry a concealed weapon. A 2021 law no longer requires people to retreat before they can justifiably hurt or kill someone with a gun in self-defense.  
“What we need now is the political will, something that unfortunately continues to be absent from the Republican-controlled legislature,” said state Rep. Michele Grim, D-Toledo. 
Russo said she wouldn’t be surprised if Ohioans try to pass a ballot initiative addressing gun violence and common sense reforms.
“I’m not aware of current efforts to do that, but you know, given how out of line this legislature is the public on this issue, and the lack of action on this issue, it wouldn’t be surprising to see that perhaps in the next couple of years,” she said. 
Ohioans did that in 2023 by voting to enshrine abortion and reproductive rights in the state’s constitution. 
“Gun violence has no place in our state and in our communities,” Russo said. “People deserve better. Our children deserve better.” 
State Rep. Karen Brownlee, D-Symmes Twp., shared stories of gun violence she heard from children when she worked as a mental health therapist. 
“A sibling group aged six to 13 running home from the bus stop to avoid a shooting in the middle of their residential neighborhood,” she said. “A six-year-old accidentally shooting his three-year-old brother to death with a gun left on the coffee table.” 
These kids would ask her how to stay safe around guns. 
“Sadly, the conversations ended with me explaining that Ohio laws protect guns more than they protect people,” Brownlee said. “… We are fighting against a powerful gun lobby which is more interested in sales than citizens.”
A new study from George Washington University showed more than 7,000 children died from firearm related injuries since the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that allowed states to set their own gun laws.

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., an Ohio Congresswoman wants to expand the definition of an “official act” to ensure corrupt politicians can’t wriggle out of accountability.
At the same time, state lawmakers in Ohio are mulling campaign finance changes that would allow corporations and unions to make unlimited contributions to dark money groups like the ones at the center of the HB 6 scandal.
Hearings begin
The HB 6 hearings bring together almost two dozen attorneys representing utilities, consumers, and several interested parties from the energy and manufacturing industry.
As part of the proceedings, each party gets a chance to cross examine witnesses. Several FirstEnergy officials who previously refused to testify citing their Fifth Amendment rights will take the stand in coming hearings.
State utility regulators preparing for Ohio House Bill 6 hearing

But after years in the works, the proceedings didn’t exactly burst out of the gate. Attorneys sparred before starting about what evidence was admissible and the correct order of cross examination.
Once the show got on the road, an auditor from Blue Ridge Consulting named Donna Mullinax took the stand to discuss a 2021 report on FirstEnergy’s capital recovery rider.
Utility companies in Ohio can get approval to state regulators to charge customers for investments in improving their infrastructure. The company recoups that investment by tacking a surcharge on consumers’ bills known as a rider.
The Blue Ridge audit dug into FirstEnergy’s books to determine whether the company’s expenditures were reasonable. Auditors determined that the company’s “revenue requirements calculation is not unreasonable,” but state regulators later asked for a closer look.
In that expanded scope audit, Blue Ridge found more than 20 payments to organizations related to former PUCO Chairman Sam Randazzo.
“I didn’t know who he was,” Mullinax told attorneys for the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel.
In all, the report indicated FirstEnergy funneled roughly $14.4 million to the Randazzo-connected entities, and many of those payments lacked supporting documents like a contract or purchase order.
DeWine says Randazzo’s ties to First Energy were well known, but the evidence of this is lacking

As part of a 2021 deferred prosecution agreement, FirstEnergy acknowledged paying a $4.3 million bribe to Randazzo, identified as “public official B,” for “performing official action in his capacity as PUCO Chairman to further FirstEnergy Corp.’s interests.”
This Friday, FirstEnergy’s former Senior Vice President, Dennis Chack will testify. He’s the first of six high ranking officials who used to worked at FirstEnergy who will take the stand. Chack previously pled the Fifth, but has been granted immunity from prosecution to share information relevant to the case.
Closing loopholes
Last week, U.S. Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-OH, joined six other lawmakers last week introducing what they’re calling their “End Corruption Now” agenda.
The proposals include a lifetime ban on members of congress lobbying and requiring members put investments in a blind trust, among others.
Sykes’ Closing Bribery Loopholes Act zeroes in on the definition of an “official act.” She pointed to charges against former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who accepted lavish gifts from a political donor.
A federal district court convicted him of wire fraud among other charges and the appeals court affirmed the ruling. But in 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his conviction.
“The court ruled that those favors did not meet the very narrow definition of an official act under federal law,” Sykes argued. “That decision blew a hole in anti-corruption safeguards and set precedent that made it easier for public officials to sell access, influence and prestige without facing any consequences.”
She explained the issue is important to her in light of Ohio’s recent history; Sykes was serving in the Ohio House at the time of HB 6’s passage and voted against the bill. She argued Ohio “had a lot of work to do” in the wake of the scandal that landed former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder behind bars.
Attorneys for Householder, Borges ‘hopeful’ following pardon for Cincinnati politician

“Unfortunately, that work has not started in the state house of Ohio,” Sykes argued, and so she’s attempting to address the problem at the national level.
Just two months ago, state lawmakers finally approved legislation eliminating the HB 6 rider propping up aging coal plants.
More recently, the Senate’s version of the state budget includes provisions allowing corporations and labor unions to make independent expenditures in political campaigns — like running ads for or against a given candidate.
Unlike donating directly to a candidate’s campaign, which is capped, independent expenditures have no upper limit.
With the Senate’s changes in place, the money FirstEnergy funneled to dark money groups controlled by Householder would be perfectly legal, so long as the expenditures were properly reported.
“Let me clear, when we allow public officials to use their power for personal gain and shield them from accountability, it undermines democracy itself,” Sykes insisted.
“This bill and the broader end corruption now agenda is about restoring public trust and ensuring that no one — no one — is above a law,” she said. “Not a governor, not a president, not a Speaker of the House.”

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal prosecutors on Monday detailed legal arguments for the detention until trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration.
Abrego Garcia was returned to Nashville from El Salvador on Friday to face two criminal human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
He appeared briefly in a downtown Nashville courtroom late Friday, and is scheduled to return to court this Friday for a formal arraignment of the charges against him.
That hearing will also consider a motion by the Justice Department to keep Abrego Garcia in custody until the date of his trial, which has not yet been set.
A federal grand jury indictment issued under seal May 21 and made public June 6 charges Abrego Garcia with “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Abrego Garcia “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens” for profit between 2016 and 2025 as a member of the MS-13 gang, prosecutors said.
Dumaka Shabazz, a federal public defender appointed to represent Garcia in the criminal case, declined comment on the charges Monday.
“At this date, we are not inclined to give a statement,” Shabazz said via email.
The criminal charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, court records show.
‘A stain on the Constitution’: Abrego Garcia lawyers refuse to drop his case against U.S.

Abrego Garcia was driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men when he was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville, court records said. He was not charged in the incident.
Prosecutors now allege that further investigation revealed the stop involved Abrego Garcia smuggling migrants within the United States illegally.
Abrego Garcia faces a potentially lengthy sentence: a maximum of 10 years in prison for each person he allegedly transported.
A resident of Maryland until a prior traffic stop on March 12 this year, Abrego Garcia was dispatched within days to an El Salvador prison along with scores of other detainees.
An immigrant from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia had received an immigration court order in 2019 that allowed him to reside in the United States and specifically barred the federal government from deporting him to El Salvador, where, he said, he feared gang violence.
The prosecutors’ memo seeking Abrego Garcia’s detention until trial, filed in federal court Monday, alleges there is a “serious risk” that Abrego Garcia “and/or persons acting on his behalf will obstruct justice and/or intimidate the witnesses against him” should he be released from federal custody pending his trial.
They also argued Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and a danger to the community.
In their memo, prosecutors said they plan to raise allegations that children without legal immigration status were transported and “used in unsafe ways” to avoid detection of Abrego Garcia’s illegal smuggling activities.
Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes involving the illegal transport of children.
Prosecutors also acknowledged that, should Abrego Garcia be released pending trial, he would likely be immediately taken into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to face further proceedings in immigration court.
Nevertheless, they argued that should he not be taken into ICE custody, Abrego Garcia would have an “enormous reason to flee.”
U.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes, who presided over Friday’s brief hearing, has given Abrego’s attorneys until Wednesday to file a legal response.

The photo on the right was manipulated, yet looks realistic, by reporter Morgan Trau for the sake of this news report.

“AI — every single day, (it) seems to be getting better and better,” state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, said.
And it’s becoming increasingly accessible. There are now widely accessible, free, or inexpensive services that use AI to create and edit photos, videos, and audio. But with that, Case Western Reserve University technology law professor Erman Ayday says come major problems.
“People can also use (sites) in order to create effects for themselves, like you can actually put yourself in front of a beach right now,” Ayday said. “But sometimes, they’re also used for manipulation, for bad purposes, for blackmailing.”
Over the past several years, deepfakes have become more prevalent online — with fake explicit photos of celebrities to politicians urging you not to vote for them.
Mathews is trying to stop this type of misinformation. He and state Rep. Ty Mathews, R-Findlay, have proposed Ohio House Bill 185, which would regulate AI content.
“This is a way for the normal Ohioans to protect themselves,” Adam Mathews said.
Malicious deepfakes, AI meant to harm someone’s image, would only be allowed as long as they have a clear watermark that they were artificially manipulated.
“If it would confuse a reasonable person, there is some type of disclaimer,” the lawmaker added. “If a reasonable person would say that this is a manipulated image, then that would not need a disclaimer.”
Let’s show some examples.

This is an expertly drawn “deepfake” we made of him. This one would not require a disclaimer.
“Political cartoons are totally protected; no one thinks that a drawing actually happened,” Mathews said.
Enforcement
The legislation would allow everyone to own their image, and it would be a trademark infringement to produce malicious content without someone’s consent. There could be civil penalties of tens of thousands of dollars.
The bill also makes it a third-degree felony to create or distribute malicious AI content in order to extort the individual being deepfaked.
Any pornographic deepfakes or deepfakes of a child are completely banned, with or without a disclaimer.
No one has spoken out publicly against the bill, but Ayday said the biggest challenge will be enforcement.
“This is not really something scary for people who are doing this for malicious purposes — especially during the elections or during some high-stakes events,” the professor said. “Distributing this thing in an anonymous way is extremely easy.”
The bill will continue being heard this week.

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
A new state law will require Ohio utilities and regulators to consider how technology might offer cost-effective options for improving the state’s aging electric grid.


Ohio’s grid, like those in many states, faces rising repair and maintenance costs, growing demand from data centers and other new customers, and increased risks as climate change fuels more frequent severe weather and outages. House Bill 15, signed last month by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, calls for a focus on software and hardware solutions to boost the safety, reliability, efficiency, and capacity of existing infrastructure.


Clean energy advocates are hopeful the investments will also allow the grid to accommodate more renewable energy and battery storage projects, which can suffer costs and delays related to transmission bottlenecks.


“This is a really, really great inclusion in the bill,” said Chris Tavenor, an attorney at the Ohio Environmental Council, an advocacy group.


Advanced transmission technologies that utilities must contemplate under HB 15 include things like sensors that allow lines to safely carry more electricity when conditions are favorable, a concept known as dynamic line rating. Digital controllers can remotely adjust the amount of power flowing through different parts of the grid, while topology optimization software can reroute power around congested areas, like a navigation app for electricity.


A key benefit of these technologies is that they can be used with existing infrastructure. When wires do need to be replaced, advanced conductors provide an energy-saving option. Those conductors use carbon composites or other materials to carry more electricity with less loss of that energy, compared to traditional wires of similar diameter.


A high-tech approach can create space on the grid for more renewable energy to come online. That would lessen the need to run expensive, polluting coal-fired power plants, said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney with the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a legal advocacy organization based in the Midwest.


Besides helping to mitigate climate change, less pollution would help people’s health as well, Tavenor said.


Under HB 15, owners of high-voltage power lines must file annual reports showing which advanced transmission technologies they considered as part of their five-year forecasts. Those companies will also need to identify areas of the grid with congestion, and compare the cost of addressing it with traditional versus advanced technologies.


The reports will be available to the public, and interested parties may ask the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to hold a hearing on whether utilities properly reported transmission information and whether they should be able to recover costs from customers.


The Ohio Power Siting Board must also require companies to consider technology solutions before it approves any new transmission projects. Companies would have to file reports and expert testimony to support any decision to forego advanced technologies in favor of conventional projects, Kelter said.

Advocacy groups and other stakeholders ​“would have a chance to similarly argue that those technologies are available and that they’re cost-effective, and that they would be able to alleviate congestion and delay the need for new transmission lines,” Kelter added.


The law requires the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to study the costs and benefits of the various technologies, including how to streamline their deployment. That report will be due by March 1 next year.


Some Ohio utilities have already been exploring the potential for advanced transmission technologies. In 2023, AES installed 42 dynamic-line-rating sensors at towers along five transmission lines owned by its Ohio and Indiana utilities. The companies shared early results last year showing that installing the sensors was cheaper and faster than replacing power lines, and using the sensors increased the system’s electricity-carrying capacity.


American Transmission Systems, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, is planning to spend nearly $900 million on dozens of transmission projects across Ohio in the coming years. ​“We are currently reviewing House Bill 15 and exploring how its provisions around advanced transmission technologies could be integrated into our planning to strengthen the power grid for Ohio customers,” said FirstEnergy spokesperson Lauren Siburkis.


Many of the law’s potential benefits hinge on how the Ohio Power Siting Board and Public Utilities Commission of Ohio implement its terms when making decisions on siting and electric rates, Tavenor noted.


The law’s advanced technology provisions only apply to high-voltage parts of the grid that move electricity over long distances. It doesn’t require utilities to consider high-tech approaches to improving the local distribution lines that deliver electricity to homes and businesses.


So, for example, AEP Ohio won’t need to consider advanced transmission technologies in its latest rate case filed on May 30, spokesperson Laura Arenschield said. That’s because AEP wants to use the 2.14% increase in base rates to pay for improvements to its local distribution system, not the AEP transmission network.


Similarly, the new law won’t address grid inequities affecting disadvantaged communities in FirstEnergy’s Ohio territory, which the Interstate Renewable Energy Council described in a report released earlier this year.


Even so, investments that use existing system capacity more effectively can still promote equity by reducing the need to build all-new transmission lines. Siting such infrastructure ​“can be incredibly invasive and inequitable, harming both communities and ecosystems,” said report author Shay Banton, who is a regulatory program engineer and energy justice policy advocate at the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.


Building less brand-new transmission can also save consumers money. Ohioans have generally paid for transmission maintenance and upgrades through a ​“rider” on their bills. For the average AEP Ohio consumer, that extra charge is roughly $40 per month. HB 15, however, aims to get rid of single-issue riders, so in the future, utilities will instead have to consider transmission costs through rate cases that consider all utility costs and expenses and are heavily scrutinized by regulators. That could also lead to lower costs or at least smaller increases.


“Ohio utility consumers already are burdened by billions in utility transmission projects,” said Maureen Willis, who represents the interests of Ohio’s utility customers in her role as the state’s consumers’ counsel. ​“By adopting advanced transmission technology, these costs can be reduced, staving off unnecessary ​‘gold-plating’ by utilities, giving consumers more bang for the buck. We strongly advocate for this approach to transmission spending.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)On an April afternoon in a small Midwest town, I stood on the side of a busy street with around 500 of my neighbors and community members to protest the current administration and to defend democracy.
I’m not going to lie. I was afraid. Even knowing we would be peacefully protesting in a public space where we are allowed by law to congregate and express our opinions, it felt dangerous. The reality of today is that people are being snatched off the streets and judges are being arrested. Plus, I live in a small blue dot in the middle of a large swath of red.
I deleted screen shots of funny memes and current facts from my phone. I wrote a phone number in sharpie on my upper arm in case I needed to contact someone with my one phone call. I researched Articles 90 and 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and printed out small messages to explain to any police or military presence that they will only be charged with disobeying any lawful orders and providing the GI Rights Hotline number in case of need. I disabled the location on my phone and logged out of all my social media. I made sure facial recognition and thumbprint were both turned off and couldn’t be used to open my phone against my will. I removed my dangly earrings and necklace. I took a deep breath and I walked out the door.
When I got to the city park, I found our allowed protest area neatly marked off with ribbon and volunteers writing signs on posterboard for those of us who forgot to bring a sign. I chose a sign that said “Freedom From Fear” and found a spot between the curb and sidewalk with my neighbors.
For the next two hours we held our signs high and waived at passing cars as they honked and cheered. It felt so empowering to be out in the world and with community members who feel the need to protect our democracy just like I do. I saw a professor I recognized from the nearby university. I saw knitting and crafting friends. I met new people. We were university students and working families and retirees and young parents with babies and toddlers.
Someone handed me an American flag to waive along with my “Freedom From Fear” sign. A veteran in a chair nearby along the line had a sign that read, “Hands off our democracy!” Several versions of “No Kings” or “America does not have a king!” showed up in the signs. So did “Resist Fascism,” “Hands off my books,” and, “No one voted for Elon Musk.” I chanted “Flush the orange turd!” along with the grade-school young ladies every time they walked up and down the line on the sidewalk with a parent and a homemade sign.
Every time someone chanted, “Show me what democracy looks like!” I shouted back, “This is what democracy looks like!” as loud as I could along with hundreds of neighbors and community members. Standing along that line I realized I am not alone. A whole lot of other people fear for our democracy and do not like the actions taken in our names. We are afraid and we are also willing to stand up for our democracy despite that fear. And I started to believe that most of us feel that way. None of us are in this alone.
Hundreds of cars drove by to cheer us on and honk. One drove by flipping us off. Another drove by shouting but no one could tell if they were shouting with us or against us. One large truck gunned the engine and spewed a black cloud along the street. But the rest? Hundreds and hundreds of people agreed with us. And the smiles of relief as they drove by were worth the fear. I was relieved too.
I recently heard U.S. Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Delaware, say that no one needs to be a hero as long as we all have a little courage, that seeing someone be courageous helps others have courage too. That day we had enough courage to walk out the door. I have faith that next time it will be easier. And next time? Next time I hope you’ll join us.

(Photo by WEWS.)In August 2023, Ohio voters sent a clear message when they overwhelmingly rejected the legislature’s blatant attempt to undermine our citizen-initiative process. But instead of listening, politicians in Columbus doubled down. Their new targets? Everyday Ohioans who dare to collect signatures, knock on doors, and exercise their constitutional right to direct democracy.
Ohio Senate Bill 153 and Ohio House Bill 233 are the latest attempts to dismantle the people’s power. While headlines may focus on disingenuous provisions about voter registration and drop boxes, buried deep in these 204-page monstrosities are provisions specifically designed to intimidate, harass, and shut down grassroots campaigns before they ever reach the ballot.
Let’s be clear: these bills are an attack on the People’s Process — on your voice, your rights, your power.
Imagine a system where simply collecting signatures for a cause you believe in could land you under investigation, compelled to testify before hostile politicians without any evidence of wrongdoing. No formal charges, no protections — just suspicion, interrogation, and intimidation. Organizers could be forced to reveal private donor lists, volunteer contacts, and internal communications. This isn’t democracy. It’s surveillance. It’s coercion. It’s guilty until proven innocent.
And it gets worse.
These bills are packed with petty, punitive rules designed to trip up campaigns on technicalities. Didn’t write the number of signatures in a petition book personally? All signatures in that book: void. A minor correction to a signature count? Void. Wearing a “compensation badge” while volunteering—because you accepted a slice of pizza before canvassing? If not, void. This is death by a thousand cuts — and it’s exactly what the General Assembly wants. Why? Because when citizens write the laws, it threatens the political status quo. A status quo built and reinforced by rampant gerrymandering that leaves most Ohioans without a voice in the Statehouse.  
Two constitutional amendment campaigns — one to end qualified immunity and another to eliminate property taxes — are preparing for signature collection. If these bills pass, both will face outrageous, politically motivated barriers. That’s not a bug in the legislation. It’s the design.
And what about the so-called “solutions” these bills claim to offer?
Requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote is a dangerous fix to a nonexistent problem. Just ask Kansas, where a similar law blocked over 30,000 eligible voters from registering — until a federal judge struck it down as unconstitutional. Claims of widespread non-citizen voting have been repeatedly debunked. Meanwhile, real people — like a longtime East Cleveland resident wrongly flagged as a non-citizen — pay the price.
As for drop boxes: these secure, monitored ballot return options helped over 180,000 Ohioans cast their vote in November 2024. We need more of them, not fewer. Restricting access only makes voting harder, not safer.
SB 153 and HB 233 would have chilling real-world consequences and set a dangerous precedent. Any lawmaker who says, “If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear,” should take a long look in the mirror. That logic has no place in a democracy. 
This isn’t about partisan politics. This is about power — and who gets to wield it. The answer must remain: the people.

(Photo courtesy of the Metropolitan Public Defender)In September 2023, Ashley, a 29-year-old mother of two who grew up in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, was facing child abuse and neglect charges in a criminal case related to substance use.
Her arrest led to her being separated from her youngest daughter.
But instead of receiving jail time, Ashley was connected with a specialized advocate who took the time to understand her and her case. She completed two inpatient substance-use treatment programs. In April 2024, she started a one-year outpatient treatment program.
By that June, she had reunited with her daughter, who is now 2 years old. And in April 2025 — a year after entering outpatient treatment — Ashley’s criminal case was fully dismissed after she had met every requirement of her court-ordered plan. (Stateline agreed to withhold Ashley’s full name to prevent potential retaliation in the ongoing custody case of her older child.)
When she first entered the courtroom, Ashley recalled, she felt like a “lost puppy.” But through a collaborative defense model spearheaded by the national nonprofit Partners for Justice, she found not just support but strength.
Jaya Duckworth, who has been a client advocate in Los Angeles County for two years, helped Ashley obtain an ID, fill out and sign important documents, and connect to counseling and outpatient treatment.
A high school graduate with some college experience, Ashley now plans to return to school and continue raising her 2-year-old. She’s also working closely with her defense team to regain custody of her 9-year-old daughter.
“Without her help, I don’t think I would have been reunited with my daughter,” Ashley said in an interview with Stateline. “I have my little one here now, and I know that I’m confident to step into that courthouse and keep trying.”
Her experience reflects a growing shift in public defense — one that recognizes that attorney advocacy alone often isn’t enough.
But this shift is unfolding at a time when national momentum is swinging in the opposite direction, with many political leaders renewing calls to crack down on crime through tougher sentencing and increased policing.
Cash assistance may curb recidivism among people leaving prison, study says

“There’s just so much data out there that shows that this approach doesn’t work,” said Alaina Bloodworth, the executive director of the Black Public Defenders Association. Bloodworth previously served as a public defender in Louisiana for six years. “Tough on crime is fueled by emotions. It’s not fueled or based in any type of data.
“It has not worked for us, and it definitely doesn’t work for communities of color.”
A 2019 study by the Rand Corporation and the University of Pennsylvania Law School found that holistic defense — which integrates legal, social and community support — may not only reduce jail and prison time but may also improve long-term outcomes for clients. The study, which compared holistic and traditional public defense models in New York City over a 10-year period, found that holistic representation reduced the likelihood of a custodial sentence by 16% and reduced the expected sentence length by 24%. It also saved taxpayers an estimated $160 million on inmate housing costs.
This model has quietly taken root in pockets of the country — often showing results that are difficult to ignore. As local governments weigh various budget priorities and public safety, some public defenders and advocates are making the case that holistic support isn’t an add-on, but a necessary part of effective legal representation.
“Having holistic defense gives the client the agency and autonomy that they need to decide for themselves,” said Michael Halkias, the chief public defender for Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. “And once people feel empowered to make decisions when they’re in a system that tells them they have no power, I think ultimately it helps them in the long run.”
The county’s office has had client advocates for nearly a year.
 The holistic defense model

Holistic defense, which emerged in the 1990s, pairs legal representation with social support and resources. The goal is not to excuse or overlook criminal behavior, but to address the underlying factors, such as poverty, substance use and trauma, that sometimes drive people into the justice system in the first place.
“When you meet those basic needs, it ensures that they don’t come back to the system,” Bloodworth said. “What I am not trained on is how to truly meet social needs in the way that social workers are trained or client advocates, so having a team of professionals representing someone is truly important to ensure that person actually gets the best representation.”
One of the organizations leading this shift is Partners for Justice, a national nonprofit that began operations in 2018. The group created a collaborative defense model by embedding trained client advocates directly within public defender offices, where they work alongside attorneys as part of an integrated and client-led defense team.
Some of the client advocates are recent college graduates with aspirations to go into law or public policy who commit to two-year fellowships, while others bring firsthand experience from the criminal legal system. The team’s goal is to confront the underlying causes and prevent many of the most dire consequences of criminal legal involvement.
‘Tough-on-crime’ policies are back in some places that had reimagined criminal justice

Today, Partners for Justice has placed advocates in 25 public defense agencies across 17 states. Earlier this year, the organization expanded its reach through new partnerships with the Colorado State Public Defender and the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender.
Many client advocates build their own networks of local service providers to connect clients directly with the help they need.
Sometimes, it’s walking a client through a release from incarceration plan. Other times, it’s simply holding their hand in court — or showing up with something to eat.
“One of the most important parts of my job is to contribute in a small part to restoring the dignity and humanity that the system denies them,” said Duckworth, the client advocate who worked with Ashley, the 29-year-old California mother. She is one of more than 20 advocates working within the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.
The model eases the burden on overworked public defenders by allowing them to focus on legal strategy, rather than juggling the complex needs of dozens of clients at once.
“Our caseloads are high,” said New Jersey Public Defender Jennifer Sellitti. “But at the same time, we’re also creatures of, ‘I’m just going to do it all myself.’”
One of the biggest challenges, she said, was shifting that mindset.
“The biggest hurdle was trying to say to lawyers, ‘We want you just to lawyer,’” Sellitti told Stateline. “But that very, very quickly has turned into an incredible partnership in all three of our pilot offices.”
Since offering the Partners for Justice client advocate program in three offices across Atlantic, Hudson and Monmouth counties in March, Sellitti said, the offices have helped clients access treatment programs more quickly than they would through traditional routes like probation or recovery court.
The collaborative defense model also helps build trust between clients and their defense team. Some client advocates say there’s a common perception among defendants that public defenders don’t care about their clients. But many public defenders are stretched so thin that it’s nearly impossible to give each case the attention it deserves.
“We have been helpful in bridging that communication gap between the lawyers and their clients,” said Paul Boyd, a client advocate with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender in Atlantic County.
Boyd, who spent time in prison, said his background helps him build trust with clients who relate to his experience and therefore better understand the heavy caseloads their attorneys face. That connection, he said, often makes clients more willing to cooperate with their defense team.
 A fragile lifeline in Portland

Budget cuts in some states, though, could threaten the advocacy work.
A program that has helped dozens of defendants in the Multnomah County area of Oregon is now at risk of being cut from two of the county’s major law firms that offer public defense services. The county faces a $15.5 million budget shortfall driven by a pandemic-era drop in property tax revenues.
Public Defenders Were Scarce Before COVID. It’s Much Worse Now.

Among those the program has supported in Portland is a 33-year-old resident and Alaska Native who has lived there for nearly a decade. The resident, who asked that their name not be used out of concerns for safety, was arrested last fall and charged under Measure 11, Oregon’s mandatory-minimum sentencing law. A prison sentence loomed over them.
After spending nearly a month in county jail, they worked with client advocate Cierra Carlson on a release plan — outlining their goals for substance use recovery, going over the resources they wanted to be connected to and naming other steps to keep out of the criminal legal system.
“I was worried that I was going to fall through the cracks, that I was just going to be treated like a number,” they said in an interview with Stateline.
But upon release, they entered a “culturally specific” substance use treatment center that serves people of color. They secured more stable housing, and with Carlson’s help reactivated their food stamps and health insurance.
“I feel way more seen than I have in the past,” they said.
But Carlson’s position could soon be eliminated.
Under Multnomah County’s proposed budget, $621,261 in funding for client advocate or case manager positions at the Metropolitan Public Defender, a nonprofit law firm that contracts with the state to offer public defense services, and Multnomah Defenders Inc. would be eliminated — cutting all six positions across the county. It’s one of many potential cuts that county leaders are looking at to save money.










I was worried that I was going to fall through the cracks, that I was just going to be treated like a number.

Two amendments have been proposed to keep the program, though. One would fully reinstate the $621,261 in funding, while the other would allocate about $415,000, likely resulting in the loss of one or two positions.
The county board of commissioners is expected to vote to approve the proposed $4 billion budget on June 12.
Carlson said she’s worried about what might happen to her clients if the program were cut. “I have seen the difference that it can make.”
The proposed cuts come as Oregon’s public defense system is in crisis.
More than 3,700 people charged with crimes across the state currently have no legal representation, according to the latest state data. More than 1,700 others have missed their court dates after never being assigned an attorney — and now face active arrest warrants.
“Even if this program goes away temporarily, it’s not something that we are going to back away from because it is so critical to our work and to the success and safety of our community, too,” said Grant Hartley, the director of the Metropolitan Public Defender.

Every Tuesday afternoon since mid-February, the busy intersection outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention becomes loud and crowded as allies show their support for the center and its remaining employees.
The rallies emerged after the first round of mass layoffs under the Trump administration and its campaign to shrink the size of the federal government, which has led to a large number of fired employees, funding cuts and the elimination of CDC programs.

Every week, retired CDC employees and people who have lost their jobs take to the streets to express their disappointment and share their collective fear for the future of the CDC. This week, about 20 current CDC workers used their paid time-off to join them. 
By walking out of their offices, the group was able to share a moment of solidarity with the crowd. A few of these employees stepped up to the megaphone, saying they were scared to speak out. Most of these employees remained masked. 
Tony Fiore, one of the many CDC alums in attendance this week, has been at almost every Tuesday rally. Fiore is part of a group of former CDC staffers who help organize the weekly rallies to show their support of their friends still working at the center.
“We thought we’d come out here every Tuesday and show some support, show some love to them, because they’re just getting hammered from all sides,” Fiore said. “They’re getting letters every week telling them they’re worthless government employees.”
Tuesday’s rally came only a day after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. removed each existing member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. This committee advises the CDC on who should receive vaccinations and when. His executive removal came with a pledge to replace the committee with new members of his choosing.
Numerous signs, including one from Fiore, expressed dismay over this decision.
Supporters gathered around three corners of the busy intersection outside the center holding signs high as cars, including some with CDC employees on board, passed. The signs elicited honks, smiles and thumbs up from many drivers.
Recently fired former CDC employee Rosemarie Kobau attended Tuesday’s rally with a sign pleading for the restoration of the CDC’s epilepsy program. After 25 years as a part of the program and 13 years as its team lead, Kobau did not expect to be spending her Tuesdays unemployed and begging for the continuation of epilepsy programming.

Kobau’s team previously worked to promote epilepsy prevention through prenatal care, disorder management and innovative intervention.
“We were supporting many programs and communities across the country and in partnership with large national organizations like the Epilepsy Foundation and the American Epilepsy Society,” Kobau said. “Now all of that work has been stopped.”
As the rally cranked up Tuesday, CDC supporters gathered in a tight clump outside of a nearby CVS where event organizers set up a stepstool and megaphone. Former and current CDC staffers recited their oath of office and then extended an open invitation for anyone to speak. 
This invitation attracted both planned and impromptu speakers.
Kathleen Collomb, a retired CDC employee from the Office on Smoking and Health, said she did not plan on speaking. However, after listening to the testimonies of other speakers she felt moved to voice her concerns.
From behind the megaphone Collomb told the crowd that when asked at a Senate hearing Kennedy did not know that smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in America. The Office on Smoking and Health was one of the many eliminated CDC programs.
“What did this man and DOGE do? They RIFed them and they vaporized the Office on Smoking and Health,” Collomb said, referring to a reduction in force. 
The crowd responded with a cacophony of “boos.”
Before leaving the megaphone, Collomb asked a final question: “How in heaven’s name does that Make America Healthy Again?”
State Rep. Saira Draper, an Atlanta Democrat, joined a long list of passionate voices at Tuesday’s rally. Her message was delivered through rain as a storm moved in. Attendees opened umbrellas and put on ponchos as Draper spoke about her gratitude and support for CDC employees. She also criticized Gov. Brian Kemp for staying silent as hundreds of jobs continue to be lost in Atlanta.
“If there is something I have learned from my time at the Georgia Capitol it is that there is no change without demand,” Draper said to the crowd. “I know sometimes it can seem like you are yelling into the void. I know that, but let me assure you you are not. We are listening and we stand with you.” 





Correction: An earlier version of this story mischaracterized an exchange between Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a senator during a recent hearing. Kennedy was told at that hearing that the leading cause of preventable death in America is smoking.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Stopping the state’s health care system from hemorrhaging is the primary focus of a revised fiscal 2026 spending budget given first passage by a panel of House lawmakers just late Tuesday night.
The $14.3 billion spending plan is roughly $500,000 less than the final fiscal 2025 budget, which after upward revisions hit the high water mark in state history. However, it’s more than the $14.2 billion proposal unveiled by Gov. Dan McKee in January.
The revised version centers largely on additional funding for health care systems and providers, along with new revenue for the cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Agency and an extra $22 million to cover the recent price hike to rebuild the I-195 Washington Bridge. 
“This budget was about making choices,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said, speaking to reporters in a press briefing Tuesday night. “We weren’t going to let public transportation for the state collapse, or primary care. We had to make choices.”
On the chopping block: McKee’s workforce development and high education apprenticeship programs, alongside many of his long-term capital projects, like buying a former Citizens Bank building for state offices, closing the Department of Corrections’ minimum security facility and opening a new state-run, long-term care hospital in Burrillville.
The House Committee on Finance’s 11-3 vote Tuesday sends the updated spending proposal to the full House of Representatives for consideration on June 17. Three Republicans – House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale of Foster, George Nardone of Coventry and Sherry Roberts of West Greenwich voted against the revised budget.
Democratic Reps. Terri Cortvriend of Portsmouth and Ray Hull of Providence were absent.
 Lawmakers must approve a final spending plan before the new fiscal year begins July 1.
Health care 
Shekarchi repeatedly emphasized the need to address the shortage of primary care doctors, calling it both a “crisis” and a “fire” that required immediate attention. 
“We can’t afford to just study it,” Shekarchi said, referring to McKee’s budget plan to study state Medicaid reimbursement rates for future increases.
To that end, lawmakers increased Medicaid reimbursement rates for primary care providers by another $45 million to match Medicare rates — following a proposal championed by Attorney General Peter Neronha. And hospitals will get another $38 million in direct state payments and rate hikes — far short of the $90 million that the Hospital Association of Rhode Island asked for, but more than McKee supplied.
Another $12 million will help struggling nursing homes, accompanied by some version of a staffing requirement.
Shekarchi emphasized that stabilizing the state’s health care landscape was a priority on both sides of the State House rotunda, referencing Senate President Valarie Lawson by name.
Lawson in an emailed statement Thursday touted the primary care investments, as well as those in the public transit agency.

Help for RIPTA 
The cash-strapped bus agency will get a little less than half of the money needed to plug its $32 million deficit. But not from state coffers. Instead, the revised spending plan relies upon an increase in the state gas tax, which presently sits at 38 cents per gallon with a 1-cent per gallon increase every other year. Lawmakers are now adding another 2-cent increase , with $15 million from the expected extra revenue to help RIPTA.
Shekarchi stopped short of acknowledging that the agency may have to cut its fixed routes due to the remaining shortfall, pointing to a not-yet-complete efficiency study that could save costs on staff, operations and equipment. However, services for transit riders with disabilities through the RIPTA RIde paratransit program cannot be reduced or eliminated, as expressly stated in the revised spending plan.
“That is one area that is untouchable,” Shekarchi said of the paratransit program.
Taxes and fees
Despite the strain on state coffers and the rousing cries from advocates, there’s still no contemplation of a tax on top earners in the state spending plan. 
Shekarchi pointed to uncertainty with the federal tax code as reason why he and other lawmakers hesitated to begin a version of the “millionaire’s tax.” However, the revised budget increases the real estate conveyance tax on the sale of homes over $800,000  from $2.30 to $3.75 for every $500 increment above the $800,000 threshold. And, it adds a new property tax on non-owner occupied homes valued at $1 million or more, colloquially termed the “Taylor Swift tax.”
Other new taxes include the extension of the state’s 5% hotel tax to whole home short-term rentals. Revenue from the tax on Airbnb and similar properties would be split between cities and towns, homelessness aid and local tourism districts.
Stricken from the budget: a tax on digital advertising by billion-dollar companies, and a 50-cent increase in cigarette taxes.
The budget preserves proposed registration fees for electric vehicles and an increase in the technology surcharge at the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Education
Unlike in recent years, lawmakers did not significantly upend the education funding formula, which is used to determine state aid to local school districts. The revised budget fills a $12 million shortfall in aid for low-income students, resulting from a correction to the count of students in poverty. And, it repurposes an additional $12 million increase in state aid to students in poverty, instead devoting more funding to aid for special education students.
The budget was revised in the eleventh hour — minutes before Shekarchi began addressing reporters at 9:15 p.m. — to account for a $2 million settlement cost with the state education department. Details were not immediately available.
Shekarchi’s voice showed signs of fatigue as he outlined the revised spending plan, which he called the “toughest budget” in his four years as Speaker of the House.
“There were a lot of holes,” Shekarchi said of McKee’s original spending plan.
McKee’s proposed fiscal 2026 budget failed to account for the extra $15 million cost for new contracts with state troopers and correctional officers, and a $3.2 million overspend on redeemable tax credits owed to production companies that filmed in Rhode Island.
“We had 27 budget amendments and none of those amendments proposed new revenue,” Shekarchi said.
Meanwhile, uncertainty in D.C. has left state lawmakers “flying blind” on major funding sources like Medicaid, Shekarchi said. 
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Tuesday night

Mikie Sherrill won a resounding victory in Tuesday's Democratic primary for governor, winning all but five counties.","Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop conceding defeat in the race for the Democration gubernatorial nomination at Zeppelin Hall in Jersey City on June 10, 2025. (Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The Democrats who lost their party’s nomination for governor to Rep. Mikie Sherrill on Tuesday said they will fight to unite the party and keep the governorship in Democrats’ hands in November.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka told supporters at the Robert Treat Hotel in Newark that Democrats have to make sure Sherrill’s November opponent, Republican former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, “does not win.” Initial results show Baraka coming in second place, about 100,000 votes behind Sherrill.
“What we’re facing is dangerous and ugly and terrible. And terrible. So we have to bring the party together statewide,” said Baraka. “We have to keep fighting and pushing and fighting and pushing and fighting and pushing for working-class families. And I keep saying that because I’m from Newark.”
Baraka’s campaign was jolted in the last month by his arrest by federal agents for trespassing at an ICE jail in Newark, a charge authorities quickly dropped. He described his campaign’s progress as proof that working-class people can defy expectations and build a powerful, grassroots movement, adding, “People didn’t think we would make it this far.”
“This is the beginning. It’s not the end of anything. We want to build a broad-based coalition across this state of community activists, of union, of labor, of progressives across the state of New Jersey, across zip code and nationality, across religion and how you identify,” Baraka said.
Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop called Tuesday a “tough, tough, tough night” while addressing supporters at Zeppelin Hall in Jersey City.
“The state is at a crossroads, and although tonight wasn’t what we wanted, it’s important that we work hard to make sure a Democrat gets elected in November. That’s important,” he said.
Fulop, who will end his third term as Jersey City mayor this year, said he and his wife would be taking a vacation now that the campaign is over. Fulop first announced his gubernatorial run more than two years ago.
“Life goes on, and we’ll continue to fight, make a better Jersey City, and we’ll fight for a better state of New Jersey when we’re back here,” he said.


Sherrill won a resounding victory, nabbing the win in all but six of the state’s 21 counties, according to preliminary vote totals. Late Tuesday, she was leading with 34% of the vote, with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in second place with 20%, and Fulop in third with 16%. Rep. Josh Gottheimer won 12%, teachers union president Sean Spiller captured 11%, and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney was in last place with 7%.
Gottheimer conceded his loss while speaking on a stage at a union hall in Paramus alongside his family. Gottheimer, who campaigned on a dramatic pledge to reduce property taxes by 15%, said he’ll continue to fight for the Fifth Congressional District — which he has represented since 2017 — and will “never, ever stop fighting to protect Jersey.”
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney said he called Sherrill to congratulate her on her win.
“While the outcome is not what we hoped for, I couldn’t be more grateful to every supporter, volunteer, and voter who believed in my campaign and my vision for New Jersey,” he said on social media.
In a statement, teachers union president Sean Spiller congratulated Sherrill while also painting his defeat as one at the hands of “wealthy special interests and insiders.” Spiller’s campaign was fueled by the support of an outside group that spent around $40 million boosting his campaign, with funding entirely from a separate super PAC linked to Spiller’s union.
“I’m incredibly proud of the work we did to drive forward issues of fairness and affordability and proud of the thousands of grassroots supporters who came together to support our campaign,” Spiller said.
Baraka, meanwhile, left the door open to a change in the results.
“Look, the vote’s still coming in, y’all. They didn’t count Newark, Paterson, or Passaic or any of these places yet. Those votes are still coming in. The night is still early. Listen, we’re going to go to sleep and wake up in the morning and see what happens. God bless y’all,” he said.
Clerks in Essex and Passaic counties reported Tuesday night that most of the voting precincts in Newark and Passaic had completely reported their results, while many of Paterson’s precincts had not yet been reported.
Juliana DeFrancesco, 18, was one of Baraka’s roughly 160,000 suporters. DeFrancesco, who voted Tuesday at a Ewing community center for only the second time ever, said cast her ballot for Baraka because he has “a lot of really important social opinions.”
“I think he’s a really good, qualified candidate. I like how he speaks, and I like that he stands up for all people, and I think that’s really important,” DeFrancesco said. “That’s kind of like what this country was founded on, making sure everybody’s equal, everybody has opportunities to get what they want, so I think that’s really important.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Last year’s weather didn’t treat the Chesapeake Bay too kindly, if you ask Bill Dennison.
“It was too wet, and then it was too dry — and always too hot,” said Dennison, the vice president for science application at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.
Those conditions are part of the reason the bay got a “C” on this year’s UMCES report card, down from last year’s all-time high grade of  “C+.”
“The crops didn’t have enough water, so they were not soaking up nutrients,” Dennison said at Tuesday’s release of the report card. “So when it did rain, there were excess nutrients washing into the bay.”
A number of factors contribute to the score, including measurements of aquatic grass growth, water clarity, and harmful nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, which run off from fertilizers and sewage treatment plants, among other sources. Excess nutrents spur the growth of algae, which suck oxygen from the water as they die, creating “dead zones” that kill off underwater life.
Though this year’s score dropped, Dennison and others were quick to point out that the overall trajectory of the bay is more positive. Of 15 bay regions identified in the report only one  has seen a declining trend dating back to the 1980s: the Upper Eastern Shore, which includes the Chester River. Six regions are improving, including Baltimore’s Back and Patapsco rivers, and the rest are holding steady, said Heath Kelsey, director of the Integration and Application Network at UMCES.
Kelsey said the bay has faced “lots of development, lots of population moving in, lots more traffic and impervious surface — and climate change is adding to that, too. But nevertheless, over time, whatever we’re doing is making a difference.”

Yet bay states have fallen short of their 2014 pledges for nutrient reduction: By 2024, according to computer models, nitrogen reduction hit 59% of the goal and phosphorous reduction achieved 92% in the six states, plus Washington, D.C., in the bay watershed. They did meet other goals by that year, including reduced sediment runoff.
Early gains came, in part, from outfitting wastewater treatment plants with enhanced technology so they discharge fewer nutrients. But slowing pollution from what are known as “non-point” sources, such as stormwater runoff from cities and farm fields alike, has been more difficult.
The bay has also responded to the estimated reductions more slowly than expected. From 1985 to 1987, 26.5% of the bay’s tidal waters met water quality standards, according to ChesapeakeProgress, an online resource from the Chesapeake Bay Program. In the most recent assessment, between 2020 and 2022, 29.8% of the bay met those same standards. The numbers have declined steadily since a high point of 42.2% from 2015 to 2017.
A 2023 report from the Bay Program’s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee laid out some reasons for the slow improvement. Computer modeling could be overestimating nutrient reductions, the report said. It also called for increased adoption of non-point pollution reduction measures, and urged governments to consider programs that reward farmers and other landowners based on the success of conservation practices, rather than awarding funds to implement a practice, regardless of the pollution-reduction outcome.
Officials have been drafting a revised bay agreement, with new goals for the states, that could be released for public comment next month, pending a vote from a Chesapeake Bay Program committee.
‘Chaos on the hour’
Meanwhile, cuts — some proposed and others realized — to federal agencies by the Trump administration are adding fresh uncertainty to bay restoration efforts.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland), who appeared via video for Tuesday’s event, said Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin publicly assured him that cuts would not be proposed for the Chesapeake Bay Program, the EPA-led office that leads the bay cleanup effort.
It’s a change from Trump’s first administration, when the president repeatedly proposed cutting the Bay Program’s funding, or zeroing it out altogether, though he was denied by Congress.
“That’s good news, but we know that that’s not the only program important to the health of the bay, which is why we’ll push back against the administration’s efforts to cut other key environmental programs,” Van Hollen said.

President Donald Trump’s proposed budget would slash billions from the EPA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Agriculture, potentially hampering funding for improvements at sewage treatment plants, scientists that study bay wildlife and programs that assist farmers with conservation practices, according to a May news release from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
“It’s chaos on the hour,” Bay Foundation President and CEO Hilary Harp Falk said Tuesday. “We have seen some slightly positive news in the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program getting full funding in the president’s proposed budget, but what we’re also seeing is major cuts to NOAA and major cuts to USGS, including bedrock scientific programs.
“You can’t just pull half of those federal agencies out and expect to have results,” she said.
To Dennison, some of the biggest changes so far have been departures of senior USGS scientists, who focused on monitoring conditions in the bay watershed. Some of them opted for the early retirement plan offered by the administration in order to thin the federal bureaucracy, Dennison said.
At UMCES, officials are also concerned about Trump administration attempts to limit the amount of grant funding that universities can use for overhead, Dennison said.
“We’re doing a lot of the doomsday list-making,” he said, but added that the institution is also trying to keep a level head.
“I think it’s important not to freak out,” Dennison said. “Let’s keep our head down, doing good work. And then, when we’re really confronted with the challenge, we’ll deal with it. But for right now, what we hear is being proposed doesn’t often end up being the reality.”
Despite tough state budget conditions, Maryland officials are trying to plug holes left by the federal government, said Maryland Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz.
In remarks on Tuesday, Kurtz cited the recently passed Chesapeake Legacy Act, which will, in part, let DNR incorporate water quality data collected by community groups such as riverkeepers — potentially filling in gaps caused by federal cuts.
That bill may have been aided by its small price tag: It allocates about $500,000 for a new certification program for conservation-minded farmers.

Kurtz also cited a 2024 law, the Whole Watershed Act, which funds targeted water quality assistance for five communities.
“Where there are things that we’re going to lose, I think we are well-positioned as a state because of the strength of the partnership, to be able to keep that scientific understanding going,” Kurtz said.
A bay restoration ‘enigma’
Dennison said scientists at UMCES have been zeroing in on the Upper Shore, the only region with a declining water quality trend in the center’s report card.
He said the problem is a bit of an “enigma” in an area where a solid number of farmers are using cover crops to prevent erosion between growing seasons, and a significant amount of nutrient-laden poultry litter from area chicken houses is trucked to the Western Shore instead of being spread as fertilizer to Eastern Shore farm fields.
Scientists have a few hypotheses, including that the Upper Shore’s flat elevatio could cause the slow groundwater circulation in the area, which could be delaying observations of progress.
“We’ve put into practice some of these things that we’re seeing positive responses to elsewhere, but they’re slower on the Eastern Shore because it’s such a flat [area with] poorly drained soils. It’s just taken a while for that to happen,” Dennison said.
He said the center will host a series of workshops on the Shore later this month, in collaboration with the Delmarva Land and Litter Collaborative, focused on environmental practices in chicken houses, bringing in farmers and poultry companies.
“We don’t really understand why it’s uniquely degraded, whereas everywhere else in the bay is holding steady or improving, so we’re trying to get at that, but we’re doing it in partnership with the farming community,” Dennison said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/HEADSHOT-100-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska, home to the farthest-north spaceport in the United States, could soon add a second Federal Aviation Administration-licensed space launch facility.
On Tuesday, the University of Alaska’s Geophysical Institute in Fairbanks signed a five-year collaboration agreement with the state-owned Alaska Aerospace Corp.
Though the terms of that agreement are highly technical, Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s draft budget for the corporation indicates that the university plans to seek a FAA spaceport license for the university’s Poker Flat Research Range, which has been flying sounding rockets — smaller rockets used for research — into the upper atmosphere since March 1969, including some earlier this spring.
An FAA license could allow Poker Flat to launch larger rockets, and for commercial purposes, not just scientific ones. Making Poker Flat a “licensed vertical orbital spaceport” could take up to two years, the budget documents state.
It isn’t clear how much the licensing process will cost.
The new collaboration agreement doesn’t specifically list a spaceport license but says that “AAC and UAF will collaborate to develop and offer a combination of spaceport industry services that are more efficient and beneficial to the rocket and satellite industry than working independently.”
AAC and UAF will work to develop common standards and cross-train employees that could work at either the Poker Flat range north of Fairbanks, or the Narrow Cape spaceport in Kodiak.
Nine states have FAA-licensed spaceports, and there are 14 nationally. Only Texas, Florida, California and Virginia have two or more. 
Poker Flat predates the Alaska Aerospace Corp., which launched in 1991 as the state-owned Alaska Aerospace Development Corp. 
The new corporation initially considered Poker Flat for its headquarters and primary launch site, but in 1994, it picked Kodiak instead.

The rockets are used to study the aurora borealis and near-Earth space. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	Poker Flat has stayed a research facility since then, with regular launches of sounding rockets intended to probe the aurora, without a spaceport license.
As far back as 2020, AAC was working with Poker Flat on a commercial spaceport license application for the Fairbanks-area site.
Alaska Aerospace has an annual budget of about $10.5 million, all of which is paid for by federal funds and money the corporation earns. 
Thanks to the physics of a rotating Earth, locations close to the equator have an advantage when used as a launch point for rockets whose orbits are primarily east-west. Polar locations have an advantage for north-south, polar orbits. 
The Kodiak Launch complex and California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base are valuable for rockets heading into polar orbits, because each has wide swaths of ocean to the south, and if a rocket launch fails, debris would fall into the ocean, not on inhabited land.
Vandenberg typically serves large, heavy-lift rockets built by major manufacturers like Boeing and SpaceX, while Kodiak has traditionally flown smaller rockets from commercial companies.
It isn’t yet clear what market Poker Flat might serve; launches there have typically been restricted by Fairbanks to the south, the Canadian border to the east, and the trans-Alaska pipeline to the west.
State budget documents suggest NASA contracts could be available for an upgraded Poker Flat, but since those documents were published, President Donald Trump has suggested significant cuts to NASA’s budget.

Jeff Landry speaks to reporters about his legislative agenda to bring down high auto insurance rates on April 9, 2025. (Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)With just two days left to write new laws in the 2025 legislative session, Louisiana lawmakers have halted the only two insurance proposals this year that critics said would have directly provided relief to homeowners struggling to afford skyrocketing rates. 
Senate Bill 235 and House Bill 356 drew wide public interest as homeowners wait for state officials to rein in the coverage costs. Average homeowner insurance premiums in Louisiana are the eighth highest in the nation, according to the industry news site Insure.com. 
Both were also among the few insurance bills that had bipartisan support, though not quite enough from conservatives. 
Sponsored by Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, Senate Bill 235 would have created an annual tax credit of up to $2,000 for homeowner’s insurance payments. It would have been available to anyone with homeowner’s coverage and an income no greater than 200% of the federal poverty level. The legislation included a provision to sunset the credit after 10 years.  
After narrowly clearing the Senate, Duplessis’ SB-235 narrowly failed in the House as Republicans there tanked it with a two-vote margin, 49-52. 
The other measure, House Bill 356 by Rep. Jacob Braud, R-Belle Chasse, would have required insurance companies to let homeowners who are free of mortgages to purchase “stated value” policies. It would cover the home for a lesser amount chosen by the homeowner rather than for its full market value.
Although the bill is still alive, it’s a mere shell of the version that cleared the House in a 79-20 vote just last week when it drew strong vocal support from Republicans like Rep. Tim Kerner of Lafitte, who called it the only bill he has seen this year that actually helps homeowners with affordability.
The original measure would have required insurers to create stated value policies upon the request of a customer, but Senate lawmakers changed a single word in the bill — from “shall” to “may”  — doing away with the mandate provision that served as the cornerstone on which the rest of the bill relied. 
Rep. Mike Bayham, R-Chalmette, expressed his disappointment over the fate of the two bills in an interview Tuesday, saying the high cost of insurance is the one issue above all others that lawmakers really needed to fix. 
“Everything else seems to be, ‘Let’s pass something and just hope the rates get better,” Bayham said. “I thought Braud’s bill was more direct, and I thought Duplessis’ bill would have provided direct relief even on a limited scale. At the end of the day, we were elected to the Legislature to tackle the insurance crisis.”
Tax credit crash
The version of Duplessis’ bill that reached the House floor would have capped the state’s total annual payouts for the homeowner’s insurance tax credit at $10 million. It also would have made the credit refundable for filers earning less than $25,000 per year, meaning they could have received a cash rebate for the credit. 
However, Rep. Julie Emerson, R-Carencro, gathered enough votes for an amendment to remove the refundable provision and to lower the state’s payout cap to $1 million per year. 
Rep. Neil Riser, R-Columbia, who presented the bill on the House floor for Duplessis, objected to those changes but lost that vote in a 65-29 decision. 
“This bill is to try to help those who need the most as far as homeowner insurance is concerned,” Riser said. 
Emerson said the bill would only shift the cost of high homeowner’s insurance to the broader Louisiana tax base while doing nothing to address the underlying causes of high rates. 
“I don’t think that that gives a lot of incentive for rates to go down when we’re basically subsidizing those rates,” she said. 
House Insurance Committee Chairman Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, who has spearheaded much of the pro-insurance industry legislation this year, rallied his conservative colleagues to oppose Duplessis’ bill by calling out one of the organizations backing it, the Greater New Orleans Housing Alliance. 
Firment took issue with recent text messages from the Alliance that accused lawmakers of doing nothing to pass meaningful insurance reform. He pointed out the group gave a poor rating to Republican Congressman Steve Scalise ahead of his 2024 reelection and a positive rating to the Democratic challenger Mel Manuel, whom Firment called a “radical transgender candidate.”
Questioning the relevance of those comments, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, began interjecting to ask Firment to focus his comments on the bill, but the Grant Parish lawmaker had made his point and yielded the floor.
Louisiana homeowners might get option to insure their properties for ‘stated value’

‘It encourages you to gamble’
Meanwhile Monday in the Senate, members of the upper chamber were approving a neutered version of Braud’s legislation with little discussion. If signed into law, the Senate’s version of the legislation would make no changes to what is already allowed under current law.
Stated value policies are typically customized for homeowners who have paid off all or most of their mortgage and prefer to shoulder the risk of having only partial coverage. They would receive lower premiums in exchange for paying out-of-pocket for any damages, increasing the likelihood of losing their homes entirely in the event of a bad storm or a lawsuit. 
In an interview Tuesday, Braud said there’s no law that would currently stop insurers from selling stated-value policies, but he wouldn’t go so far as to say the Senate changes rendered his proposal a “do-nothing” bill. 
“We’ve gotta start somewhere,” the Plaquemines Parish lawmaker said.
Braud added that he believes passing the neutered version of the bill might not change anything this year, but it could help the idea of stated value polices gain momentum. Braud said he hopes he can get the word “shall” back into the law during next year’s session. 
Pro-industry lawmakers such as Firment opposed Braud’s legislation, arguing it would shift insurance costs to other parts of the state that aren’t prone to hurricanes and would lead to an increase in blighted property from people abandoning their damaged homes after storms.
Ironically, the same group Firment criticized during debate on Duplessis’ bill is aligned with him in opposition to Braud’s bill. 
In a phone interview Tuesday, Andreanecia Morris, president of the Greater New Orleans Housing Alliance, said her organization is sympathetic to the plight of homeowners everywhere who can’t afford insurance, but she believes Braud’s bill doesn’t address the underlying problem of high rates. 
“We’re not fans of encouraging homeowners to go it alone and not have enough insurance to replace their homes should the worst happen,” Morris said. “People can’t afford what they need, and that’s the issue. Solving that problem isn’t gonna be accomplished by just asking them to need less. It’s like asking them to breathe less.”
Lawmakers could be doing more to solve the problem and regulate the insurance industry, she said, adding that Braud’s bill could spell disaster if too many Louisiana residents go underinsured or drop out of the property insurance market altogether. 
“It encourages you to gamble in a way that is unsustainable and could lead to you losing your home,” Morris said. “We learned those lessons after Katrina.”
Braud’s bill is scheduled for a conference committee on Wednesday in which a small group of lawmakers from both chambers try to work on a compromise to get the measure passed.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Law enforcement officers found 900 pounds of methamphetamine in a Burnsville storage locker recently, which led them to raid eight Twin Cities metro locations seeking evidence related to the drug find, as well as evidence of bank fraud, illegal guns and human trafficking, according to a federal court filings.
The details of the raid were revealed in a federal indictment announced on Tuesday against a 27-year St. Paul woman for “assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers” during a protest at one of the search locations, Las Cuatro Milpas in south Minneapolis.
The indictment is filled with details that would seem to be tangentially related to the alleged assault on an officer, but shed light on the larger operation.
The attempt to execute a search warrant in south Minneapolis led to a contentious confrontation last week between a bevy of law enforcement agencies and demonstrators, who feared an ICE raid amid the agency’s increasingly militarized tactics. The indictment also confirms that the operation was not related to immigration per se but was an ongoing investigation of major drug trafficking.
Federal officials say they found the meth — valued between $22-25 million — in Burnsville and were then granted eight search warrants for locations in Bloomington, Inver Grove Heights, Northfield, Burnsville and Minneapolis. They found two gold-plated guns, documents, digital evidence and images from the Brian De Palma film, “Scarface,” which is a common homage of narco-traffickers, according to the indictment.
At Las Cuatro Milpas on East Lake Street last week, officers showed up to serve the warrant wearing the uniforms of ICE, DEA, FBI, the criminal investigation arm of the IRS. The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office was also present as was the Minneapolis Police Department, though only for crowd control.
An ICE spokesperson said the “groundbreaking” operation was Minnesota’s first under President Donald Trump’s Homeland Security Task Force, which he established via executive order on the first day of his second term.
The overwhelming show of force motivated people in the community — fearing an immigration raid — to protest. The demonstration led to clashes with police  A slew of local elected officials questioned the effectiveness and purpose of the law enforcement operation. Gov. Tim Walz called it “chaotic.” Attorney General Keith Ellison said “it seemed like the point was to inflict terror and fear into the community.”
Minneapolis City Councilman Jason Chavez told MPR’s Cathy Wurzer that the operation was intended to intimidate residents. “It felt like a very tactical decision to escalate, cause pain and trauma, to the people that live here in the heart of south Minneapolis, and it felt like an intentional decision to unfortunately scare the people that live here.”
Despite the new information on the south Minneapolis operation, federal law enforcement is still likely to face skepticism in the Twin Cities following the raid, especially given the Trump administration’s escalation of immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which now includes use of the U.S. military.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0710-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Burlington joined dozens of other cities across the U.S. rallying in solidarity with anti-ICE protesters in Los Angeles who faced off with federal troops this week.

Hundreds of people gathered under grey skies in Burlington’s City Hall Park Tuesday to rally against deportations of immigrants in their state and across the country that have ramped up under the Trump administration. 
Along with those in dozens of cities across the U.S., the demonstrators stood in solidarity with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles where the Trump administration deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines this week, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom called unlawful. 
“Although Vermont is a small state, especially in comparison with California, we are not so different,” Cristian Santos, a construction worker and former dairy worker, said Tuesday night. He spoke on behalf of Migrant Justice, a Vermont-based advocacy organization for migrant rights. Rachel Elliott, also with Migrant Justice, translated his words from Spanish to English for the crowd. 
“Here in Vermont, ICE has been attacking our communities and taking away our friends and our family and our neighbors,” Santos said. 
In April, nine migrant farm workers were detained by U.S Customs and Border Protection and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In May, four landscape workers and 10 construction workers were detained by immigration officials in northern Vermont. 
“Is being an immigrant a crime?” Santos said.
“No,” the crowd shouted back. 

Federal officials claimed the troop deployment in Los Angeles was in response to protests against workplace raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials that happened over the weekend. But city and state officials, along with the Los Angeles Police Department maintained that the protests were peaceful and under control by state officials. At least two people detained in those raids have already been deported, according to The New York Times.
“What they’re doing in Los Angeles is preparation for what they want to do to all of us,” Ashley Smith, a book editor in Burlington who was representing the Vermont Coalition for Palestinian Liberation, told the crowd. He, along with about a dozen others in the crowd, all waved Palestinian flags. 
“I got drawn into the whole situation in Los Angeles,” said Andrea Rogers, a retired director for The Flynn venue in Burlington who participated in the rally. They held a sign that said “Put Trump on ICE,” and said they came to the rally to protest the abuse of undocumented immigrants. 
“It’s a Trump-ed up situation,” added their friend, Meg Pond, a retired worker in affordable housing who lives in Shelburne. Pond said they came to the rally to stand with immigrants. 

The protest, where more than half a dozen speakers denounced ICE, was coordinated by Vermont-based advocacy groups including the Vermont Party for Socialism & Liberation, Migrant Justice, Green Mountain Democratic Socialists of America, Vermonters United, and Vermont Coalition for Palestinian Liberation, according to a social media post. 
Speakers emphasized the interconnection between immigrant rights and Palestinian rights, along with the rights of incarcerated people and workers rights. Nikhil Goyal, a sociologist who studies poverty and incarceration at the University of Vermont, told the crowd that President Trump was “waging a campaign of terror.” Along with calling for ICE out of Vermont, Goyal reminded rally-goers that cuts under the Trump administration’s budget proposal would limit access to medical and food benefits like Medicaid and SNAP. 
Migrant Justice led the crowd out of City Hall Park and up Church Street. For nearly an hour the demonstrators filled the city’s pedestrian blocks, marching and chanting while onlookers sitting outside at cafes clapped and cheered them on. When they ended in front of City Hall just before 8:00 p.m., the crowd was encouraged to attend another rally called No Kings Day that will be held on Saturday at 10:00 a.m. at Waterfront Park.
Just before the rally began, a federal judge declined Newsom’s emergency motion filed Tuesday to block further militarization of the city from the Trump administration and the Department of Defense. After the rally, Mayor of Los Angeles Karen Bass imposed an 8 p.m. curfew on a section of the city’s downtown core.

“Donald Trump is behaving like a tyrant, not a President,” Newsom said in a media release about the request for a restraining order. He said the federal government had turned the military against American citizens.
On Monday, California sued the Trump administration over the unlawful deployment of troops in the city. Under federal law, states have to request National Guard troops, but Trump sent troops that had not been requested by California officials. 
“How can it be that we have a criminal in the White House who has more than 34 charges against him, and somehow we who come to this country to work hard and to make our lives better and to make a better life for our family, how are we the criminals?” Santos asked.

Lawyer Jenny Harbine, representing a group of organizations that are questioning the monopoly’s ability to responsibly plan for the future and manage costs, argued she should be able to ask a NorthWestern vice president questions about the apparent contradiction.
“If we’re not able to probe the veracity of those twin assertions, then our advocacy is significantly hampered with respect to issues that NorthWestern has placed before this commission,” Harbine said.
Tuesday was the second day of a hearing on a major rate case filed by NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest public utility. The Montana Public Service Commission continued to hear testimony from witnesses for the utility, including Vice President of Supply John Hines.
Harbine represents a group of organizations that argue NorthWestern is demonstrating “ignorance of climate-related costs and risks” in the decisions it makes — to the detriment of customers — including the cost to keep coal-fired units running at Colstrip.
A lawyer for NorthWestern Energy objected to some of Harbine’s questions about the plant and climate change.
However, in the case of the extra costs and outage in January 2024, Montana Public Service Commission President Brad Molnar allowed her to ask her question given the expertise of the witness.
Hines said he wasn’t aware of the $40 million number in connection with the cold stretch and pointed to another witness as better suited to address some of Harbine’s questions.
A company memo NorthWestern discussed in March 2024 estimated the cost of market purchases at nearly $40 million.
In response to a question from Harbine, however, Hines agreed market purchases would have cost less if the Colstrip unit had stayed online and hadn’t broken down.
But Hines also said the plant was up and running again before the worst of the cold spell, and he said any type of facility will have ups and downs. Also, he said, wind and solar at times don’t produce either.
“That’s why we have a diversified portfolio that encompasses all different types of generation,” Hines said.
Also in response to questions from Harbine, Hines agreed regular “overhauls” are performed on the Colstrip units, previously every four years, and more recently every three years.
He said those overhauls involve a lot of scoping, with 280 miles of pipe within one unit — “It’s an incredible engineering feat.” He compared the work to regular maintenance on a car every 20,000 miles.
Hines said the work is intended to be preventative, but Harbine asked if the plant would still break down, and Hines agreed it would, as it did in 2024.
The current rate case before the commission involves a proposed partial settlement on electric costs among NorthWestern and other parties. However, the group of organizations Harbine represents wants the Public Service Commission to reject it as too risky and costly for customers.
NorthWestern Energy also has hydro power generation, and Harbine asked if the utility had assessed how climate change might affect, for instance, river flow.
Hines said he hadn’t seen any significant deviation “other than normal variation.”
Harbine wanted to know if he had reviewed modeling of future snowpack, but Hines said he was more interested in current snowpack than future predictions.
Harbine, though, pressed Hines on whether NorthWestern had enlisted expertise to assess how changes to snowpack might affect the productivity of NorthWestern’s hydro assets.
Hines stressed NorthWestern evaluates existing conditions, “but as far as hiring a climate scientist to opine about local impacts from a global phenomenon, I’m not even aware of any accurate models that do that.”
He said global warming shows “overall trends,” and it’s possible to do some “geographical narrowing,” but he wasn’t aware of modeling specific to a watershed.
“Have you inquired?” Harbine asked.
“I haven’t inquired specifically, no,” Hines said.
In response to a question about whether he disputes the science of climate change, Hines said it’s “an interesting question.”
Hines said he’s “a bit of a history buff,” and he knows the biggest fire in Montana was in 1910, and a fire in 1988 burned one million acres in Yellowstone National Park.
“So relating events to global changes, I am somewhat cynical about,” Hines said.
In response to Commissioner Annie Bukacek, Hines agreed he was frustrated to see people connect specific incidents to human-caused climate change.
“There’s a lot of pretty significant events that are being (attributed) to climate change, such as fires these days, that were ongoing well before the Industrial Revolution, if you will,” Hines said.
The group Harbine represents is comprised of the Montana Environmental Information Center, the Human Resource Council District XI, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the NW Energy Coalition.

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)In an effort to stem the often lengthy debates and occasional partisan fighting that has encroached on valuable voting time, House Speaker Ryan Fecteau warned the chamber Tuesday that if they weren’t able to get through enough bills this week, “the chair will have to consider having a session on Saturday and Sunday.”
Weekend work has yet to be determined, but the House did wrap before 8 p.m., comparatively early to recent late nights.
One issue that always sparks debate is abortion, and with a slew of bills aiming to roll back the state’s current protections, both chambers had their share of discussion late Monday and Tuesday. However, the Democratic majorities in the Maine Senate and House of Representatives ultimately shot down each effort.
These include: LD 253, “An Act to Prevent the MaineCare Program from Covering Abortion Services”; LD 886, “An Act to Regulate Medication Abortions”; LD 887, “An Act to Make Manufacturers Responsible for Proper Disposal of Abortion Drugs and Require a Health Care Provider to Be Physically Present During a Chemical Abortion”; LD 1007, “An Act to Update the State’s Informed Consent Laws Regarding Drug-induced Abortion”; LD 1930, “An Act Regarding Acts of Violence Committed Against a Pregnant Woman”; and LD 1154, “An Act to Require That Informed Consent for Abortion Include Information on Perinatal Hospice.” 
The bills were initially rejected by the House late Monday and laid before the Senate on Tuesday. Both chambers Tuesday also rejected legislation (LD 682) that would impose criminal penalties for performing an abortion, ban abortions passed viability unless in an emergency, and require reports on each abortion performed that would include race, marital status, and education level of the patient. (Read more about these and other related proposals here.)
With papers frantically shuffling between chambers this week ahead of the planned June 18 adjournment, Maine Morning Star will highlight the biggest items of debate as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what happened Tuesday. 
Both chambers
After passage by the Senate earlier this month, the House voted 75-65 Tuesday night to back LD 1016, one of several proposals to support mobile home park residents in purchasing their parks. (Read more about the bill and the other proposals here. The budget committee also voted in some related funding into the budget on Tuesday.)
A provision that would make it so a simple majority of each chamber can extend the Legislature’s work beyond the statutory adjournment date appears likely to become law. With a 73-71 vote, the House enacted LD 1668 after both chambers gave their initial approval. Currently, two-thirds support in both chambers is needed.
Lawmakers in the House and Senate on Tuesday backed the latest effort (LD 982) to provide the Mi’kmaq Nation the same rights to sales tax revenue on its land that the other three tribes of the Wabanaki Nations were granted in 2022. (Read more about this here). 
The Senate and House opted to “indefinitely postpone” legislation (LD 4) that would establish year-round eastern daylight time, effectively killing the measure. A similar bill (LD 3) that requires approval by the federal government and also adopted by other states in the eastern time zone did pass and is headed to the governor’s desk. 
Members of the House voted 78-69 and the Senate 18-14 in favor of legislation (LD 537) that would prohibit the doxing of a minor. Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth) said the bill imposes common sense guidelines for the treatment of minors and provides important protections for their privacy and safety. Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford) said she took issue with the provision that allows a minor to be able to consent to having their image shared, “rather than having a parent involved.” 
Following the Senate, the House voted Tuesday against a bill that would amend the constitution to require the popular election of the secretary of state, attorney general and state treasurer (LD 455).
Both the House and Senate backed legislation (LD 259) to Establish the Criminal Records Review Commission in Statute, with the House voting 78-68 on Tuesday. Proponents said it would help cement and continue the work of the committee, which is tasked with reviewing issues with expunging criminal records and finding ways to prevent past convictions from holding people back from being productive members of their communities. (Read more about this issue here).
An emergency bill (LD 1920) to prohibit the sale to a person under 21 years old of potentially intoxicating hemp products passed both chambers without a roll call. Because it is an emergency measure, it needs to secure two-thirds support in both chambers during enactment votes. The House met that threshold Tuesday night, with a unanimous 143-0 enactment vote.  
Legislation (LD 1571) to modify certification standards for full-time teachers in public charter schools as well as those for reissuance of educational technician certificates passed both chambers, with the Senate voting 18-14 on Tuesday.
Both chambers have now backed legislation (LD 1427) directing the Criminal Law Advisory Commission to review and analyze the statutes of limitation pertaining to sex trafficking offenses committed against both adult and minor victims.
After initially passing both the House and Senate, a bill (LD 1034) that would decriminalize adult possession of therapeutic psilocybin, found in some mushrooms, failed to garner a majority in either chamber during final enactment votes.
Legislation (LD 1620) to regulate the testing of adult-use cannabis and related products was rejected by the House and Senate.
Nonconcurrent matters
LD 613, a bill supported by the Maine Medical Association that allows terminally ill patients to waive the current 17-day waiting period for access to life-ending medication, will go back to the Senate after the House voted to insist on passage of the bill Tuesday after the upper chamber voted Monday against the measure. 
After LD 1928 squeaked through both chambers last week, the Senate voted 14-20 against enactment on Monday leaving the bill, which would prohibit lodging establishments from using single-use plastic containers — such as mini shampoo bottles — in limbo. The House on Tuesday insisted on its position in favor of the bill.
The House Tuesday insisted on its rejection of LD 371, which would remove the 100-megawatt maximum capacity limit for hydropower to qualify as a renewable resource under the state’s renewable resource portfolio requirement. The Senate had supported the measure. (More on this issue here.)
After initially backing a proposed constitutional amendment (LD 1052) establishing the state auditor as constitutional officer, the majority of the House voted against enactment, putting it in conflict with the Senate, which placed it on the appropriations table.
The chambers split over a tax proposal (LD 1879) that would increase corporate tax rates and use that revenue to support the state’s agricultural industries. After the House backed the measure 77-67, the Senate voted 13-18 in opposition. Critics argued the proposal would ultimately amount to a “tax on consumers.” But tax committee chair Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock) said farmers are competing with large corporations while operating on thin margins. The bill, she argued, gives the state a way to step up for them without placing the burden on working families. (Read more about the bill here.)
Senate action
The Senate voted 19-15 to pass legislation (LD 1138) that seeks to better align the state’s transportation projects and planning under the Maine Department of Transportation and Turnpike Authority with the Climate Action Plan. During debate, Sen. Tim Nangle (D-Cumberland) said the state has limited resources to improve transportation and explained that the committee moved this bill forward because it addresses the simultaneous problems of climate change and a lack of transportation choices. 
Legislation (LD 1666) to expand ranked-choice voting to races for general and special elections for governor, state senator and state representative passed the Senate with a 20-14 vote.
Senators voted 18-14 to pass legislation (LD 497) that clarifies the definition and regulation of significant vernal pools under the Natural Resources Protection Act.
House action
The House voted without a roll call in favor of a proposal (LD 1555) to create a tax credit for employers that pay for or provide in-kind child care for all employees. (Read more about the bill and other related proposals here.)
LD 1099, which would exempt diapers from sales tax, passed without a roll call.  
The House also passed another tax-related measure (LD 1657), which would expand the use of tax increment revenue for affordable housing by adding authorized project costs, such as costs for the development, sale, and operation.

That was the word Utah Gov. Spencer Cox used Tuesday to express his annoyance with a new law that bans certain flags in schools and government buildings while also criticizing Salt Lake City leaders’ move to circumvent the ban by adopting pride and other flags symbolizing diversity and inclusion as official city banners.
“They’re dumb flags and it was a dumb bill,” Cox said curtly when asked during his monthly PBS Utah news conference about Salt Lake City’s response to the flag ban. 
Salt Lake City adopts new banners, sidestepping pride flag ban 

Last month, hours before the new flag ban law took effect in Utah, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall unveiled a proposal to adopt three new city flags: a rainbow one symbolizing support for LGBTQ+ communities, a pink and white one for transgender people, and a red and blue one emulating the Juneteenth flag — all with Salt Lake City’s official white sego lily symbol. That evening, the City Council voted unanimously to adopt the flags. 
Cox allowed HB77, the bill Utah lawmakers passed aimed at banning many flags — including pride or LGBTQ+ flags — from schools and all government buildings to become law without his signature. The bill made Utah the first state in the nation to enact such a sweeping flag ban. 
Though he let it become law, Cox wasn’t a fan of HB77. He described it in a letter as “one of the most divisive bills of the session” and lamented that it didn’t result in a compromise.
Supporters of the flag ban, sponsored by Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, have argued it was meant to promote “political neutrality” in government spaces. But critics argued the broad ban would invite free speech litigation while also leaving some Utahns, especially the LGBTQ+ community, feeling unwelcome and erased. 


Cox could have vetoed the bill, but he indicated in his letter that it would likely have been overridden by the Republican-supermajority Utah Legislature. Instead, he urged lawmakers to “consider commonsense solutions that address the bill’s numerous flaws.” While Cox said he agreed with the “underlying intent” to bring “political neutrality to the classroom,” he also wrote “unfortunately, this bill does not do that.” 
“As tired as Utahns are of politically divisive symbols, I think they are also tired of culture war bills that don’t solve the problems they intend to fix,” Cox wrote in his letter. 
On Tuesday, Cox called the ongoing debate over the flag ban and Salt Lake City leaders’ response “ridiculous.” 
As Sundance leaves, Utah Gov. Cox allows first-in-the-nation flag ban to become law without his pen

“You know, I feel bad for Japanese Americans. I feel bad for Polynesian Americans. I mean, who are we leaving out, here?” Cox said of Salt Lake City’s new banners. “I’m sure they feel great that they got around this dumb law, and they did it with dumb flags. The whole thing’s dumb.” 
Pressed on what he thinks should be done instead, Cox said, “We should raise the American flag, and let’s unify around that. It’s a great flag. It represents everyone. And the Legislature doesn’t need to be in everybody’s business all the time.” 
Cox let out an exasperated laugh before adding: “we’re living in the dumbest timeline right now. That’s all I can say.” 
In response to a request for comment on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Salt Lake City Mayor’s Office said “we’ve had an overwhelmingly positive response” from Salt Lake City residents for the newly adopted city banners. 
Lee, in a post on X responding to Cox’s comments on Tuesday, wrote: “So the bill to stop the divide and get everyone to raise one flag… was dumb?”

Mikie Sherrill defeated five other Democrats to win her party's nod for governor Tuesday, the Associated Press projected.","Rep. Mikie Sherrill speaks to supporters after winning the Democratic gubernatorial primary at the Westin Governor Morris in Morristown on June 10, 2025. (Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Rep. Mikie Sherrill won the Democratic primary Tuesday in her bid to become New Jersey’s next governor, the Associated Press projected, riding a wave of establishment and popular support that coalesced around her perceived electability in this fall’s general election.
Sherrill, a former federal prosecutor and Navy helicopter pilot, had long been the party’s favorite, leading in polls and picking up more county organization endorsements than any of her five rivals. But her victory was far from assured, with New Jersey in unknown waters since the courts toppled the powerful county line, which had historically given party-endorsed candidates prime placement on ballots and usually guaranteed a win.
Sherrill used her victory speech to target her GOP opponent in November, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, and President Donald Trump. She said the United States is “too beautiful to be beholden to the cruelty and self interest that Jack and Trump are trying to foist on her.”
“The president comes here nonstop to his golf course, and he calls our state a horror show. Come November, we’re sending a shot across the bow. We are sending a message, because it’s usually the people who have something to prove that work the hardest. Hey, New Jersey, I’ve got something to prove!” she said.


Sherrill, 53, of Montclair, won her congressional seat in 2018 in her first-ever run for public office, flipping a seat that had long been held by a Republican after 12-term incumbent Rodney Frelinghuysen retired. Voters in the 11th Congressional District, which covers parts of Essex, Morris, and Passaic counties, have reelected her three times since then.
Ciattarelli and Sherrill will face off in their bids to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who is barred from seeking a third term this year.
Bishop Jethro James is senior pastor of the Paradise Baptist Church and president of the Newark, North Jersey Committee of Black Churches. He joined throngs of jubilant supporters who packed into the Westin Governor Morris in Morristown to cheer her win.
“The reality is, the best man for a job is a woman,” James said. “I believe that her integrity speaks for itself. She understands real conditions of people and purpose. The other candidates are strictly politics. That’s not Mikie Sherrill. She understands a national budget, but she understands a kitchen budget.”

Anjali Mehrotra, a national board member of the National Organization for Women, said she’s “an original Team Mikie.”
“I’ve been waiting for her to run for governor for two years now,” Mehrotra said. “I would like to see more women elected in office, and not just because I feel like we need representation, but actual research shows that women govern differently because they’re more empathetic, they’re more collaborative, and frankly, they’re more about the issues that I care about. Do I see a man fighting for universal child care? Probably not.”
Sherrill’s rivals had tried to disrupt her momentum by disparaging her as the establishment candidate during a time when many Democrats are disillusioned by their party and looking for seismic change.
But the “machine politician” insult failed to stick, likely because she has been in politics for less time than any of her campaign rivals aside from Sean Spiller.
Still, she and rival Steve Fulop, Jersey City’s mayor, led the race in spending, with both shelling out almost $9 million in what has become New Jersey’s most expensive primary in state history. Sherrill also got a nearly $4 million boost in spending by independent expenditure groups.
Whoever replaces Murphy will be tested in unprecedented ways, as the Trump administration increasingly attacks states’ sovereignty by cracking down on state and local officials who don’t embrace or at least allow its immigration enforcement, cost cuts, and other policies that have led to nationwide upheaval.
Most Democrats in the race, consequently, focused on resistance to Trump as a go-to campaign promise.
Sherrill said she’s the candidate best positioned to fight back against Trump. And her supporters believe she can do it too.
“She’s done it in Congress. She did it when he was in his first term, and she’s continuing to message in a way that makes me very confident that she’ll keep our state very safe and following the Constitution, which she has sworn an oath to, over and over again,” said Tricia Maguire of Middletown, who brought her 22-year-old daughter Fiona to Sherrill’s victory party.
Though Ciattarelli is seeking to tie Sherrill to Murphy in hopes that New Jersey voters are tired of Democratic policies dominating in Trenton, Sherrill on Tuesday said she, not Ciattarelli, is the change agent in the race.
“I am ready to shake up the status quo. He’s not a change, he’s a rerun. He’s the ghost of elections past,” she said.

I think race was definitely a factor,” said Dr. Matthew Barreto, faculty director of the UCLA Voting Rights Project, during […]","U.S. District Court Middle District of Florida Tampa Division via flmd.uscourts.gov.An expert witness testified Tuesday that race was absolutely a major factor in how one Florida Senate district was drawn during the reapportionment process by the GOP-controlled Florida Senate in 2022.
“I think it’s clear. I think race was definitely a factor,” said Dr. Matthew Barreto, faculty director of the UCLA Voting Rights Project, during testimony in the federal trial taking place in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa.
The ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights and Racial Justice Clinic at New York University are challenging the constitutionality of the 2022 Florida Senate redistricting plan because they claim that the Tampa Bay area district was racially gerrymandered.
“Race was used and can explain where the boundary lines are,” Barreto added, discussing the report he produced for the ACLU of Florida, which asked him to analyze the “enacted” map of Senate District 16. The district includes a portion of South St. Petersburg before stretching across Tampa Bay to join a substantial part of Hillsborough County. It’s held by Democrat Darryl Rouson.
Three plaintiffs who live in St. Petersburg and Hillsborough County testified on Monday that they had their equal-protection rights violated by the Legislature’s movement of Black voters into District 16 and removal from nearby District 18, reducing their influence there. The defendants are Senate President Ben Albritton and Secretary of State Cord Byrd.
Testimony throughout Tuesday was filled with political science references like ecological inference, racially polarized voting, and cohesion to break down the racial composition of Florida legislative districts. A lengthy discussion of statistics was at times mind-numbing.
Barreto emphasized that the Senate drew District 16 deliberately to include more Black voters than white ones, referencing how the drawing left out the city of Gulfport, which sits right next to South St. Petersburg, as one specific example.
Alternative maps
The other legislative redistricting expert called to the stand on Tuesday was Penn State statistics professor Cory McCartan, who was asked earlier this year by the ACLU of Florida to draw up a version of Senate District 16 that would be located exclusively in Hillsborough County while still complying with the Florida Constitution.
McCartan created three alternative maps for the ACLU that changed the composition of several other nearby Senate districts in Tampa Bay while still keeping Hillsborough by itself.
Attorney Tara Klimek Price, representing the Florida Senate, was aggressive in trying to poke holes in the testimonies of both Barreto and McCartan, while Mohammad Jazil, the attorney representing Byrd, questioned both men about their objectivity.
McCartan initially responded that he wasn’t sure whether he was a registered Democrat. When asked by Jazil whether he would like to see more Democrats elected he responded, “It depends on who the Democrat is.”
Jazil got Barreto to acknowledge that some of the organizations he has worked with have done work for Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, and the Democratic National Committee.
The morning began with attorneys for the ACLU of Florida questioning Jay Ferrin, who served as staff director of the Florida Senate Committee on Reapportionment in the fall of 2021. He testified that GOP legislators never asked him to draw up a Senate map that would have placed a district solely in Hillsborough County while ensuring that parts of south Pinellas County would not suffer from “diminishment.”
Under the Fair Districts Amendment’s “non-diminishment standard” placed by the voters into the state Constitution in 2010, districts cannot be drawn in a manner that “diminishes” the ability of minority voters to elect their preferred candidate of choice.
While Ferrin was never asked to draw up such a map, which the ACLU contends would have avoided this predicament, attorneys for the plaintiffs have focused on former Orange County Democratic state Sen. Randolph’s Bracy’s comment during the committee meeting in the fall of 2021 that the Reapportionment staff should “look into the matter.”
Daniel Tilley, an attorney with the ACLU, challenged Ferrin that to speculate whether it was possible to draw such a Senate district just in Hillsborough County that would not have protected against diminishment. Ferrin said it was “hard for me to speculate.”
Where’s Bracy?
Meanwhile, the whereabouts of former Sen. Bracy has become an issue during the first two days of the trial. ACLU lawyers hoped to bring him to the stand late Monday before acknowledging that he wasn’t present.
After attorneys again told the three-judge panel on Tuesday that Bracy had yet again failed to appear, Justice Thomas Barber said that in a previous trial when a witness did not appear, U.S. marshals were called to retrieve the witness.
In this case, a court officer called Bracy during a morning break, when he reportedly answered and said had not been personally served with a subpoena but had just found it at one of his residences. He then said that he previously told the plaintiffs in the case that “he did not want to be involved,” according to Justice Barber.

Kay Ivey issued a news […],"Gregory Hunt was convicted of the 1988 murder of Karen Lane in Walker County and sentenced to death. He was executed Tuesday by nitrogen gas. (Alabama Department of Corrections)The state of Alabama Tuesday executed Gregory Hunt by nitrogen gas for his role in the 1988 murder of Karen Lane.
It was the third time the state had put someone to death for the year.
Hunt did not have any final words before the start of the execution.
Gov. Kay Ivey issued a news release shortly after the Alabama Department of Corrections carried out the execution and announced the time of death at 6:26 p.m.
“Tonight, the state carried out the lawfully imposed punishment for Gregory Hunt who is undeniably guilty,” Ivey said in the news release. “And after his last-minute attempts to evade justice, he has faced the consequences of his evil crimes against Karen Lane, actions he has admitted to, even in a letter to the victim’s heartbroken father.”
According to media witnesses, Hunt gasped and raised his head off the gurney. He moaned just before 6 p.m. and raised his feet, before he gasped to breathe again with long pauses in between.
A statement from Lane’s family thanked Walker County District Attorney’s Office, the Alabama Attorney General’s Office and Victims of Crime and Leniency, a nonprofit organization that helps and advocates for victims.
The statement also said that the night was not about Hunt and not about closure, but about Lane’s death and what she endured.
“Karen was shown no mercy, she was not given a second chance,” the family said in the statement. “Karen was shown no grace.”
It ended with the words that Betty Sanders, Lane’s mother, inscribed on headstone.
“Crime will not decrease until being a criminal becomes more dangerous than being a victim,” the headstone says.
Hunt was charged with three counts of capital murder after he killed Lane in an incident that included other aggravating circumstances: burglary and sexual abuse. A jury convicted him of the charges in 1990 and recommended he be put to death by a vote of 11-1.
Hunt filed a lawsuit last month in Walker County Circuit Court claiming he did not sexually assault Lane and argued the medical examiner in the case presented false and misleading testimony that led to his conviction and getting sentenced to death.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office said the rules prohibit Hunt from filing the lawsuit because he has already gone through the appeals process and the law bars him from making a successive appeal.
Hunt is the third person that Alabama executed for the year, and the second by nitrogen gas, after Alabama put James Osgood to death in April by lethal injection. Demetrius Terrence Frazier was put to death in February by nitrogen gas.
Alabama executed six people in 2024, the most of any state for that year.
Opponents of the death penalty urged Ivey to reconsider her position for Hunt’s execution in a petition delivered to the governor’s office Monday.
“Greg Hunt has spent his life in prison introducing his fellow prisoners to the teachings of Jesus,” Hood said in a statement. “Based on the ravenous need for vengeance and continued executions, it’s pretty clear to me that Greg and his fellow prisoners know much more about the teachings of Jesus than the State of Alabama does.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gregory-Hunt-horizontal-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s Republican voters selected former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli as their nominee for governor Tuesday, the Associated Press projected.
Ciattarelli, 63, a Somerset County native, prevailed over four opponents to claim the GOP nod, defeating former radio host Bill Spadea and Sen. Jon Bramnick (R-Union) as well as longshot candidates Justin Barbera and Mario Kranjac, a former Englewood Cliffs Mayor.
“We won because our campaign is about people, not politics. It’s about vision, not division. We won because of our positive energy. We won because we talked about the issues that mattered,” Ciattarelli said at a campaign party in Holmdel Tuesday night.


Ciattarelli’s Tuesday victory was resounding. He won 68% of the vote, came in more than 200,000 votes ahead of his closest opponent, and nabbed the win in all of the state’s 21 counties.
His victory address veered into attacks against Rep. Mikie Sherrill — whom Democratic voters on Tuesday selected as their nominee for governor — offering New Jersey voters a preview of what they can expect to hear over the next 146 days.
The Republican nominee likened Sherrill to incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy, saying she would offer more of the same, and alleged she had benefited financially from her congressional tenure.
“Here’s something else Mikie did during her time in Congress: She got filthy rich. As congresswoman, she bought and sold hundreds of stocks, more than tripling her own net worth to more than $10 million, and when she was questioned on it, she had the audacity to say, quote unquote, ‘I got really lucky.'”
Ciattarelli, a former Somerset County freeholder who has run twice before for governor unsuccessfully, came into the primary with several advantages.
Most of the state’s Republican county committees backed his bid, as did President Donald Trump, who remains something of a kingmaker in GOP primaries.
He was the only one of the Republican candidates to obtain $5.5 million in public matching funds, and he did so by March 28, earlier than any rival on either side of the aisle.
Despite Bramnick’s decades-long legislative career and Spadea’s presence on morning airwaves, New Jersey voters were more familiar with Ciattarelli.
In 2017, Ciattarelli eschewed an Assembly reelection campaign to seek the governorship but lost the nomination to then-Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, 47% to 31%.
In 2021, Ciattarelli pursued the nomination as a moderate, with the more Trumpian primary opponents splitting the vote. He won the GOP nod but lost that November to Murphy, who won reelection by about 84,000 votes, about 3.2 points. Ciattarelli said he would seek the governorship again just 10 days after polls closed.
He shifted to the right in the intervening years and has pledged that his attorney general would not sue the federal government over Trump’s executive orders.

Republicans Joyce and Carmen Crea of Ewing both voted for Ciattarelli.
“The last time, we think he got robbed,” said Joyce Crea, 72.
The couple, both retired state employees, said affordability and immigration top their concerns.
“Who can afford the property taxes in New Jersey? And he’s going to help lower the taxes, he says. We shall see,” Joyce Crea said. “But we can’t afford to live in New Jersey, and Murphy says: ‘If you don’t like it, then move out.’ Who wants to move out of a state we were both born in, and why would we leave here? Our family’s here. Why leave?”
The state needs a Republican governor for a change, she added.
It remains to be seen how Ciattarelli’s growing closeness with the president will prove a bane in November. Though Trump lost New Jersey 52% to 46% last year, he came closer then to winning the state than any Republican presidential nominee since Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush by 2.4 points in 1992.
Ciattarelli is not shying away from Trump yet, using his victory speech Tuesday to mock Sherrill for her Trump criticism.
“Mark my words, mark my words. While we focus on these key New Jersey issues, my Democratic opponent will do everything in her power to change the subject. Trust me: If this campaign were a drinking game and you took a shot every time Mikie Sherrill says Trump, you’re going to be drunk off your a** … every day between now and November 4th,” he said to applause from the crowd.

Rep. John Winter made the remark while discussing logistics for a tour of the former internment camp, where more than 14,000 Japanese Americans were held against their will during World War II.
The post Wyoming lawmaker uses slur for Japanese people before visiting Heart Mountain internment site appeared first on WyoFile .","On Tuesday, a group of legislators visited Heart Mountain Interpretive Center, which exists to remember anti-Asian discrimination and the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. 
Before the tour, Joint Agricultural Committee Chairman Rep. John Winter used an anti-Japanese racial slur while discussing the historic site.
Closing out a morning of testimony and lawmaker discussion on agricultural and public land issues, Winter, who is from Thermopolis and represents a district that includes a portion of Park County, took a minute to remind his fellow lawmakers of the upcoming visit to Heart Mountain. 
“If you’re gonna go to the,” Winter said, before pausing, “Jap camp, that’s what I call it, we need to leave here by about 12:30,” he said with a chuckle.
WyoFile reviewed a livestream video of the meeting.
The slur stretches back to the war but has been largely abandoned as offensive and dehumanizing toward Japanese people. The word is labeled disparaging and offensive by every major dictionary, an online search reveals, and has been dropped from popular use long ago. An association of major newspapers in New York, for example, urged dropping the term in the early 1950s after a campaign by Japanese American activists.
“The excuse that the term ‘Jap’ is usually used without any derogatory intention is pointless,” activist Shosuke Sasaki wrote in a letter to the association, according to the Japanese American history organization Densho. “It frequently has been and is being used with the connotation of contempt.”

“It’s unfortunate that now, in 2025, we still hear language like this,” Heart Mountain Interpretive Center Board Chair Shirley Ann Higuchi told WyoFile in a phone interview Tuesday. Her parents were among the more than 14,000 Japanese Americans interned against their will and under guard at Heart Mountain during the war. 
“I feel that Rep. Winter should become better educated,” Higuchi said. “If someone made that comment to me anywhere I would have to speak to them about the appropriateness of that description.” 
Winter, a Republican who’s been serving in the House since 2019, did not respond to two voicemails and a text message from WyoFile seeking comment Tuesday afternoon. 
It was appropriate for the agricultural committee to visit Heart Mountain, Higuchi said, because the people interned there – many of them farmers uprooted from California – contributed to the history of the industry in that part of Wyoming. “It’s an agricultural committee, you’d think they would respect what we did there historically, and it’s unfortunate this remark put a sour taste in everybody’s mouth.”  
In the video, three of Winter’s fellow lawmakers are visible when he makes the response. Two smiled and a third dropped his head down in a rueful manner.

The committee’s lone Democrat, Rep. Karlee Provenza of Laramie, said the current presidential administration’s focus on deporting mass numbers of immigrants, and widespread concerns that federal agents are depriving people of their civil rights while doing so, makes Heart Mountain’s historic lessons more important than ever. 
The internment of Japanese Americans was “a horrific display of what happens when we strip people of their constitutional liberties and their civil rights,” Provenza said. “I guess I’m just grateful we were able to take a tour of Heart Mountain after that committee meeting so that my colleagues were able to see just how awful the government’s treatment of Japanese Americans was, so that we never do anything like this again.” 
Winter’s comment came just three months after the death of renowned U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, who grew up in Cody and made remembering Heart Mountain, and condemning that dark chapter of the nation’s history, a focus of his public persona and political advocacy. Simpson is famous for his lifelong friendship with Norman Mineta, after the two met as boys while Mineta was interned at the camp.

Mineta went on to serve as a U.S. congressman from California, and the two men, though of opposite political parties, worked together to pass the 1988 Civil Liberties Act, which included an apology and $20,000 to those internees still alive at the time. 
The Heart Mountain Interpretive Center is preparing to honor Simpson this summer, Higuchi said. 
Winter also grew up in northwestern Wyoming. In the committee meeting he noted that growing up, he had lived in refurbished barracks from the internment center. “They can be made pretty nice,” he said. 
Tim French, the committee’s Senate chairman, told WyoFile he and Winter lived just a few miles from each other in their youth. French’s family came to the area after the war as homesteaders. Families of veterans, like his, received portions of the acreage used for the Heart Mountain internment center, according to a National Park Service history. They purchased barracks buildings from the federal government at extremely low prices and moved the structures to their ranches. They were very cold domiciles in the winter if not refurbished, French said. 
The state senator, a Republican from Powell, said he was “a little shocked when co-chairman Winter said that.” But it was also a memory of his childhood, French said, when children of the area referred to Heart Mountain by that term, which they had picked up from their parents. French, who is in his early 70s, said the two area lawmakers are only a few years apart in age. 
Their parents were mostly veterans of the war, he said, and “that was the term. They were still angry. I grew up with that term. I didn’t know any better. It wasn’t a vicious term growing up, it’s just that’s what it was.” But with time, he said, and after getting to know a Japanese-American family who moved in nearby him, he learned to drop the slur from his lexicon. 
“I decided ‘gosh, I grew up with that, but I’m not going to use it any more,’” he said. “You mature and you grow up.” 
Area history aside, Winter, French said, “shouldn’t have said it.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Just weeks after signing a budget that relied on spending cuts and new taxes to balance, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson is telling state agencies to tighten their fiscal belts even more.
The warning from the Democratic governor comes amid an increasingly gloomy budget outlook and underscores that the state’s financial difficulties are not over.
“We will very likely continue to face a challenging state budget environment in the coming year and anticipate increasing caseloads and ongoing uncertainty in the economy and federal funding,” reads a June 4 memo from Ferguson’s budget director to agency leaders and presidents of higher education institutions.
The letter penned by K.D. Chapman-See, director of the Office of Financial Management, precedes departments and colleges submitting funding requests that they hope Ferguson will support heading into next year.
Those submissions are due by Sept. 15. Ferguson will release his proposed spending plans in December and the Legislature will consider them in the 2026 session.
The letter says requests should only be for “critical and emergent costs” that cannot be covered within their existing budgets. It urges them to look for “additional options for efficiencies, reform, administrative savings, or reductions in non-essential services and programs.”
The tone of Chapman-See’s memo echoes a directive issued a year ago by her predecessor in which agency directors were told to focus on maintaining current programs, while not seeking money for new ones or expansions.
Five months later came the November memo that, for the first time, identified a projected budget shortfall between $10 billion and $12 billion over the next four years.
Once Ferguson settled into office, he started saying the chasm had widened to $16 billion.
Democrats used their majorities in the House and Senate to pass a two-year $78 billion budget that was balanced with spending cuts and billions of dollars in new and higher taxes. The tax package Democrats assembled totals around $9.4 billion over four years to fully cover the gap. 
Ferguson, whose vetoes left the state with a little less savings, warned the fiscal situation could worsen when the next forecast of state tax collections is released on June 24.
On Tuesday, Washington chief economist David Reich offered a sense of what to expect when he delivered his quarterly review of the economy to the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council, a bipartisan panel of state lawmakers and agency executives, including Chapman-See.
It didn’t sound good. Tax collections are coming in lower than predicted in March. Uncertainty surrounding tariffs, trade and federal policies are having a chilling effect on exports, consumer spending, and general activity across many sectors.
While there was an uptick in sales of new vehicles, Reich said, it might have been folks rushing to beat new or higher tariffs. Sales of expensive properties generated a few more dollars than anticipated, he said. But new housing starts are behind March projections.
Prior to his presentation, the council adopted a new four-year outlook showing Washington will have less money on hand at the end of the next budget cycle than previously estimated.
The state will have an ending balance of $80 million in its main operating account at the end of the 2025-27 biennium, down from the $225 million penciled in before lawmakers approved the budget in April.  Projections show the operating account will be in the red to the tune of $56 million in the 2028 fiscal year before rebounding to a positive sum by July 1, 2029.
Washington isn’t in any immediate budget danger and has more than $2 billion in emergency reserves.
Still, Chapman-See said the financial situation is why agencies are being pressed to further reduce spending. And, she said, it is anticipated that travel, hiring and contracting freezes imposed this fall will remain in place.
Democratic budget writers from the House and Senate who serve on the council said there’s nothing for lawmakers to do, yet.
“I’m not sure what we can do before January,” said Sen. June Robinson, D-Everett, the lead budget writer in the Senate. “There are a lot of pieces of information that will be collected and considered, including what the federal government might do between now and then.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1680-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

The Laboratory is planning to vent headspace gases from four of these containers. (Photo courtesy Los Alamos National Laboratory)The New Mexico Environment Department says Los Alamos National Laboratory will need to meet additional conditions before the state will sign off on a release of radioactive gas, and lambasted the lab for allowing the problem to mount over decades. 
The issue concerns four containers the lab packed in 2007, which contain radioactive gas tritium and some hazardous waste, and require pressure release by 2028 in order to be transported and disposed of. LANL has requested state officials sign off on a plan to release small amounts of gas over time to relieve the pressure, and said the releases will not harm the environment and human health. 
Tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, can be naturally occurring or a byproduct from nuclear research, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA characterizes the gas as a lower threat, emitting radiation that often cannot penetrate the skin and leaves the body quickly when consumed as tritiated water. 
In a June 9 letter to officials at the National Nuclear Security Administration and private contractor Triad National Security, which operate LANL, NMED Secretary James Kenney decreed the lab will need to hire an independent technical reviewer for the plan; hold public meetings and tribal consultations; and submit to an audit of hazardous waste disposal operations, before approval will be given. 
“In closing, the historical gross mismanagement of these waste streams by DOE and NNSA have placed NMED in an untenable situation. Now, the risk of inaction poses a far greater threat than a technical solution, but no technical solution is free from risk,” Kenney wrote. “Your disregard of state laws and rules governing these wastes for almost 20 years greatly exacerbated this situation and put New Mexicans, tribal communities, and our environment at risk.”
The state believes the laboratory can conduct the steps needed for approval within three months, New Mexico Environment Department Resource Protection Division Director Rick Shean said in an interview with Source NM Tuesday. 
He said the time pressure from LANL on the plan could have been mitigated in the years since the waste containers were found in 2007. 
“If they had dealt with that closer to that discovery time, we wouldn’t be in this situation right now,” Shean said. “So it was their lack of action when the problem was identified that has made this problem worse.”
The letter accompanied a complaint the New Mexico Environment Department filed over a failure of the federal government to fund the state’s independent oversight of national lab activities. While the funding was eventually restored, the complaint said, the department incurred a little more than $8,400 in administrative costs and jeopardized water, air and soil monitoring programs — including for tritium releases. 
The complaint requests that federal officials sign a commitment for future funds, issue reports to Congress on the funding and explicitly request the NNSA be named as a responsible party.
Federal officials have the chance to appeal the complaint in a hearing process before NMED.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)For the second day in a row, Coloradans protested against the mass deportation campaign being carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents across the country and an escalating military crackdown by President Donald Trump’s administration on anti-ICE demonstrators in Los Angeles.
A crowd of more than 1,000 people Tuesday evening gathered on the lawn of the Colorado Capitol and along Lincoln Street near Civic Center Park in Denver for an emergency “ICE Out” rally organized by the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.
“This is more than a protest. It’s a call to defend our future,” Raquel Lane-Arellano, communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, said in a press release. “The Trump administration is trying to turn our government into a weapon—unleashing the military on immigrants, workers, and anyone who won’t bow to their agenda.”
A breakaway crowd of hundreds, mostly younger people, then marched south from the Capitol, shutting down traffic on Broadway and Lincoln Street. The marchers were met by a line of law enforcement officers including Denver police and Colorado State Patrol near the interchange between Broadway and Interstate 25. The crowd gradually thinned out as police warned demonstrators they would be denied access to the highway. Officers in riot gear deployed smoke and pepper balls to disperse the crowd after a standoff lasting about 30 minutes.

Other protesters remained at the Capitol throughout Tuesday evening’s demonstration.
“We are here right now because our neighbors are being attacked left and right,” Nayda Benitez, an advocate with CIRC, told the crowd. “I’m a proud immigrant. I could not be here without my mom, without my family.”
The Denver Police Department made 17 arrests related to the demonstration, according to a statement the department emailed Wednesday morning.

Anti-ICE protests continued for the fifth consecutive day in Los Angeles, where Mayor Karen Bass on Tuesday night announced the imposition of an 8 p.m. curfew. Trump has ordered a detachment of 700 U.S. Marines and thousands of federalized National Guard troops to deploy to L.A. over the objections of state and local leaders, the first such move by a U.S. president since 1965. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sued to block the deployments, which he said “crossed a red line.” Trump on Monday suggested Newsom, whom he did not accuse of any crime, should be arrested.
The Denver demonstrations followed a march on Monday to the gates of the ICE detention center in Aurora, where a daily average of more than 1,100 people are detained as they await deportation or other immigration proceedings.
Splintering demonstrations
Shortly after 6 p.m., as the size of the crowd at the Capitol swelled, a breakaway group chanting and bearing signs with anti-ICE slogans blocked an intersection at Lincoln and 14th streets.
Much of the crowd then marched south from the Capitol along Lincoln Street before crossing to Broadway. As the crowd marched, Denver police continued to shut down multiple intersections nearby but did not engage protesters or order them to disperse.

“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” the crowd chanted. Despite causing traffic to back up in several locations, they were met largely with supportive honks and cheers from drivers.
“Come back for music afterward, people,” a proprietor at a bar and lounge on Broadway shouted to the crowd as it passed.
Javier Calzada, a demonstrator wielding a flagpole that flew both the Mexican and American flags, told Newsline he had immigrated from Mexico 27 years ago, and was on the scene Tuesday to “keep the peace.”
“We don’t support the attacks on our community,” Calzada said. “We’re here to protect ourselves.”
Many marchers began to turned back as the demonstration crossed Alameda Avenue. A smaller crowd continued south on Broadway until participants were stopped by law enforcement officers in tactical gear north of the I-25 interchange, where police broadcast a public-address announcement warning protesters to turn back from the highway and threatening the use of “chemical munitions.”

About 30 minutes later, a Denver police officer, citing the protest’s blocking of a roadway, ordered the crowd to disperse. Shortly afterwards, police deployed several canisters of chemical munitions into the crowd, and eventually fired several volleys of chemical rounds from pepper ball guns. The last remnants of the crowd departed as police advanced north on Broadway just before 8:30 p.m.
In an advisory issued just after 9 p.m., the Colorado State Patrol warned drivers to avoid downtown Denver because of “large crowds and possible unlawful road closures.”
An expanding deportation program
Tensions have risen in Denver, L.A. and other cities around the country in recent weeks following a series of moves by the Trump administration to expand its mass deportation efforts. In his second term, Trump has vowed to deport all of the estimated 12.2 million people living in the country without permanent legal status.
ICE agents have begun arresting individuals and families outside federal immigration courts, reversing a longstanding policy that avoided such arrests so as not to deter immigrants from going through lawful court proceedings. A series of high-profile raids at restaurants and other workplaces have followed in the wake of Trump adviser Stephen Miller reportedly pressuring the agency to broaden the scope of its enforcement operations.
“Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?” Miller asked ICE leaders on May 20, according to the Washington Examiner.

The Trump administration on Saturday spuriously described recent ICE operations in L.A. as targeting “the worst of the worst,” a claim belied by the agency’s raids of a downtown clothing wholesaler and a Home Depot in an L.A. suburb, both of which drew protests and led to the initial clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement this weekend. Federal agents in tactical gear shot tear gas and flash-bang grenades and arrested dozens of protesters they accused of obstructing the operations, including union leader David Huerta, who was charged by federal prosecutors Monday with a felony count of conspiracy to impede an officer.
The share of people in ICE detention with no criminal record had risen to nearly 25% as of June 1, a sharp uptick from 6% in January, according to the American Immigration Council.

Spencer Cox told reporters on Tuesday he’s “grateful” President Donald Trump has activated the California National Guard and sent Marines to Los Angeles to tamp down on protests — a move Trump made without California Gov.

Spencer Cox speaks during his monthly news conference in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, June 10, 2025. (Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters on Tuesday he’s “grateful” President Donald Trump has activated the California National Guard and sent Marines to Los Angeles to tamp down on protests — a move Trump made without California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s consent. 
“I’m sympathetic to a president who wants to make sure that we’re protecting lives and property and doing everything possible to make that happen,” Cox said during his monthly PBS Utah news conference. 
Newsom and other Democrats have called the deployment of National Guard troops a violation of state sovereignty — with Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta filing a lawsuit Monday challenging it as a violation of states’ rights for not first conferring with the state before mobilizing the National Guard. 
State-federal tensions over ICE rise as Trump deploys troops against Los Angeles protests

Acknowledging that lawsuit, Cox — who leads a Republican-controlled state where leaders often decry federal overreach — said the U.S. Constitution and federal law “clearly states that the federal government does have the ability” to deploy National Guard troops on states. 
“I do think it is legal for the president to do that — whether it’s wise or not,” Cox said. “When things get out of control, somebody has to stop it. And so I’m grateful that we have a president who is willing to act to help stop that.” 
However, Cox also added that “as a states’ rights person” he doesn’t “love that.” 
“I wish the Constitution didn’t say that, and I wish that federal law doesn’t say that, but it does say that,” he said. “And so that always is an option.” 
The real debate, Cox said, is over whether California needed the president to call the troops in. Cox said his take is “they probably do need it.” 
“Again, I’ve seen the videos. The damage that’s being done is unconscionable,” Cox said. “We just can’t have that in a civil society.” 
The protests of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ activity in Los Angeles sparked a weekend of conflict between protesters and federal agents downtown and in nearby Paramount, California. It also ratcheted up fighting between Trump and Newsom, with Trump calling Newsom “grossly incompetent” and saying White House border czar Tom Homan should arrest him. 
Tensions in Los Angeles rose over the weekend as ICE protesters faced off with police officers, who fired dozens of rubber bullet rounds attempting to disperse people in the streets surrounding the 300 North Los Angeles Federal Building. Some clashes turned violent. At least two self-driving vehicles were set on fire near the protest. Videos of protesters throwing rocks at police vehicles quickly spread online. 


On Tuesday, Cox told reporters he has “lots of concerns” about what’s happening in California.
“You’ve seen the videos. You’ve seen what’s happening out there, the riots, the chaos that is ensuing,” Cox said, comparing it to protests that occurred in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked widespread protests, including in Salt Lake City.
Cox said people should be free to protest, but violent acts “should not be happening.” 
The governor also gave a preemptive warning to anyone protesting in Utah. 
“We will not allow that type of rioting to happen here in Utah, here in our capital city or anywhere else, and we’ll be prepared to make sure that doesn’t happen,” he said. 
Cox added that he wants Utah to “be the best place in the United States to protest.” 
“I want to do everything possible to protect the rights of those who want to protest,” he said, noting that Utah has had some recent protests and expects to see more this weekend. “I think that’s wonderful. That’s also part of the Constitution — the ability for people to show up and express their views and do so publicly, the right to assemble.” 
However, the governor said he also wants Utah to be the “worst possible place to riot.” 
“The minute you start to spray paint the Capitol, the second you … implement violence or property destruction, we will arrest you and we will hold you accountable, and we will break up the disturbance that’s happening,” he said.

Among the protests planned in Utah is a “No Kings” rally as part of a national movement to demonstrate against Trump’s multimillion-dollar military parade planned in Washington, D.C. this Saturday, meant to honor the 250th birthday of the Army and Trump’s 79th birthday. 
Cox said Utah leaders will be “over prepared” to quickly quell any protests that turn violent or destructive. 
“Just a word of warning to anybody who is thinking about any type of violence or chaos or property damage or vandalism, it will not happen here and you will be held accountable,” Cox said. “If you want to protest, this is a great place to protest. If you want to (be violent or destructive), go to California.”
Earlier in the day Tuesday, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall also urged for peaceful protest during a Juneteenth flag-raising ceremony at City Hall. She said exercise of free speech is welcome, but “violence and destruction will not be tolerated to any extent in Salt Lake City,” The Salt Lake Tribune reported. 
Mendenhall also echoed comments from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, the outlet reported: “Don’t take the bait of the Trump administration. Protest peacefully.” 
Asked whether he has been contacted by the Trump administration about sending Utah National Guard troops to California or any other state, Cox said, “We haven’t heard from the administration about sending Guard troops anywhere.” 
However, Cox said “we have had conversations” about providing troops for “logistics help” for processing and transporting undocumented immigrants to a holding facility in Nevada, which is the closest one to Utah. 
Cox said Utah troops are not “going hands on, not being a part of anything that ICE is doing,” but “there has been a request for help” from states and their national guards to help process and transport undocumented immigrants. “They can use training hours for some of those types of things as well,” Cox said. “So those are the conversations that are ongoing, but we don’t have any requests for anything else.” 
Pressed on whether Cox would send troops if the Trump administration did ask for the Utah National Guard to be deployed for immigration enforcement in other states, the governor gave a noncommittal answer. 
“We would have to look at the situation and consider what’s happening in other states and if that’s a good use of our resources,” he said.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders as she announces Arkansas' request to exclude soda and candy from SNAP benefits on April 15, 2025. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Candy and sodas are coming off the menu for SNAP recipients in Arkansas, and rotisserie chickens are taking their place.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins officially approved a waiver to allow Arkansas to ban its SNAP recipients from using their benefits to purchase certain types of food on Tuesday. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders made the waiver request to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, when Rollins visited Little Rock in April.
The waiver will take effect July 1, 2026.
Sanders specifically asked the federal government to allow Arkansas to restrict SNAP participants from purchasing certain types of food and drink deemed unhealthy with their benefits, such as soda, juices with less than 50% natural juice and other “unhealthy drinks,” along with “confectionary products with flour and artificially sweetened candy.” 
In their place, Sanders requested that Arkansas SNAP recipients be allowed to purchase rotisserie chickens with their food benefits.
Arkansas asks USDA to exclude soda, candy from state SNAP benefits

In an emailed press release Tuesday, Sanders said the approval “sends a clear message” that Arkansas stands with the Trump administration to tackle the “chronic disease epidemic” in the U.S.
“Arkansas leads the nation in getting unhealthy, ultra-processed foods off food stamps and helping our most vulnerable citizens lead healthier lives,” Sanders said.
The exclusion of soda and candy would not decrease overall SNAP benefits received by beneficiaries, Sanders said during Rollins’ April visit, but would rather free up more of their benefits for healthier foods.
Arkansas was one of the first states to request the junk food waiver. Nebraska was the first to receive approval on May 20.
In a Monday night press release, the USDA said Rollins would host U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and Sanders for “a discussion about President [Donald] Trump’s government wide effort to Make America Healthy Again.” 
“America’s governors have proudly answered the call to innovate by improving nutrition programs, ensuring better choices while respecting the generosity of the American taxpayer,” the Sanders release quoted Rollins as saying.
Since aligning himself with President Donald Trump last year after a failed presidential campaign, Kennedy has continued his criticisms of companies and foods he says contribute to Americans’ poor health. It spawned the broader MAHA movement among conservatives, with GOP governors such as Sanders repeating Kennedy’s warnings of a “chronic disease epidemic” caused by food dyes and ultraprocessed foods. 
Sanders’ waiver request was made as Arkansas legislators considered — and ultimately approved — legislation that requires the Arkansas Department of Human Services, which oversees SNAP in the state, to apply for a junk food waiver over the objections of Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, who said the requirement was a “slippery slope in terms of debating what foods are healthy or not.” 
A better way to address poor health outcomes would be to address root causes such as poverty and access to medical care, Christin Harper, AACF’s policy director told legislators in April.
The food industry pushed back on Sanders’ assertions that their products were driving a health crisis in April, with the National Confectioners Association calling the waiver “misguided.” The NCA argued then that the “candy purchasing patterns” of those who received SNAP benefits and those who didn’t were “basically equivalent.” 
The American Beverage Association also pushed back on the arguments Sanders made in April, saying at the time that granting the waiver “won’t make one ounce of difference on health.”
The waiver decision comes after the USDA backed down on a demand to states that they provide a variety of personally-identifiable information on SNAP beneficiaries while lawsuits played out.

Ron DeSantis, left, and House Speaker Daniel Perez, right. (Photos by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday signed into law priority legislation for House Speaker Daniel Perez that addresses how people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) receive health care.
There were fears in the IDD advocacy community that DeSantis was going to veto the bill but he signed HB 1103 into law without any ceremony or a press conference. He acted three days after receiving it and while the House and Senate met in an extended session to craft the next state budget.
Jim DeBeaugrine, a former Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD) director and now a lobbyist, praised language that requires the agency to make public information about the number of people served in the Medicaid waiver program known as iBudget, plus the number of individuals on the waiting list, broken down by the counties in which they live.

Federal Medicaid law provides coverage for health care services to cure or ameliorate diseases but generally doesn’t cover services that won’t. Specific to IDD, Medicaid covers the costs of institutional care but not of home- and community-based services that, if provided, can help people with IDD live outside of institutions.
Former Gov. Jeb Bush applied for a Medicaid waiver to provide these services to people with IDD. Eligible diagnoses include disorders or syndromes attributable to intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, autism, spina bifida, Down syndrome, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, or Prader-Willi syndrome so long as the disorder manifested itself before the age 18.
But the program is underfunded and has had lengthy waiting lists on which sometimes people have lingered for more than a decade. The Legislature has required APD to provide it with information about the program but while the information was once easily publicly available, the DeSantis administration stopped posting it online.
The bill requires the information to be made public again.
“You know, APD has gotten hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars over the last several years. And I think it’ll help to hold the agency accountable. And it’s good for the public, particularly the advocacy community, to understand what happens with those dollars, how many people we’re funding, whether the dollars are being spent for services,” DeBeaugrine told the Florida Phoenix Tuesday. 
“You know, the rub on all of this is that the agency used to publish that data without the law telling them to. But since they stopped, I believe this is a positive step towards re-establishing accountability and transparency.”
The law also involves a Medicaid managed-care pilot program launched at the behest of then-House Speaker-Designate, now speaker, Perez in 2023. The pilot was designed to care for up to 600 individuals and was approved for Medicaid regions D and I, which serve Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties.
The state received federal approval for the pilot in February 2024. The Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) issued a competitive procurement for the pilot with two vendors, Florida Community Care and Simply Healthcare Plans Inc., vying for the contract. AHCA eventually awarded the contract to Florida Community Care.
Three hundred and fifty eight people were enrolled in the pilot program as of May 5. During testimony before the House Health and Human Services Committee in February, Carol Gormley, vice president for government affairs for Independent Living Systems, attributed the slow start-up to administrative barriers on APD’s part. Independent Living Systems is the parent company of Florida Community Care.
The new law lifts the 600-person cap on the pilot program on Oct. 1, expanding enrollment statewide for qualifying disabled people on the Medicaid iBudget wait list. There are 21,000 plus people on the waitlist, according to a legislative analysis.
In a statement to the Florida Phoenix Tuesday, Gormley lauded DeSantis and the Legislature for their “commitment to expanding and improving services for persons with disabilities.
“We look forward to the opportunity to extend the comprehensive benefits offered through the pilot program to families who choose to participate,” she said.

(State of Alaska image)The federal government may name an Alaska Range mountain after a longtime Talkeetna miner and pioneer woman this week.
On Thursday, the domestic names committee of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names is scheduled to meet in Washington, D.C., to consider proposals for new names. On its agenda is Mount Carola, a mountain between Ruth Glacier and Tokositna Glacier in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough.
The mountain doesn’t currently have a federally registered name, according to U.S. Geological Survey records.
Carola June Young, born in 1936, was a longtime resident of Talkeetna and the rural Matanuska-Susitna Borough. She was a former owner of the Fairview Inn in Talkeetna, one of the founders of the local Veterans of Foreign Wars post, and former president of the Yentna Mining District, which includes Petersville.
After her death in 2018, one of her daughters, Michele Stevens, sought to name the mountain — which overlooks the Cache Creek area, her home for 40 years — in her honor.
The naming is supported by the Talkeetna Historical Society, the Mat-Su planning commission and the Alaska Miners Association, which petitioned the Alaska Historical Commission, the last stop before the national board.
“Carola Young embodies the Alaska spirit and is the kind of legend we can all be proud of,” wrote Deantha Skibinski, executive director of the Alaska Miners Association, “and AMA could not be more proud to endorse naming a mountain after her.”
During its October 2024 meeting, the board voted 6-1 to approve the nomination and submit it for federal approval. 
At the same meeting, the board approved the renaming of Arkose Peak to Souvenir Peak, and it approved the naming of a nearby, unnamed mountain to Arkose Peak, reflecting local use by mountaineers and skiers.
Both peaks, each above 5,000 feet high, are in the Talkeetna Mountains within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough.
Neither of those proposals is on the federal board’s agenda this month, nor is a proposal to rename “Nazi Creek” in the Aleutians. The Alaska Historical Commission approved that latter change in April, but it remains under consideration by the federal board. 
The World War II-era name was chosen as part of a pattern of naming features in a grid starting with different letters of the alphabet, and advocates for the change said the original naming was arbitrary.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ prison oversight board on Tuesday unanimously approved a contract with two architectural engineering firms to design a planned state prison.
The state Board of Corrections gave preliminary approval in May to the $57 million contract with Omaha, Neb.-based HDR and Little Rock-based Cromwell Architects Engineers, but held off formal approval until Tuesday’s special-call meeting because some members had questions.
The Arkansas Legislative Council, which is scheduled to meet June 20, must give final approval.
The contract does not specify where the prison will be built, and board Chairman Benny Magness emphasized the lack of specificity.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her legislative leaders have said the state intends to build a 3,000-bed prison on 815 acres in Franklin County. That decision rankled some lawmakers and local officials who said they hadn’t been consulted on the site choice, and lawmakers opposed to the location helped kill a bill this spring that would have appropriated $750 million toward the proposed prison.
Board member Lee Watson, who had asked for the delay in approval of the design contract, said his concerns had been addressed. He’d wanted to know whether the architects would have the ability “to scale as needed depending on what the Legislature budgets for us,” he said.
In May, he asked whether the contract would allow for the possibility of another location and whether it would allow for construction of the facility in stages.
Luann Salado, project manager for the board’s construction manager, Vanir Construction Management, said in May that the aim is to prepare a design that would “at least let you understand what it would cost to do — what 3,000 beds would look like, and then allow the state to choose how much [it’s] actually going to build based on how much is actually appropriated to use to build. But we have to start somewhere.”
“You absolutely will have to do this in stages. That is the approach,” she said.
The prison board hired Vanir last October, before Sanders announced the state’s purchase of the Franklin County prison site. The board chose the two design firms in April and chose the partnership of Nabholz Construction of Conway and J.E. Dunn Construction of Kansas City, Missouri, as the general contractor for the prison in May.
Watson asked Corrections Department Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown at the May meeting if it would be “kosher within our budgeting process” to pay for the full design. 
Arkansas Legislature concludes 2025 legislative session; conflict over planned prison continues

Brown said the contract will be a “pay as we go” arrangement as long as the total payment remains under an “authority dollar amount.” The contract allows the state to withdraw from it with seven days’ notice.
Some of the local frustration over the 815 acres of Franklin County land for the prison comes from the Indigenous Chickamauga Nation, which has said the project could have a negative impact on its burial sites in the area.
The HDR/Cromwell contract has a clause that states the Board of Corrections will “appropriately adjust” if anything in the project will “materially change,” Corrections Secretary Lindsay Wallace said.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)A GOP challenge to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling on provisional ballots  is dead, after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case Friday.
The high court’s rejection means county boards of elections must count provisional ballots cast by voters who find out their mail-in ballots have been rejected under the state Supreme Court’s decision in October.
The case at issue, Faith Genser et al vs. the Butler County Board of Elections, stemmed from a lawsuit filed after the 2024 primary election by two Butler County voters. They claimed they were disenfranchised when the board refused to count provisional ballots the voters cast on Election Day, after learning their mail ballots were disqualified for missing dates.
The board of elections reasoned that the Pennsylvania Election Code says provisional ballots from voters whose mail-in ballots are “timely received” can’t be counted, even if the voters’ mail-in ballots are rejected.
In its 4-3 decision, the state Supreme Court found the Elections Code requires county elections officials to count provisional ballots if no other ballot is attributable to the voter, and as long as there are no other issues that would disqualify their provisional ballot.
The U.S. Supreme Court did not explain its decision not to hear the appeal. Attorneys for the RNC and Republican Party of Pennsylvania did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“Republicans don’t think every rightful vote should count. We disagree, and now, the Supreme Court has sided with us. Pennsylvanians deserve to have their say in every election – full stop,” Democratic National Committee Chairperson Ken Martin said in a statement.
The case is one of many involving “paperwork errors” on vote-by-mail-ballots, since absentee voting without an excuse became an option in 2019 with the passage of Act 77.
“Every election, thousands of Pennsylvania mail ballots are voided due to common technical mistakes made by voters,” Rich Ting, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said.  “Thanks to Faith Genser and Frank Matis fighting for their right to vote, all Pennsylvania voters who make those mistakes are guaranteed the right to vote by provisional ballot as a failsafe.”
The ACLU of Pennsylvania and the Public Interest Law Center with pro-bono counsel from Dechert LLP represented Genser and Matis in their lawsuit.
“The Supreme Court’s determination not to hear this case means that Pennsylvanians who make a technical mistake with their mail-in ballots will have a way to fix the mistake instead of losing the opportunity to vote,” Ben Geffen, senior attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, said.
In its petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, the GOP argued the state Supreme Court usurped the Pennsylvania Legislature’s authority to set the “times, places and manner” for congressional elections, leaning on a premise known as the “independent state legislature theory.” That theory asserts that the U.S. Constitution reserves the authority to set the times, places and manner of elections exclusively for state legislatures.
In opposition, the DNC and Pennsylvania Democratic Party asserted that the U.S. Supreme Court lacks jurisdiction, because the case falls outside the limited circumstances in which it can review the judgment of a state’s highest court. Such appeals are allowed only when a federal law is in question, a state law is claimed to conflict with federal law or “where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution.”
The decision last week is the second time the U.S. Supreme Court has passed on reviewing the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision. In November it refused to place a stay on enforcement of the ruling days before the presidential election.
The Pennsylvania General Assembly has taken steps to pass amendments to clarify the vote-by-mail law in recent weeks. 
House Bill 1396, sponsored by Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) would give election workers up to a week before Election Day to prepare to count mail-in ballots, a process that has been a bottleneck for election results in parts of the state, and has provided fodder for election deniers. The measure would remedy other ambiguities in Act 77, such as making clear that county election officials must notify voters if their mail ballots are rejected. It passed the House with a 102-101 vote along party lines May 13.

When the governor's new energy affordability legislation came up at the Local Government Advisory Commission on Tuesday, municipal officials said they felt like they had been heard.
The post Municipal leaders cheer Healey energy bill appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS got an earful from residents as energy bills soared this winter, and many of those municipalities echoed and amplified those concerns to state leaders. So when the governor’s new energy affordability legislation came up at the Local Government Advisory Commission on Tuesday, local officials said they felt like they had been heard.
“It’s really nice to see this on a front burner,” Amesbury Mayor Kassandra Gove said. She said her city and others this winter “asked for [the state’s] help and attention, and we are so grateful to see this energy affordability agenda and the legislation filed last month to help tackle these challenges.”
In a push to save ratepayers $10 billion over a decade, Gov. Maura Healey filed legislation (H 4144) last month to eliminate or reduce energy bill charges, make nuts-and-bolts changes to electricity procurement and supply practices, impose reforms to the competitive electric supply industry, and allow Massachusetts to explore new nuclear energy technologies.
The governor’s focus on energy costs comes after a winter that saw energy bills rise sharply, exacerbating chronic cost-of-living pressures for Massachusetts residents and businesses that already pay some of the highest energy prices in the country.
“Municipalities deal with cost challenges just like our residents and businesses do,” Gove said. “And we know we are at a moment where energy costs in particular are causing stress and concern for customers and ratepayers across the commonwealth.”
Healey’s office broadly detailed where it expects to find the at least $10 billion in savings over a 10-year period, identifying “Getting Costs Off Bills” (about $6.9 billion in savings), “Creating Accountability” ($2.5 billion), and “Supporting the Customer” ($900 million) as main buckets of savings. The bill is now before the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, which has not yet announced a hearing for it.
The bill would require the Department of Public Utilities to review and reform all charges on energy bills, and establish a cap on month-to-month bill increases. It would allow Massachusetts to procure energy directly, which would eliminate fees the state pays utilities for entering into those contracts, and also seeks to reduce the value of net metering credits for new and large solar hookups or other facilities that transfer energy back to the grid in exchange for a bill credit.
The governor’s legislation seeks to phase out the Alternative Portfolio Standard program, which incentivizes technologies like natural-gas-fired combined heat and power facilities, fuel cells, biofuels, and heat pumps, by 2028. It also would grant utilities the ability to finance the Mass Save efficiency program, Electric Sector Modernization Plans, storm response, and other programs by issuing rate reduction bonds to securitize costs. 
After Executive Director of Energy Transformation Melissa Lavinson and Undersecretary of Energy Mike Judge walked through the bill, Acton Town Manager John Mangiaratti said he thinks process of linking new energy projects to the grid is an area in need of greater attention to help residents, businesses and municipalities.
“Here in Acton, we have a pretty cool energy coaching program where we have volunteers work with residents and businesses and help them navigate different ways to make clean energy choices in their buildings. We also have had a lot of success with clean energy projects, solar, for example. But the timelines that we’re experiencing continues to be an obstacle that we’d like to try to find a way to overcome,” he said. “When a project that we have planned out takes sometimes a year longer than we thought because of the interconnection delays, it really changes the finances and causes some savings that people, that the city or the town was counting on to not be there, and it disincentivizes communities from wanting to do these types of projects.”
During her rundown of bill details, Lavinson talked about a part of the governor’s legislation that would require utilities to provide “flexible interconnection solutions,” which she said “should help reduce customer costs and timelines to interconnect, and won’t cost any other customers to do that.”
Gove said she and other mayors support the state’s desire to transition towards cleaner energy and emphasized Tuesday that cities and towns “are simultaneously working towards our own individual climate and clean energy goals.” She mentioned her city’s efforts to support electric vehicles, in keeping with its history as home to S.R. Bailey & Company, which built some of the first electric vehicles there from 1905 to 1916.
“We’re grateful for your continued work to review existing policies and charges to lower lower costs for residents on the whole,” she said. “Cities and towns are doing this work of addressing affordability every day, and know that the residents across the common a Commonwealth will appreciate the results of this larger statewide effort.”

(Photo courtesy of CWA Local 7076)Hayley Peterson recalls coming in to work on the morning of May 5 and stepping off the elevator to the third floor of her office and immediately smelling natural gas.
“It just smelled like gas, like crazy, in the building,” she said.
Peterson, an epidemiologist at the New Mexico Department of Health and a union steward with Communications Workers of America Local 7076, works in the Homestead Building, a state government office building in Albuquerque.
She told Source NM her coworkers in nearby cubicles also smelled the gas that day.
“Other people had gone to talk to building staff about it smelling like gas, and they were basically told it’s not possible, and they were just dismissed,” she said in an interview on Tuesday.
At least a dozen workers reported the smell over the next few days, the union said in a news release, but management didn’t try to investigate the smell’s source or secure the workers’ safety.
A frustrated CWA member called New Mexico Gas Company, whose inspectors found six of the building’s 10 furnaces were leaking, the union said.
DOH closed the building for four days starting on May 8 as a result, New Mexico Health Department Communications Director Robert Nott said.
“The New Mexico Department of Health takes these concerns very seriously,” Nott told Source NM in an email. “We value the lives and contributions of all our employees.”
The Health Care Authority issued Source NM a similar statement and said HCA “coordinated closely with the Department of Health to ensure staff safety after a gas leak was reported at the Homestead facility.”
“HCA staff members were removed from the building as a precaution while repairs and safety inspections were completed,” HCA spokesperson Marina Pina said. “We appreciate our team’s patience during this incident, and we remain committed to the safety and well-being of all state employees.”
When workers returned to the Homestead building on May 14 and immediately smelled gas again, the union said management ignored their complaints until May 16 when DOH Human Resources Director HC Hawkins sent an immediate evacuation notice via email.
A leak that had been repaired the first time needed to be repaired again, Nott said. Management sent the workers home a second time that morning, and they returned to work on May 19, he said. HCA confirmed to Source the building was closed May 8, 9,12,13 and 16.
CWA 7076 Executive President Megan Green on June 5 elevated her grievance with the department to Health Secretary Gina DeBlassie.
“Our union is deeply concerned that the New Mexico Department of Health has systematically endangered its workforce through willful negligence, engaged in active retaliation against workers who report safety concerns, provided false or misleading statements to enforcement bodies like OSHA, and fought against the labor rights of your staff,” Green wrote in the grievance. “Hundreds of NMDOH and HCA workers were forced to work in a building with an active gas leak for several days on two separate occasions.”
‘My coworkers and I were being poisoned’
Many workers in the Homestead building did not receive the first evacuation notice, Peterson said, because leadership sent it using an incomplete email listserv. “I had coworkers in my area that only knew to evacuate because I told them,” she said.
According to a survey of 68 workers the union conducted after the first gas leak, 44% of respondents said they received the evacuation notice and other building closure notices. A third said they did not receive the notices and approximately 23% were not sure.
One person who didn’t get the notice was Marcia Carroll, a DOH management analyst who didn’t become aware of it until 40 minutes later.
“I stayed in that building for 40 additional minutes after an evacuation order,” Carroll told Source NM in an emailed statement on Tuesday.
When the building was first closed, the owner contacted a local plumbing company to repair the leaking furnaces, Nott said.

“We have since contracted with DC Environmental Inc. of Albuquerque to conduct an environmental assessment of the building to ensure the safety of the entire facility and its occupants,” Nott said. “We are awaiting DC Environmental Inc’s report.”
Peterson said those are great first steps, but she questions if the outside evaluation will present a complete picture without input from workers impacted by the incidents over the last two months.
“This initial gas leak endangered hundreds of lives in our building,” said Carroll. “When I sit back and think about it, for four days my coworkers and I were being poisoned. Our lives and health [were] jeopardized. Why? Because we were told there was nothing to worry about and multiple calls of concern were ignored.”
Peterson, Carroll and the union say the problems at the Homestead building began earlier in April, when they breathed in toxic chemicals from a maintenance mishap.
Peterson said a maintenance worker sprayed a stain sealer on the ceiling 10 feet away from her, and she and other workers nearby started coughing. She immediately started feeling a headache and nausea, and walked out of the building.
“There’s no way to ventilate the building, because the windows don’t open,” she said.

Carroll, who said she has a scent sensitivity, said it was irresponsible for the department’s lease manager to allow a maintenance worker to spray the chemical during work hours.

“Management did not promptly respond to this health emergency,” she said. “We were not provided any information. None.”
More than a dozen employees experienced symptoms such as vomiting, nausea or aspiration, the union said. Three sought emergency medical attention, Green wrote in her grievance.
“It really wasn’t acknowledged to us by anyone in leadership for a week,” Peterson said.
The union said DOH reported the incident to the state Occupational Health and Safety Bureau, but presented a one-sided and biased report without speaking to any injured workers. Source NM asked the bureau for comment at the end of the day on Tuesday and will update the story as needed.
“NMDOH has refused to provide written notification of the hazards to which workers were exposed, or provide any actionable guidance on how they can be safe from these hazards in the future,” Green wrote.
Peterson said as a health scientist, she thinks it’s inappropriate that DOH never informed its employees what they had been exposed to in the three incidents, because they would have no way of knowing what to say to a doctor if they see one.
“We’re Department of Health and Health Care Authority workers: we work for the health of New Mexicans, and so we want our leadership to also care about our health,” Peterson said.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)About 250 Pennsylvania National Guard soldiers will be deployed to Washington, D.C., to assist with traffic and crowd control during the unprecedented military parade that will coincide with President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.
But, they will not be taking part in the event.
“No Pennsylvania National Guard equipment or personnel are expected to participate in the parade,” Maj. Travis Mueller, public affairs officer for the Pennsylvania National Guard told the Capital-Star on Tuesday. “However, we are sending around 250 soldiers to D.C. to support the D.C. National Guard’s traffic and crowd management mission, similar to the support we typically provide during presidential inaugurations.” 
The June 14 parade is planned to feature tanks and other military vehicles, thousands of soldiers marching in the streets of the nation’s capital and fly-overs by armed forces aircraft.
Mueller referred questions about the cost and funding for the deployment to the U.S. Army public affairs office, which did not immediately respond to an email.
The parade also coincides with a celebration on the National Mall of the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army’s founding. 
It is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. and run along Constitution Avenue NW from 23rd to 15th streets passing the Ellipse and the White House.
The Army says the events throughout the day will cost taxpayers up to $45 million.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)After announcing the committee and search firm set to seek out Iowa State University’s next president, the Iowa Board of Regents heard Tuesday from a former university president and search expert on the process and pitfalls of such an undertaking.
Roderick McDavis, managing principal of AGB Search and former Ohio University president, spoke to board members about best practices when searching for a new university president. The national higher education search firm, based in Washington, D.C., was announced June 9 as the firm selected to assist ISU in finding a replacement for President Wendy Wintersteen, who will retire in January 2026.
The firm has previously worked with each university governed by the regents to find new leaders, McDavis said, adding that he is excited to collaborate with the board, its staff and university members once again.
“We think you have three great public institutions in the state of Iowa, and you folks are unique,” McDavis said. “We’ve worked with a lot of different states across the country, but in Iowa, we think you folks get it right, and I want to commend you as a board for ensuring that you have three high-quality institutions that are run well, and that you have a board that embraces those institutions and supports them in the way that they should be supported.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A former University of Iowa president, Sally Mason, has worked at AGB for nine years and currently serves as a senior executive search consultant, which McDavis said is an honor.
To conduct a presidential search “the right way,” McDavis said, the timeline should stretch across five or six months, and the firm, board and others involved in the search must be on the same page about jobs and expectations. Confidentiality must also be maintained until the proper time, officials said. Mark Braun, the board’s executive director, said finalists’ names will be released when the individuals come to campus for forums.
Before the candidates come into play, McDavis said, the involved parties will create a leadership profile to serve as the search’s “north star.” The profile determines what kind of person is being sought for the position — such as their qualities, skills and qualifications — and describes the position being applied for and the institution itself.
“It serves two purposes,” McDavis said. “One, it lets people know what the qualifications are for the position, but secondly, it’s also a marketing tool. There’s a lot of information there about the institution, about its vision, about where it’s headed. So, it entices people to get interested in the institution, not just because of the position, but because of where that institution is going.”
From there, candidates will apply or be nominated for the position and applicants will be reviewed by members of the search committee, semifinalists will be identified and interviewed, then narrowed down to finalists. The firm will also assist in developing a transition plan for ISU for the period before and after Wintersteen departs, and for a time into the new president’s tenure.
AGB will receive the equivalent of 25% of the appointed president’s initial base salary as payment for its services, as well as the value of any expenses, according to a board news release.
The board also released the list of those included in the presidential search committee — a 12-member group charged with recommending candidates to the board for further consideration. Regent JC Risewick and ISU Faculty Senate President Meghan Gillette will co-chair the committee, which also includes other board members, representatives from ISU undergraduate and graduate student governments, faculty, alumni and more.


Full list of search committee members:

Regent JC Risewick, Iowa Board of Regents
ISU Faculty Senate President Meghan Gillette
Iowa Board of Regents President Pro Tem Greta Rouse
Regent Robert Cramer
Regent Kurt Tjaden
ISU Student Government President Colby Brandt
ISU Graduate and Professional Student Senate President Muhammad Azhan
ISU Professional and Scientific Council President-Elect Jennifer Schroeder
ISU professor Tim Day
ISU professor Patrick Schnable
ISU alum Cara Heiden
ISU alum Roger Underwood



McDavis said it is important for each of the parties involved in the search, from the Board of Regents to the search committee and other consultants, to have well-defined roles laid out early in order to avoid any confusion later in the process. The board’s role is to find a search firm, appoint a search committee chair and members, interview finalists for the position, negotiate a contract and hire the preferred candidate, he said.
“The role of the search committee, which we like to repeat often, is not to make decisions about who the next president will be, but to make recommendations to the board so the board can do its work in terms of selecting the next president of the institution,” McDavis said.
Other committee tasks include helping to develop the leadership profile, approving the search timeline, reviewing candidates and interviewing semifinalists before sending candidates to the board.
The chair of the search committee will be the one to make any statements on its behalf, McDavis said, and a board professional will serve as a point of contact between the board, committee and search consultants, and will handle setting up listening sessions, creating the leadership profile, developing processes for application, setting up a candidate pool, conducting reference checks and more.
Previous searches at other universities have seen problems when people are confused about their responsibilities, McDavis said, or when people try to change or add to the criteria already identified as pointing to a good candidate. When not everyone is in agreement on processes and policies, he said it can cause friction and frustration.
Other problems that McDavis said he’s seen in presidential searches can come from outside influence, including situations in which a politician wants to see a certain candidate move through the ranks, and from the candidates themselves when they wait to disclose concerns about relocating with partners and families.
“As long as everyone stays in their particular lane, searches tend to run very, very well,” McDavis said.

DemasSeveral Republicans in the Michigan House and Senate on Wednesday called for the director and chief deputy director of the Department of State Police to resign.
The call for State Police Director James Grady and Chief Deputy Director Aimee Brimacombe to step down followed a weekend announcement from the Michigan State Police Troopers Association and the Michigan State Police Command Officers Association that said the two groups took a nearly unanimous no-confidence vote against the agency’s leadership.
Calls for their resignations came from Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), who is a Republican candidate for governor, state Sen. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake), who is the chair of the Michigan Republican Party, and state Rep. Mike Mueller (R-Linden).
Department spokesperson Shanon Banner in a statement defended Grady and his leadership team, whom she said “provide unwavering support to department members and are proud of the public safety services delivered every day to the public and our law enforcement partners across the state.”

The no confidence vote follows a year’s worth of discontent between the troopers’ association and their leadership. Troopers filed an ethics complaint against Grady and Brimacombe in January. A handful of troopers also filed lawsuits against Brimacombe questioning her leadership, as well.
Grady was appointed as director of the department following the departure of former director Joseph Gasper.
Nesbitt said the vote of no confidence was a damning indictment on the agency’s current administration.
“It is undeniable that this is the absolute worst leadership our state police has ever seen and completely unacceptable for the troopers and public they serve,” Nesbitt said in a statement released Monday. “There needs to be a change at the top and that change needs to happen immediately. Col. Grady must step down or the governor must relieve him of his duties.”
Runestad questioned how Grady and Brimacombe could continue in their roles after more than 1,000 troopers voted against their leadership.
“It has become alarmingly clear that Col. Grady and Lt. Col. Brimacombe’s failed leadership has disparaged the reputation of the Michigan State Police,” Runestad said in a statement. “I demand they step down immediately and urge the governor to relieve them of their duties if they do not resign voluntarily.”
Mueller, a former law enforcement officer who has been investigating issues with State Police’s leadership and other controversies at the individual post level, said troopers spoke loudly this weekend.

“They have no confidence in the current leadership. It is corrupt, dishonest, and doesn’t keep the best interest of its own troopers in mind,” Mueller said in a scathing statement. “If they have any shame, Grady and Brimacombe should resign right now.”
In response, Banner said it has been a priority for Grady to conduct in-person visits to department worksites to listen to member feedback.
“During these visits, he’s engaged in meaningful conversations, including seeking input from the membership about morale and opportunities for areas of improvement,” Banner said. “Under Colonel Grady’s leadership, the department has continued to invest in better training and professional development opportunities, updated equipment and improved technology. Further, dozens of new troopers joined the ranks last month and this year’s proposed budget includes pay raises for troopers and sergeants.”
Banner added that Grady remains committed to the department and “is focused on moving the department forward while maintaining the department’s proud tradition of service through excellence, integrity and courtesy.”

(Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The special session bills to fund professional sports stadiums in Kansas City and provide disaster relief to St. Louis passed House committees easily on Tuesday, setting up final votes that will send them to Gov. Mike Kehoe.
There were no changes from the Senate-approved versions as the stadium financing bill passed the House Economic Development Committee on an 11-2 vote and a spending bill with $100 million for storm cleanup in St. Louis by a unanimous vote.
As long as there are no amendments passed on the floor, those two bills and another to authorize disaster housing support will be finished Wednesday. If there are any changes, they will have to be approved by the state Senate, which passed all three bills last week.
The immediate purpose of the special session was to get state lawmakers on record with an offer to the NFL’s Kansas City Chiefs and MLB’s Royals before the teams had to make a decision on whether to jump the state line to take a deal offered by Kansas. 
The Kansas offer, with a deadline at the end of the month, is a serious proposal and Missouri will lose the teams — and the economic activity associated with them — if it does not put up a counter-offer, said state Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall.
Under the stadium bill, Missouri would calculate the tax revenue generated by activities in Arrowhead and Kauffman stadiums — home of the Chiefs and Royals, respectively, since the early 1970s — and dedicate the money to bond payments.
“This isn’t using tax dollars off of the income tax that’s collected from someone that’s working at Dollar General or a feed store or a fertilizer shop or a clothing store or wherever,” Gregory said. “This is using the taxes that are generated at the stadiums themselves, off of Joe Burrow when he comes to play in Kansas City, we collect taxes off his paycheck, or when Taylor Swift has a concert at Arrowhead Stadium.”
Backers of the bill estimate that close to $1.5 billion would be spent over 30 years. The money would pay about half the cost of upgrades at Arrowhead and a brand new stadium for the Royals.
Opponents of the plan tried to persuade the committee to wait. The Chiefs and Royals have not accepted the Kansas offer and haven’t promised to stay if Missouri makes a firm financial commitment, said Patrick Tuohey, a senior fellow at the conservative Show-Me Institute.
“This entire special session and this deal is an absolute hustle,” Tuohey said.
The Kansas offer is dependent on investors being willing to buy bonds backed only by the new tax revenue generated in a district around the stadiums, Tuohey said. That won’t be enough money to service the debt, he said.
“This deadline simply means that the Kansas offer ends,” Tuouhey said. “The absolute worst time for Missouri to offer, to make an offer is during that time. You should wait until after the 30th and see if Kansas wants to extend. But the idea that the Chiefs and the Royals are dictating deadlines to the Missouri Legislature is crazy.”
Under the legislation, Missouri would keep money received that exceeds the current tax revenue, Gregory said. And if the teams move, he added, the state loses both.
“We’re not talking just about the potential revenue loss for the team moving across the state lines,” he said. “I think we are talking about jobs and tax revenue coming from a lot of different places across the Kansas City metro area.”
The property tax cap in the legislation would apply to 97 counties, 75 where base bills could not increase more than 5% per year and 22 more where no increase would be allowed. The bill exempts additions to the tax bill for newly voted levies and the additional value of home improvements. 
The bill includes two other major provisions, with the most expensive being a tax credit for people living in areas where a federal disaster declaration has been requested. The credit would be equal to their insurance deductible and available regardless of whether the disaster request is approved. The other provision would renew a tax credit program that supports major amateur sporting events.
The disaster tax credit, only for damage occurring this year, would be capped at $5,000 per person and $90 million total this year. For people who cannot use their full tax credit, the bill would allow them to carry the loss forward for another 29 years and cap the total allowed at $45 million per year.
The provision could eventually cost state taxpayers about $600 million, Dan Haug, state budget director, said in testimony to the House Budget Committee.
“That is what I would call an upper limit,” he said.
In the spending bill, Kehoe initially sought $25 million for housing assistance grants, adding it to the core items he wanted from a construction bill spiked in the House just before a final vote in the regular session. Under pressure from Democratic lawmakers in the Senate — votes vital to passing the stadium package — Kehoe agreed to add $100 million to help St. Louis recover from a devastating tornado that hit May 16.
The bill spends $360 million overall — $175 million of general revenue and $185 million from other funds.
Despite grumbling that many items in the bill spiked during the regular session were badly needed, House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, said nothing would be added.
When Kehoe agreed to the additional money, federal recovery aid for St. Louis was uncertain. That changed Monday when President Donald Trump approved the request for a disaster declaration, making federal help to the state and local governments available as well as aid to individuals with damaged property.
The federal recovery aid is welcome but the state funding should be maintained, Haug said to the budget committee.
“These disasters are so expensive that without federal help, there’s no way we can cover all of this,” Haug said. “We just don’t have the general revenue resources to do that.”
Just in the city of St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer told the committee, the tornado damaged 23,000 homes and affected 48,000 people.
“Many of the homes that are so badly damaged are generational homes,” Spencer said. “These are homes that represent all that many of these families have.”

The demand for gasoline is going down.
That’s the simple explanation from Chris Ryan, the president and chief operating officer of Gevo, on why the company plans to add a sustainable aviation fuel plant to the corn-based ethanol plant it purchased at Richardton in southwest North Dakota.
Ryan said the low-carbon jet fuel won’t come cheap – throwing out a ballpark figure of $500 million for a potential project still years down the road.
Ryan spoke Tuesday in Fargo at the Midwest Agriculture Summit hosted by The Chamber of Fargo, Moorhead and West Fargo.

The Red Trail plant was the first ethanol producer in the country to implement carbon sequestration — capturing carbon dioxide from the plant’s corn fermentation tanks and pumping it into permanent underground storage.
The CO2 sequestration is key in lowering the carbon intensity score of the plant and for sustainable jet fuel production. Low-carbon fuels can fetch a higher price than traditional liquid fuels.
“We could make gasoline, but it’s a diminishing market,” Ryan said. “So jet fuel is a kind of sexy thing to talk about these days.”
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Ryan said there is plenty of room to add a jet fuel plant at the 500-acre Richardton site. He said the plant would add about 50 jobs, about the same number that the ethanol plant employs.
Expanding the ethanol plant also is a possibility, Ryan said.
The company also is considering adding wind turbines at Richardton to provide power and lower the carbon score even further, he said. Even though renewable energy tax credits are a possible target for budget cuts under President Donald Trump, he said wind energy at the site still makes good economic sense.
South Dakota plans discussed
Gevo also has plans for a sustainable aviation fuel plant at Lake Preston in southeast South Dakota.
The future of that plant depends in large part on the five-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project that would take carbon emissions from ethanol plants to western North Dakota for underground storage.
Appellate court upholds decisions favoring Summit over county pipeline ordinances

Ryan said when the South Dakota project was conceived, it did not include carbon capture. But as construction costs soared with the COVID-19 pandemic, he said it became necessary to sign on to the Summit pipeline project. He said the federal tax credits for carbon sequestration would help offset the higher building costs.
The project has stalled as Summit has run into permitting rejections and a new state law banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline projects.
“We really need the pipeline,” Ryan said.
He added that Gevo bought more land than it needed for the project. That is allowing for other projects at the site, benefiting Gevo and the Lake Preston area, he said.
The Summit delays spurred the purchase of Red Trail, which had the advantage of sitting almost on top of an area suitable for underground carbon storage.
“We had to take our destiny into our own hands,” Ryan said, and not be dependent on the Summit pipeline.
He said Gevo can “copy and paste” the engineering work done for the South Dakota site to the Richardton site.
Potential use of carbon for oil recovery acknowledged
While the carbon dioxide from the Richardton plant is being pumped underground, Ryan said Gevo recognizes that it has a potential for use in North Dakota’s oilfields, making oil wells more productive through what is called enhanced oil recovery.
North Dakota leaders have been trumpeting the economic benefits of enhanced oil recovery. 
Ryan said if the oil industry is willing to pay for carbon dioxide to use in enhanced oil recovery, Gevo would sell the CO2 rather than pump it underground.
“We don’t care where the revenue comes from, right? Today, we sequester it for a tax credit, and we can sell carbon credits,” Ryan said. “Or you can sell it to somebody for enhanced oil recovery.”
He said he sees it as another advantage of doing business in North Dakota.
“People in North Dakota get that, they understand the value of that,” Ryan said.

Food assistance programs vary and there’s a lot of them. In Montana, as well as other states, some center on paying back food producers who sell their food at farmers markets to those who qualify for SNAP.
In the Treasure State, it’s called the “Double SNAP Dollar program” and allows those qualifying for food assistance to stretch their benefits further by offering double credit at some locations. Three major programs in this arena are overseen by Farm Connect Montana.
The largest Double SNAP program is used by about 2,000 people who utilize around $200,000 in benefits annually. Shoppers get up to $30 per trip to the farmers market to use as a double benefit. So if a person spends $40 on food at a location where the benefit is accepted, it only counts as $20 to their food assistance. 
That program is available at 51 different locations statewide and the benefit not only includes farmers markets, but some farm stands and Community Supported Agriculture programs around Montana.
The program is federally funded through the Farm Bill, and according to a peer-reviewed article published last month in the Journal of Agriculture, Food Systems, and Community Development, there’s evidence it works in this state.
The Farm Bill has historically been on a five-year cycle and is how the federal government dictates much of the nation’s agriculture policy. Lately, it has been renewed on one-year cycles, and parts of the bill are now being discussed in the oft-mentioned “big beautiful” budget bill being pushed by President Donald Trump.
Splitting up the Farm Bill over a multitude of legislative actions even has some food industry leaders concerned and caused confusion about the future of many American agricultural programs.
These widespread changes, including work from outgoing Trump advisor Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, has caused some hiccups. This included a period where Double SNAP Dollars were frozen by DOGE cuts between February until April, after which the funding was restored in the short term.
“That created a ton of confusion, because we as the state lead, the operators, we also weren’t sure if we would be able to bring that back and have the program this year in the form that it’s in,” said Ian Finch, who helps lead to the program at Farm Connect Montana, who added that right now, “Everything is good.”

Finch said they’re pushing forward and have alternative plans should federal funding be reduced. Grants and support by local governments can be gap fillers, he said. And they’ll have to be — the delay caused by the freeze means a break in federal support for the Farmers Market programs. 
Finch said the organization is telling partners around the state to look at fundraising over the summer to fill the short-term gap in their communities.
The federal money will end in August, Finch said, at which point he hopes Congress and the president will continue it, and make it so that organizations in Montana can reapply.
“The current administration has taken down the opportunity to reapply for funding this year, and we don’t know when or if it’s coming back, but our national partners are indicating to us that we do expect that application to become available again,” Finch said. “In which case we will apply and we could have four to five more years of funding.”
Finch works on all three programs — the main Double SNAP program, one geared toward elderly Montanans and another looking to connect people with heart disease and diabetes to fresh food.
The other two programs are smaller than the flagship Double SNAP, Finch said, and more targeted. The Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program is for people 60 years and older, or 55, if they’re an enrolled tribal member.
That’s a $48 benefit for the summer. It’s utilized by around 1,800 people each year and helps support about 200 different farms, Finch said. 
The final program, called the Montana Produce Prescription Collaborative, is being done in concert with hospitals and clinics around the state, mostly in rural areas. It’s geared towards helping underserved populations. Doctors actually prescribe fresh food, Finch said. That program is about three years old.
“There have been kind of grassroots prescription produce initiatives across the state for probably the last 10 years, and then what we did is we really saw an opportunity to identify all of those grassroots programs, bring them together into a collaborative,” Finch said. “Then we ended up funding all of them for their next cycle of funding.”
The state’s Double SNAP program was the subject of peer-reviewed research, published through the University of Montana. Its findings suggest increased purchasing power contributes to increased interest in a healthier diet, improves food security and helps build community.
“This study adds to the growing body of evidence that nutrition incentive programs provide low-income individuals and families with an opportunity to enhance their diet quality, reducing risk for chronic disease and contributing to long-term well-being,” the study states.
The worry from some in the state, including Montana Farmers Union president Walt Schweitzer, is eventual cuts to SNAP programs will hurt people dependent on food assistance. Farmers could be hurt too, as food assistance is a market some producers have entered.  
Schweitzer is concerned the program could be axed, calling it a direct connection between producers and consumers.
“It’s really unfortunate,” Schweitzer said. “And as far as the continuing resolution that was just passed out of the house, where they cut nearly $300 billion from these food nutrition programs, that’s going to have a huge impact for the consumers that need this, and it’s also going to have a huge impact for producers and losing a big market.”
Farmers Market programs can also spur interest in where someone’s food comes from and build relationships with local producers, Finch said. The study asked for thoughts from participants, who shared something similar.
“I always spend a little time chatting with my favorite vendors—the Russians, the Syrian, and the local farmers and families who now bring some of their meat directly to market,” said one person anonymously quoted in the study. “I like to hear where they are from, and how they got started. Stories like my grandparents who travelled and homesteaded in Central Montana. They are pioneers and innovators.”
Other respondents mentioned how they’re asking farmers about ingredients to make a dish better, as well introductions to wholly new foods.
“Spending Double SNAP starts conversation,” another respondent quoted in the study said.
Trump’s tax bill passed the House and some estimates put the long-term decrease in SNAP at $300 billion. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, those cuts could remove more than 3 million Americans from the program in an average month, as work requirements would expand to those between ages of 55 to 64 as well as those with children aged 7 and up.
According to Feeding America’s “Mind the Meal Gap,” a data set and map tracking hunger, more than 139,000 people in Montana were food insecure in 2023, which is 12.3% of the state’s population. Glacier County had the highest rate at 21%, followed by Roosevelt County at 19% and Liberty County at 17.8%.

(Pool photo by Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune)Attorneys for death row inmate Ralph Menzies have filed an appeal with the Utah Supreme Court, challenging a recent decision that found the 67-year-old convicted killer has dementia, but is still competent enough to be executed. 
The news comes as the Utah Attorney General’s Office says it plans to move forward with Menzies’ firing squad execution, with a hearing set for July 9 to discuss the application for an execution warrant.  
An execution warrant, sometimes called a death warrant, is one of the final steps in the process, where the state authorizes the prison to carry out a death sentence after appeals have been exhausted. It’s not yet clear how the appeal to the Utah Supreme Court will impact the state’s application for an execution warrant.

Menzies was convicted of murder in 1988 after he kidnapped 26-year-old gas station clerk Maurine Hunsaker from her work and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon, where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
Menzies spent decades on death row, and in recent years his health has deteriorated. After falling several times in prison he was diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function, according to court testimony. An MRI exam showed Menzies’ brain tissue is deteriorating, and his balance is fraught, causing him to fall several times each month.
His attorneys say his brain is so damaged that he cannot form a rational understanding of why the state is pursuing the death penalty. The goal of the death penalty — retribution and deterrence — cannot be achieved if Menzies doesn’t really understand why he’s being executed, they argued. 
But attorneys for the state say while Menzies might be suffering from cognitive decline, he doesn’t meet that threshold of incompetence. And Utah’s 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates ultimately agreed in a ruling issued Friday evening. 
Judge says Ralph Menzies does have dementia, but is competent enough to be executed

Menzies’ attorneys told Utah News Dispatch they disagree with the ruling and would file an appeal with the Utah Supreme Court. That was made official on Monday, with his attorneys writing they plan to challenge “the final order finding that despite a proper medical diagnosis of vascular dementia, Mr. Menzies has failed to demonstrate that he is incompetent to be executed.” 
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection and firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced in 1988, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.
The news that Menzies was found competent to be executed was celebrated by Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, who told Utah News Dispatch “my family is very happy to see that we might have some closure coming.”
“We definitely appreciate the fact that it’s moving forward, we are in hopes that the flow can continue and we can get an execution date and the death warrant signed immediately,” Hunsaker said on Friday following Bates’ ruling. 
Menzies’ attorney Lindsey Layer, meanwhile, said she respectfully disagreed with the ruling, calling her client “a severely brain-damaged, wheelchair-bound, 67-year-old man with dementia and significant memory problems.” 
“He cannot understand the State’s reasons for his execution. His dementia is progressive and he is not going to get better. It is deeply troubling that Utah plans to remove Mr. Menzies from his wheelchair and oxygen tank to strap him into an execution chair and shoot him to death,” Layer said.

Jim Clyburn speaks at his annual fish fry on Friday May 30, 2025. (Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC daily Gazette)A decade after nine people were gunned down in a Charleston church, South Carolina’s lone Democrat in Congress is launching another effort to close the loophole that allowed the hate-filled shooter to purchase his gun.
U.S. Rep. James Clyburn, accompanied by a quartet of House Democrats, announced Tuesday the latest proposal to give the FBI longer to complete a background check. Instead of letting a gun sale go through after three business days, the bill would give the FBI up to 20 business days to verify whether a customer checks out.
A longer background check may have prevented the tragedy that shocked the nation June 17, 2015. A drug arrest should’ve prevented then-21-year-old Dylann Roof from buying the gun he used to kill people gathered for a Wednesday night Bible study at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston. But an FBI investigator didn’t determine that in time to stop the sale.
“These were all constituents of mine, some of whom I knew very personally,” Clyburn, whose 6th District includes the historic Black church, said at a news conference in Washington, D.C. “With the kind of background check we are talking about today, we would have prevented that because he would have never gotten a gun.”
The gunman, an avowed white supremacist who wanted to start a race war, “had cased the church. He had researched the church,” Clyburn said one week ahead of the 10-year anniversary. “And he picked this church because of its history.”
A federal jury convicted Roof in December 2016 on 33 counts of federal hate crimes and firearms charges. Weeks later, jurors sentenced him to death. He is among just three inmates left on federal death row after President Joe Biden pardoned 37 other prisoners in December.
SC activists call for expanded gun background checks a decade after Mother Emanuel slaying

In the aftermath of the shooting, the federal law allowing a licensed firearm dealer to continue with a sale after three days — regardless of whether the check has been completed — became known as the Charleston loophole.
State and federal proposals to give the FBI more time have failed repeatedly.
A month after the massacre, FBI Director James Comey outlined the clerical errors and jurisdictional confusion that let the gun sale go through, saying “The bottom line is clear: Dylann Roof should not have been able to legally buy that gun that day.”
At the time, then-Gov. Nikki Haley said that knowledge made her “literally sick to my stomach.” But her response was to criticize the FBI for still relying on paperwork, saying technology, not more time, is the solution.
Pro-gun lobbying groups, including the National Rifle Association, remain staunchly opposed to extending the wait time for background checks, arguing it could put people trying to buy a gun for self-defense in danger. The NRA has also noted that two months lapsed between Roof buying the gun and the shooting. The group contends extending the three-day required wait would not have stopped him.
Nationwide, 22 states have either extended the wait for a background check beyond three days or eliminated the ability for a sale to proceed before a check is complete, no matter how long it takes, according to the gun safety nonprofit Everytown. In the Southeast, those states include Florida, Tennessee and Virginia.
The bill Clyburn announced Tuesday is very similar to legislation that passed the U.S. House in 2019 and 2021, when Democrats controlled the chamber. Neither got a vote on the Senate floor. Legislation he introduced in 2023, after Republicans regained control of the House, never made it out of committee.
At the news conference, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries pleaded for Republicans to support the bill.
“The gun violence epidemic that has ravaged America for far too long in such horrific ways, in such deeply personal ways, in such searing ways, requires an aggressive, commonsense response,” said the New York Democrat, adding, “We just need a handful of Republicans to join us.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5439-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Trump’s military response to the protests and civil unrest in Los Angeles after ICE raids, calling it a deliberate provocation just days before a nationwide day of protests dubbed “No Kings.”
“You have the right to protest. You have the right to protest peacefully. You protest peacefully, you enhance the cause, and people listen to your message,” Gov. Ned Lamont said. “If the protests turn violent, sometimes that’s distracting from your message.”
The state Capitol in Hartford is one if the sites of planned demonstrations billed as “a nationwide day of defiance.” Other protests in Connecticut are planned for Stamford and Farmington. Demonstrations in Washington, D.C., will coincide with a military parade on the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.
“People that want to protest will be met with big force,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, not differentiating between peaceful and violent protest. “But this is people that hate our country. They will be met with heavy force.”
Lamont, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and Attorney General William Tong delivered a far different message, addressing reporters in the lobby of the State Office Building, where Tong has his office.
“Speak out. Do it. Do it peacefully, lawfully. But be passionate. Be loud,” Tong said. “This state has a track record, and our track record is of people, sometimes forcefully and aggressively, exercising their First Amendment rights, but lawfully and peaceably.”
Bysiewicz, who plans on attending the No Kings rallies, said she fielded calls asking if Connecticut planned to deploy National Guard troops on Saturday — something not contemplated, much less planned.
“This is something that is on the minds of people in Connecticut, because there are people all across the state who are planning dozens of these No Kings protests, and they were concerned enough to call me to ask whether the governor was planning to send in the National Guard,” she said.
On websites promoting the rallies, the organizers urge “de-escalation” in the face of any conflict Saturday.
State Capitol police were more than adequate to provide security on April 5, when between 2,500 and 3,000 people turned out to peacefully protest Trump’s upending of the economy, immigration and every corner of federal government in his first two months back in power.
“There are a lot of Twitter entreaties to ramp up the nature of the protests right now. I understand the frustration there is out there. Whatever you do, do it peacefully. We’ll be there to keep you safe,” Lamont said.
Lamont noted that Connecticut experienced a string of acts of civil disobedience, including blocking highways, after the killing of George Floyd. But all were resolved peacefully, he said.
“We are here to make it clear that the state of Connecticut objects to the use of American soldiers against American citizens on American soil in California and Los Angeles under these circumstances,” Tong said.

The case did not seek a ruling on the constitutionality of school districts barring transgender students from sex-designated spaces. Instead, it centered around whether evidence presented in Jackson County Circuit Court was sufficient to rule on the student’s claims of sex discrimination.
In 2021, a Jackson County jury sided with the student, identified by his initials R.M.A. in court proceedings, and awarded him over $4 million in damages. But Circuit Judge Cory Atkins threw out the verdict in a move that is reserved for “a complete absence of probative fact to support the jury’s conclusion.”
The court’s decision, written by Judge Kelly Broniec, affirmed Atkins’s decision. R.M.A. had not proven that he was discriminated against on the basis of male sex but instead shown discrimination based on female genitalia, Broniec wrote.
“Although R.M.A. argues the school district’s consideration of genitalia is inherently sex-related, the only evidence adduced at trial was that the school district’s decisions were based on the fact that R.M.A. had female genitalia,” she wrote in the court’s decision.
R.M.A. amended his birth certificate during his time as a student, and his physician testified in circuit court that he is a male. The only evidence of female genitalia in the case is the original birth certificate the district received when R.M.A. enrolled.
Dissenting opinions from Judges Paul Wilson and Brent Powell say there was too much evidence to allow a judge to overturn a jury’s verdict.
“There was more than enough other evidence from which the jury could find R.M.A.’s male sex was a contributing factor in the district’s discriminatory conduct,” Wilson wrote.
Powell opined that the jury had the “role of deciding what evidence to believe.”
Another piece discussed during the case’s oral arguments in February was whether discrimination based on genitalia constitutes “sex stereotyping.”
“It’s very clear that the plaintiff’s sex was the reason for this discrimination,” R.M.A.’s attorney Alexander Edelman said in February. “In that he was a male who was assigned female at birth and so he differed from other males.”
The majority opinion rejected the argument, arguing that genitalia is intrinsic to biological sex.
“A person’s biological sex… is not a stereotype,” it says.
Wilson rebuts that biological sex is more complicated.
“What the dictionary does not say, what no witness testified to or treatise in evidence states, and what no statute or judicial decision provides, is that a person’s sex is always and only determined by that person’s genitalia,” he wrote.
R.M.A.’s case is not the only Missouri lawsuit addressing transgender students’ use of school bathrooms. In 2023, a Platte County School District student filed a lawsuit, alleging the district’s policy is discriminatory, and the case is ongoing.

At left is Greg Lardy, vice president for agriculture at North Dakota State University. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) WEST FARGO, N.D. — The demand for jet fuel is going up. The demand for gasoline is going down. 
That’s the simple explanation from Chris Ryan, the president and chief operating officer of Gevo, on why the company plans to add a sustainable aviation fuel plant to the corn-based ethanol plant it purchased at Richardton in southwest North Dakota. 
Ryan said the low-carbon jet fuel won’t come cheap – throwing out a ballpark figure of $500 million for a potential project still years down the road. 
Ryan spoke Tuesday in Fargo at the Midwest Agriculture Summit hosted by The Chamber of Fargo, Moorhead and West Fargo.

The Red Trail plant was the first ethanol producer in the country to implement carbon sequestration — capturing carbon dioxide from the plant’s corn fermentation tanks and pumping it into permanent underground storage. 
The CO2 sequestration is key in lowering the carbon intensity score of the plant and for sustainable jet fuel production. Low-carbon fuels can fetch a higher price than traditional liquid fuels. 
“We could make gasoline, but it’s a diminishing market,” Ryan said. “So jet fuel is a kind of sexy thing to talk about these days.”
In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Ryan said there is plenty of room to add a jet fuel plant at the 500-acre Richardton site. He said the plant would add about 50 jobs, about the same number that the ethanol plant employs. 
Expanding the ethanol plant also is a possibility, Ryan said.
The company also is considering adding wind turbines at Richardton to provide power and lower the carbon score even further, he said. Even though renewable energy tax credits are a possible target for budget cuts under President Donald Trump, he said wind energy at the site still makes good economic sense. 
Corn price connection to carbon capture hard to pin down

Gevo also has plans for a sustainable aviation fuel plant at Lake Preston in southeast South Dakota.
The future of that plant depends in large part on the five-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project that would take carbon emissions from ethanol plants to western North Dakota for underground storage. 
Ryan said when the South Dakota project was conceived, it did not include carbon capture. But as construction costs soared with the COVID-19 pandemic, he said it became necessary to sign on to the Summit pipeline project. He said the federal tax credits for carbon sequestration would help offset the higher building costs. 
The project has stalled as Summit has run into permitting challenges and a new state law giving landowners more power in easement negotiations. 
“We really need the pipeline,” Ryan said. 
He added that Gevo bought more land than it needed for the project. That is allowing for other projects at the site, benefiting Gevo and the Lake Preston area, he said. 
The Summit delays spurred the purchase of Red Trail, which had the advantage of sitting almost on top of an area suitable for underground carbon storage.  
“We had to take our destiny into our own hands,” Ryan said, and not be dependent on the Summit pipeline. 
He said Gevo can “copy and paste” the engineering work done for the South Dakota site to the Richardton site.

While the carbon dioxide from the Richardton plant is being pumped underground, Ryan said Gevo recognizes that it has a potential for use in North Dakota’s oilfields, making oil wells more productive through what is called enhanced oil recovery.
North Dakota leaders have been trumpeting the economic benefits of enhanced oil recovery. 
Ryan said if the oil industry is willing to pay for carbon dioxide to use in enhanced oil recovery, Gevo would sell the CO2 rather than pump it underground. 
“We don’t care where the revenue comes from, right? Today, we sequester it for a tax credit, and we can sell carbon credits,” Ryan said. “Or you can sell it to somebody for enhanced oil recovery.” 
He said he sees it as another advantage of doing business in North Dakota. 
“People in North Dakota get that, they understand the value of that,” Ryan said.

But as a federal spending plan that would cut billions of dollars from food assistance makes its way through Congress, Hurd told Michigan lawmakers Tuesday she’s worried that she won’t be able to shield her grandchildren from experiencing the effects.
The federal spending plan, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is a plan endorsed by President Donald Trump to align federal spending with the values of the administration. Amongst other cuts, the plan would eliminate nearly $300 billion in funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides food assistance to 1.5 million Michigan residents, roughly 15% of the state’s population.
“As a parent, you try not to put the stress and the concerns of adulthood on children… so to have to possibly say to my grandchildren, ‘well, we either have to eat or not have a place to live, or we have to eat, but not be able to get those shoes or whatever it is that they need… is very concerning to me,” Hurd told Michigan lawmakers on the state House Housing and Human Services Committee.
Her request to lawmakers and her prayers are for her family and other families to not have to make children have to wonder where their next meal will come from, Hurd told lawmakers.
Food banks and pantries in Michigan have raised concerns with the Trump administration making cuts to food assistance programming, outside of the Big Beautiful Bill, in recent weeks, but the cuts expected in congress’ plan has leaders in Michigan urging federal officials to consider the human impact across states.
Cuts to food assistance will cost Michigan about $900 million, the Michigan State Budget Office said in a memo earlier this month, adding that more than half of SNAP participants are families with children.
Michigan having to take over the cost of SNAP food assistance, which is currently 100% federally funded, presents a “ticking time bomb” for the state, Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), chair of the committee, said. 
SNAP also boosts the state’s economy, Dwayne Haywood, senior deputy director of the Economic Stability Administration in the state health department said.
  Michigan state Sen. Sue Shink (D-Ann Arbor) speaks during a state Senate Housing and Human Services Committee meeting on June 10, 2025. | Photo: Anna Liz Nichols
A significant portion of Michigan’s children and senior citizens rely on SNAP benefits in their household, Haywood said, but ultimately 70% of households receiving benefits have employed individuals. And Michiganders use their SNAP funds locally, at businesses and farmer’s markets totalling $3.6 billion in the state in 2023, he added.
“You can only imagine the cost directed to market. It will be a cost. It will be… devastating [for] farmers,” Haywood said of the agriculture sector, a top industry in Michigan. “That will certainly hurt us as we try to help our residents understand healthy eating…everyone in the community will be greatly impacted.”
Hunger is a powerful motivator and not always for good, Sen. Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) said, remembering her childhood, hearing about how her father’s family in Detroit had struggled to ensure every family member could eat, with some loved ones resorting to illegal activity in order to put food on the table.
“I heard from his cousins who would eat less to make sure that my dad had enough food,” Shink said. “I will tell you, as the daughter of somebody who went through that, who saw the incredible damage that it did to my dad, and who knows the damage that it did to me that I still do carry every day. We don’t want to do that to our people.”
The American Dream shouldn’t just be survival, Melissa Miles, a resident of Hillsdale County told lawmakers. Currently, Miles said she’s a student at Eastern Michigan University, raising an immunocompromised four-year-old as a single mom who relies on SNAP.
Hers is a story of survival, Miles said, as she is attending school to better herself and create a bigger future for her and her child, but it is dependent on her ability to not have to worry where her child’s next meal might come from.
“If my family didn’t have SNAP, I can’t bear to think how much sicker my child would be. I’m here today asking you to think about… Michigan families,” Miles said.

The case concerns two rules published by the federal agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services rule […],"The Quentin Burdick federal courthouse in Fargo, North Dakota. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A North Dakota federal judge has ruled that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cannot force a group of Catholic employers to administer or pay for gender-affirming medical care.
The case concerns two rules published by the federal agencies. The Department of Health and Human Services rule bars businesses that provide federally funded health programs from withholding medical care to someone just because they are transgender. Doing so would violate an anti-discrimination provision of the Affordable Care Act and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the rule states.
The lawsuit also challenged a similar rule published by the EEOC implementing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlaws workplace discrimination for employers with more than 15 employees. The rule holds that such employers cannot refuse to cover medical services to a transgender staff member that they would otherwise cover for other employees.
Federal judge in North Dakota rules in favor of Catholic employers on abortion protections

The Catholic Benefits Association — which represents Catholic employers — filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in North Dakota alleging the rules will force its members to violate their religious beliefs. The association said the rules could require Catholic hospitals to perform gender-affirming surgeries or a Catholic ministry to cover an employee’s hormone replacement therapy, for example. The Catholic church teaches that providing gender-affirming care to transgender people is immoral, the association states in its complaint.
The Department of Health and Human Services and EEOC defended the rules as necessary to protect Americans from gender-based discrimination, and further argued that the policies won’t harm religious exercise because employers can ask for religious exemptions from the rules on a case-by-case basis. U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte found these options insufficient because they do not guarantee exemptions to religious organizations, leaving them “unable to predict their legal exposure.”
Welte in an order last week sided largely with the Catholic Benefits Association. Welte found that the rules violate broad protections for religious exercise established in the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. That act states that the government can only limit religious exercise in service of a “compelling government interest,” and must make every effort to be as minimally restrictive as possible.
Welte said that the Department of Health and Human Services and EEOC rules don’t meet these standards. The policies force Catholic organizations to decide between going against their beliefs and being subject to discrimination investigations and lawsuits, he wrote in the order.
He ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services cannot interpret the Affordable Care Act in a way that requires the Catholic Benefits Association to administer or provide insurance coverage for gender-affirming procedures. He similarly found that the EEOC cannot interpret Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require the association to provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures.
The lawsuit also challenged other protections in the rules related to abortion and fertility treatments, though Welte dismissed those claims.
The Catholic Benefits Association filed the lawsuit as a successor to a previous case it joined with other Catholic groups against the Department of Health and Human Services and the EEOC. Welte also sided with the plaintiffs in that case, though an appellate court in 2022 found the Catholic Benefits Association didn’t have standing to be part of the suit.
In another case involving the Catholic Benefits Association, North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Traynor in April ruled that the association is exempt from provisions in two separate EEOC policies — one meant to shield workers from LGBTQ-based workplace harassment, and another that sought to protect workers’ access to abortion and fertility treatments. 
Other federal judges have since issued rulings vacating parts of both rules nationwide. A federal judge in Texas in May vacated portions of the workplace harassment rule that pertain to sexual harassment and gender identity. Later that month, a federal judge in Louisiana struck down the abortion access protections.
The decisions come as President Donald Trump’s administration is rolling back services and legal protections, including by restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors and implementing a blanket ban on transgender people serving in the military. Trump signed an executive order in January establishing a two-gender policy for the federal government.

North Carolina lawmakers gave final approval Tuesday to a bill cracking down on state immigration enforcement, sending it to Gov. Josh Stein’s desk.
Senate Bill 153 requires state agencies to sign agreements cooperating with U.S. Immigrations Customs Enforcement (ICE). It bars undocumented immigrants from receiving state-funded benefits. And it opens local governments that have declared themselves “sanctuaries” to lawsuits in crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.
Senators gave the bill final approval Tuesday, agreeing with changes by the House after previously passing it along party lines back in March.
“I think the people of North Carolina and the people of this nation want our immigration laws enforced,” Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said Tuesday. “And I think what we have moved forward with are things that will enhance the ability of the federal authorities to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.”
Stein, a Democrat, could veto the legislation. If he does, it would be the first of his term — and set up a narrow vote down the line when Republicans attempt to override it.
Senate Republicans have a solid veto-proof majority, but House Republicans are one vote short. Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has previously touted a “working supermajority,” saying there were several Democrats with whom he believes his caucus could swing for key override votes.
Democrats objected to passage of the bill Tuesday. Sen. Natalie Murdock (D-Chatham) called it “heavy-handed government overreach.”
“This bill really is not about safety,” Murdock said. “It’s about intimidation. It’s about fear-mongering.”
Shortly after the bill’s passage, a group of around 30 protesters in the Senate gallery erupted and left the chamber.
“We will hold you accountable for the harm that you caused,” one woman shouted.
Tuesday’s vote is the latest in a series of Republican-led efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement in North Carolina. And it comes with a national spotlight on deportation efforts by the Trump administration, as federal and state officials battle over jurisdiction in California and troops arrive in Los Angeles amid protests. Trump also visited North Carolina on Tuesday, speaking at Fort Bragg.
“The situation in LA is beyond a protest,” Berger told reporters Tuesday.
Last year’s House Bill 10 required local sheriffs in North Carolina to require with ICE. A separate bill aims to close what Republicans have said are “loopholes” in the law.
That proposal, House Bill 318, also made it to Stein’s desk Tuesday. It passed the Senate, 26-17, over opposition from Democrats, and was swiftly given final approval by House Republicans (66-45).",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P5211878-1536x1152-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A bill that attempted to add a layer of legislative oversight to the governor’s picks for the Port of New Orleans board was officially sunk Monday with Gov. Landry’s veto pen. 
Senate Bill 89 by Sen. Joseph Bouie, D-New Orleans, would have required the Senate to approve the governor’s picks for members of the Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans. The measure received unanimous approval from both chambers of the legislature.
Currently, the governor has sole authority to choose port board members nominated by a coalition of organizations from Orleans, Jefferson and St. Bernard Parish. The nominating organizations are made up of university leaders, trade associations and local chambers of commerce. Members of the board serve for five-year terms.
Landry cited “an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy” as grounds for nixing the bill in his veto message, saying the port board selection process was sufficiently rigorous.
“Appointments are locally driven, carefully vetted, and rooted in industry expertise and community representation,” reads Landry’s veto message. “Adding a Senate confirmation requirement would complicate a system that already includes substantial input, oversight, and structure.” 
The Port Board of Commissioners is made up of four members from New Orleans, three from Jefferson Parish and one from St. Bernard Parish. As the sixth-largest port in the United States, the Port of New Orleans handles shipments of hundreds of cargo types, from consumer goods such as coffee, clothes and food to industrial materials including metals, wood and rubber.

DeSantis’ push to shakeup cancer funding could be in trouble in the House

One House bill would have revised how low-performing schools are classified and how Schools of Hope can be started. HB 1267 passed the House on party lines; however; the Senate never took it up. 
The issue resurfaced in the budget conference on Tuesday when the House proposed to allow charter schools to open inside low-performing public schools. The budget document shared with the public outlining the House’s offer didn’t contain any additional details.
The School of Hope program started in 2017 and allows charter schools to open near persistently low-performing schools. In 2023-2024, there were 51 persistently low-performing schools. The bill would’ve classified more schools as persistently low-performing by changing the definition. 
“The House has been pretty consistent that we want students to have access to the best educational opportunities,” House budget chief Rep. Lawrence McClure told reporters Tuesday.
The two chambers have already agreed to $6 million in nonrecurring funding for Schools of Hope for the state fiscal year 2025-26 budget.

The House agreed to adopt a number of Senate-coveted issues related to nursing homes that were contained in SB 170, including requiring long-term care facilities to conduct patient safety and culture surveys at least once every two years. The Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) would be required to include the results in its nursing home guide.
Additionally, the House agreed with the Senate’s proposal to require nursing home medical directors to obtain designation from the American Medical Director Association or to hold a comparable credential or be in the process of seeking those credentials by Jan. 1, 2026.
The House agreed to the Senate’s proposal to fine nursing homes or headquarters of nursing homes that don’t submit their financial data to AHCA’s financial reporting system. The Senate wants to amend the Medicaid law to include a $10,000 fine per violation. SB 170 was sponsored by Sen. Colleen Burton and was a priority for Senate President Ben Albritton. who fast-tracked it through the chamber, with the Senate passing the bill unanimously on April 9. But the House never considered the proposal.
While the House has agreed to those nursing home-related issues in its conforming bill offer, technically they still aren’t finalized because the Senate hasn’t agreed with the House’s offer. Conforming bills are budget-related bills that change substantive law to reflect spending decisions. Unlike the budget, which remains in effect for the state fiscal year, conforming bills change substantive law and remain in effect until the laws are changed.
With no Medicaid expansion on horizon Florida lawmakers take on scope battles (again)

The House also included in its Tuesday healthcare offer a proposal to expand the duties dental hygienists are allowed to perform. The House wants to amend the dental hygienist licensure laws to allow hygienists who practice under general supervision to use a dental diode laser to reduce or eliminate plaque in spaces between a tooth and the gums. 
Only hygienists who complete a 12-hour in-person course recognized by the Board of Dentistry or the American Dental Association would qualify. House Speaker Daniel Perez has championed giving dental hygienists a larger role in the health care system since he was a freshman. 
After seemingly rejecting the idea during the 2025 session, the House appears to have changed direction and is proposing to open up to other hospitals $127.5 million that has been, until now, dedicated solely to four National Cancer Institute-designated facilities: Moffitt Cancer Center; University of Florida Health Cancer Center; Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine; and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
The House’s  proposal amends the statutory definition of cancer center to include community cancer centers accredited  by the American College of Surgeons as a Comprehensive Community Cancer Program or Integrated Network Cancer Program, to qualify for the funds.
It’s not clear which hospitals would benefit from the change.

Mark Green is growing after his second decision to quit before his term ends in 2026, with one person confirming he will run for the seat.
Tennessee Department of General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps announced Tuesday he will seek the 7th Congressional District seat in the wake of Green’s plan to depart.
“Congressman Green is an American patriot who has served our country on the battlefield and served Tennesseans in the halls of Congress,” Van Epps said in a release. “From one West Point grad to another, I commend Congressman Green for his conservative legacy and his commitment to advancing President Trump’s America First agenda on behalf of Tennessee.”

Van Epps graduated from West Point and served multiple combat deployments as a helicopter pilot with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment based in Clarksville. He continues to serve in the Tennessee Army National Guard. A Nashville resident, he was previously senior vice president of operations at Main Street Health, a rural healthcare company. 
Tennessee state Sen. Bill Powers and state Rep. Jody Barrett, as well as former state Rep. Brandon Ogles, told the Lookout Tuesday they are looking at potential candidacies.
Powers, a Clarksville Republican, said he is “seriously considering” a run for the 7th Congressional District seat after Green announced he will resign from the post once the House votes on President Donald Trump’s budget and domestic policy bill. 
“This is nothing I take lightly and am talking with family and friends as we carefully consider this major decision,” Powers, a second-term senator, said in a text message. “We do need conservative leadership and someone who will support the president’s agenda. I’m prepared to fill that role.”
Barrett, a Dickson Republican, said he has consistently stated that he has no “burning desire to climb any political ladder or get to the next proverbial level” but left the door open for a candidacy amid public support.
“If I were to run for Congress, it would be for the same reasons I decided to run for state representative. My family and I are overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and encouragement from throughout the 7th Congressional District for me to jump into this race, but I have never been one to act impulsively or out of self-interest. We will continue to wait, watch and seek direction as to what is best for the Tennesseans that love living in western Middle Tennessee,” said Barrett, who is in his second House term.
Ogles, who served two terms in the House before opting not to seek re-election, told the Lookout he and his family are praying about a potential run. His cousin, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, represents Tennessee’s 5th Congressional District.
Others being mentioned for the election include Republican state Rep. Gino Bulso of Brentwood, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

Green, chairman of the U.S. Homeland Security Committee, announced in February 2024 he would be leaving the U.S. House but reneged within two weeks. He had been dogged at that point by revelations he and his wife were going through a divorce as she said publicly he started carousing in Washington, D.C., with members of Congress.
Trump selected Green, a graduate of West Point, to serve as secretary of the Army in 2017. But questions about his stances on vaccines and whether former President Barack Obama was a U.S. citizen or a Muslim left him short on support and he withdrew from consideration.
Green said this week he decided to step down from Congress because of a private sector opportunity “too exciting to pass up.”
His vote is expected to be critical in passing Trump’s budget plan because Republicans hold a narrow House majority.
District 7 includes 14 counties in Middle and West Tennessee, with more than half of votes cast coming from Davidson, Montgomery and Williamson Counties. The district was redrawn after the 2020 census and with the inclusion of portions of Nashville, picked up more Democratic territory but is still considered a safe Republican seat by the Cook Political Report, which provides nonpartisan analysis of federal campaigns and elections.

Concerns about gutted health care access come as U.S. Senate Republican leaders work to push through a tax and spending bill that would cut Medicaid by an estimated $625 billion over the next decade.
The poll zeroed in on the 8th Congressional District, which includes the northern Denver metro area and parts of Weld County. In the district, where 1 in 4 residents receive Medicaid benefits, 63% of voters said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who voted to cut Medicaid.

The 8th District is represented by Republican Gabe Evans, who voted in favor of the plan that would reduce federal Medicaid spending when it was brought to the U.S. House of Representatives in May. 
A spokesperson for Evans defended the vote, saying a proposed provision to institute part-time work requirements for some people to retain Medicaid eligibility would make “the program more efficient by cutting out fraud, waste, and abuse.”
“Congressman Gabe Evans has been steadfast in his support of protecting Medicaid for the vulnerable populations it was created to serve — pregnant women, kids, and disabled people,” said spokesperson Delanie Bomar in a statement Tuesday.
Evans, who was elected to the House last year, represents one of the country’s few congressional swing districts. According to the poll, 42% of voters in the district want to see increased federal Medicaid spending, 20% want it to stay about the same and 28% want it to decrease.
Medicaid, the state-federal health care program for lower-income people and some with disabilities, serves more than 70 million U.S. residents.
The poll of 675 registered Colorado voters was conducted by Broomfield-based firm Magellan Strategies on behalf of the nonprofit Healthier Colorado. It has a margin of error of 3.7%.
“Politicians are saying that they want to cut Medicaid to make it better, but the poll shows clearly that voters aren’t buying what they’re selling,” said Jake Williams, CEO of Healthier Colorado. “It shows that there’s real political peril for any candidate who votes to cut Medicaid.”
Bomar pointed to the poll’s findings that many respondents, especially those who are Republicans or unaffiliated, said Medicaid “should only be for U.S. citizens or legal residents, with some calling for stricter eligibility enforcement.”
Immigrants who are in the U.S. unlawfully are not eligible for federal Medicaid benefits, but Colorado and 13 other states provide some state-funded coverage to immigrants lacking permanent legal status. Under the proposed federal cuts, an estimated 7.8 million people, most of them citizens or lawful residents, would lose access to Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Some of the main reasons cited in the poll by respondents who said they have favorable opinions of Medicaid are the benefits it provides to low-income Coloradans, seniors, children, people with disabilities and single parents.
“The poll shows that Medicaid cuts would have devastating effects for both our health and economy here in Colorado,” Williams said. “I also think it shows that Colorado voters aren’t dummies.”

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The leader of Arkansas’ largest healthcare system will step down after seven years for personal and medical reasons, the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences announced Tuesday in a news release.
Dr. Cam Patterson became the university’s chancellor in June 2018. By giving up his position as chancellor and as UAMS Health CEO, he will return to being a faculty member in the university’s cardiology department.
Patterson “is facing medical and personal issues that require more attention than he can give them while serving in the chancellor’s position,” according to UAMS’ news release.
“The work our team has done at UAMS over the last seven-plus years has been the high point of my career,” Patterson said in the release. “We have a lot to be proud of and I’ve been the luckiest guy to be a part of it. I am excited about the opportunity to return to the faculty and engage more deeply in the academic and clinical missions at our institution.”
UAMS System President Jay Silveria praised Patterson’s leadership tenure in the release.
“Leading UAMS is a demanding task, and I appreciate Dr. Patterson’s need to do what he feels is best for himself and his family and for the long-term success of the university,” Silveria said. “His contributions to UAMS came through unusually restrictive times, and he should be celebrated for his efforts to push the institution forward while navigating a challenging environment.”
Patterson “oversaw both challenges and improvement in the university’s economic outlook, despite the myriad issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and other unforeseen variables,” the release states.
One such challenge was a conflict between state and federal mandates regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a mandate in November 2021 for health workers to be fully vaccinated or receive exemptions, with noncompliant facilities at risk of losing federal funding.
The rule directly conflicted with a 2021 Arkansas law that said COVID-19 vaccination “shall not be a condition of education, employment, entry, or services from the state or a state agency or entity” unless lawmakers approved an exception. Patterson sought an exemption and defended this decision before a legislative committee.
Silveria will name an interim UAMS chancellor “in the coming weeks” and start a national search for Patterson’s permanent successor, the news release states.

The prosecution had been seeking a prison term of 30 years to life for Deven Moffitt while his attorney argued during a hearing Tuesday for a lesser amount.

BURLINGTON — A Bennington man accused of killing his ex-girlfriend in 2019, whose murder charge was later dismissed, has been ordered to serve 12½ years in prison on federal drug and firearms charges.
Judge Christina Reiss sentenced 35-year-old Deven Moffitt on Tuesday in federal court in Burlington after listening to arguments from his attorney and the prosecutor.
The federal charges against Moffitt stemmed from an encounter with police in June 2022. That’s when they sought to arrest him in the 2019 death of his former girlfriend, Jessica Hildenbrandt, 43, of Ballston Spa, New York.
Earlier this year, the Bennington County State’s Attorney’s Office formally dismissed a murder charge against Moffitt, who had pleaded not guilty to killing Hildenbrandt, after prosecutors failed to confirm the identity of Hildenbrandt’s remains by the trial’s start date.
The prison term imposed by Reiss was far less than the 30 years to life the prosecution had been seeking, but more than the seven years behind bars sought by the defense.
The judge opened the hearing Tuesday by stating she was not taking into consideration the homicide case that had been brought, and later dropped, against Moffitt. 
“I’m not going to sentence you for a murder that is not before the court,” Reiss said. 
Following a May 2024 trial, a federal jury convicted Moffitt of possessing with intent to distribute fentanyl and cocaine, possessing firearms in a drug trafficking crime and possessing firearms as a felon.

Moffitt was arrested in the murder case after prosecutors said Hildenbrandt’s remains were found near an abandoned gravel pit in Searsburg in 2019. She had been missing for several months, according to court records. In 2020, the Vermont Chief Medical Examiner’s Office had initially identified that the remains belonged to Hildenbrandt.
However, when tests to confirm the identity of the remains were not completed by the start of a scheduled trial earlier this year, Bennington County State’s Attorney Erica Marthage’s office formally dismissed the charge.
Kevin Henry, Moffitt’s defense attorney, agreed Tuesday with Reiss that the homicide case should not be a factor in his client’s sentencing on the federal drug and gun charges. He said Moffitt deserved a right to defend himself against that charge in state court, if it were to ever be refiled.
Marthage did not return requests for comment on Tuesday.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Gilman, the prosecutor in the federal case, said during Tuesday’s sentencing hearing that the state prosecutor intended to refile the murder charge. 
According to charging documents leading to the federal case, Moffitt attempted to flee from officers trying to arrest him in 2022, and a bystander saw him place a bag inside a trash container.
A search of the bag revealed 3,750 bags of suspected fentanyl, “distribution quantities” of crack and powder cocaine, and two loaded handguns, according to the documents.
Gilman urged the judge Tuesday to impose a lengthy prison sentence for Moffitt, citing in part his long criminal record that includes four prior felony convictions. 
“While Moffitt had a challenging upbringing and has struggled with substance abuse, this background only offers context for his crimes and not an excuse,” Gilman wrote in a sentencing memo.
“Through multiple criminal justice interventions, Moffitt has had opportunities to turn around his life; he never has,” Gilman added. “Rather, he continued to commit crimes, arguably of greater severity.”
The prosecutor also wrote that while he was “not seeking to prove up” the murder case, Moffitt’s interactions with Hildenbrandt before her death were “highly concerning.”
“According to the statement Hildenbrandt provided law enforcement, Moffitt threatened her and made her fear for her life,” Gilman wrote in his sentencing filing.
“In addition, based on the facts in the (presentence investigation report), Moffitt appeared to have a significant motive to silence Hildenbrandt so that he would not go back to jail,” Gilman wrote. “In short, Moffitt’s past criminal actions and his history, including his involvement with Hildenbrandt, support a greater sentence.”
Henry, Moffitt’s attorney, asked the judge to hand down a much lesser prison term called for by the prosecutor. 
“There is no dispute that the offense is serious and must be punished with a substantial term of incarceration,” Henry wrote in his sentencing memo. “By any measure, a term of 84 months will reflect the seriousness of the crime, promote respect for the law, serve as a general and specific deterrent, and protect the public.”
Henry wrote about the troubled childhood his client endured as his parents battled their own drug addictions leading to Moffitt spending time in the “abusive” care of others.
“At only 17, without a job, housing, money or any family and friends to turn to, Deven lived on the streets of Burlington and slept in an abandoned van,” Henry wrote. “Deven turned to stealing and robbing college kids so he could eat.”
According to Henry, Moffitt now understands that “only he can control his future” and he wants to live a law-abiding life once released from prison.
“Stated differently,” Henry wrote in the filing, “he knows that he can no longer be the angry young man who simply accepted the fact that at an early age that he was destined for the life he has lived to date.”
Moffitt addressed the judge during Tuesday’s hearing, telling her that he had worked to better himself while behind bars awaiting resolution of the federal case. He said he had taken classes to improve his education and understanding of the law. 
Moffitt told Reiss he hoped to someday become a public defender so he could “help those falsely accused” of crimes. 
Reiss, in handing down her sentence, said the amount of drugs seized from Moffitt when he was arrested was an aggravating factor.
“I’ve never seen that amount of fentanyl at trial,” the judge said, adding: “It’s just a tremendously destructive drug, and you had a ton of it.”

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The Louisiana Legislature has approved a bill targeting out-of-state abortion-inducing drug providers, giving more time to individuals who want to sue someone who performed, attempted to perform or substantially facilitated an abortion. 
The legislation is part of an effort from anti-abortion advocates to crack down on doctors who ship abortion-inducing medication to states where the procedure is illegal. In nearly all instances, abortion has been illegal in Louisiana since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
House Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, easily passed both chambers. She dubbed her proposal the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” though it would apply to all forms of the procedure. It extends the window for abortion lawsuits from three years to five years and allows out-of-state doctors and activists to be sued. 
The bill will become law unless vetoed by Gov. Jeff Landry, which is unlikely. 
Ventrella’s bill has the support of Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is currently prosecuting a case against a New York doctor accused of providing abortion-inducing medication to the mother of a pregnant minor in West Baton Rouge Parish. Gov. Kathy Hochul has refused to extradite the doctor to Louisiana to face charges, citing New York’s shield laws. 
The doctor and the minor’s mother were both indicted. Murrill has alleged the minor was coerced to take the medication, though her mother was not charged with this crime.
Ventrella’s legislation was substantially whittled down throughout the legislative process. In its original state, it would have allowed the “mother of the unborn child,” her parents, the man who impregnated her and his parents as potential plaintiffs. The man would have been unable to sue if the pregnancy was the result of rape, sexual assault or incest. 
The measure also would have allowed the plaintiffs to sue anybody who facilitated the abortion, with this term originally being undefined. It also would have allowed drug manufacturers to be sued. 
The legislation received bipartisan pushback, with multiple lawmakers raising privacy concerns. 
Last year, Louisiana lawmakers classified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances. Both are used in medication abortions but also have other uses, including to stop life-threatening postpartum hemorrhages. Medical professionals opposed the move, warning the designation could make the drugs more difficult to access in time-sensitive medical crises.

Some agricultural industry lobbyists urged a legislative committee to wait and see whether the U.S. Supreme Court takes the case, but others — including law enforcement — testified that they could use precise legal directions. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers step toward bill clarifying corner crossing’s legality appeared first on WyoFile .","Corner-crossing public land users have had their legal access rights repeatedly affirmed, and on Friday, the sheriff of the county where it all started was asked if state statute changes could help his deputies navigate the new legal landscape.  
Carbon County Sheriff Alex Bakken retorted that his officers are acting under the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision upholding corner crossing’s legality, while also being “very, very careful” to ensure that those public land users aren’t contacting or damaging private property. Current deputies are “fairly well versed in this issue,” he said. 
“As time progresses and new deputies [come on board] and this issue becomes more and more prevalent, I think more clarification would be beneficial,” Bakken told members of the Wyoming Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee gathered in Dubois. 
Minutes later, the panel of Wyoming senators and representatives voted in a show of hands to prepare language addressing law enforcement’s desire for more legal clarity. 
The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)
Corner crossing is defined as stepping from one piece of public land to another where the landscape consists of a checkerboard-like pattern with alternating public and private ownership. Corner crossers needn’t touch kitty-corner pieces of private ground, but they necessarily pass through the airspace above it.
The proposition of a bill further cementing the public’s right to access 3 million acres in Wyoming was not without its controversy. 
“This issue is not settled at the federal level,” Wyoming Farm Bureau Federation lobbyist Brett Moline testified in Dubois. “Until it is settled, I don’t think there’s much that we can do.”
Moline’s remark alluded to the prospect that the Supreme Court of the United States might take on the corner-crossing case. That’s considered unlikely — several people said in the meeting. Nevertheless, it’s being sought by lawyers for Fred Eshelman, the wealthy North Carolina pharmaceutical executive who owns Elk Mountain Ranch in Carbon County. Checkerboarded public land next to and throughout the ranch was the site of the showdown that so far has affirmed the public’s right to access that public land.

Wyoming Stock Growers Association lobbyist Jim Magagna also urged lawmakers to wait on SCOTUS before tinkering with state statute. 
“If it is heard by the Supreme Court and upheld, then I think where we will be coming to the Legislature and need your assistance … would be in defining the parameters of it,” Magagna said. “There’s going to be so many things that would need to be addressed from a Wyoming perspective.” 
The longtime lobbyist threw out some suppositions: Could someone invent a ladder that could accommodate a side-by-side or even a pickup truck that could enable motorized corner crossing? 
But other parties encouraged action, translating the 10th Circuit’s decision into clear-cut Wyoming law. 
“Is this complicated? Wildly,” Wyoming Backcountry Hunters and Anglers lobbyist Sabrina King said. “Do we probably need clarification at some point that says, ‘Corner crossing, if you don’t touch the surface of the private land, is not a crime.’ That would be helpful.”
“It’s wild that we have to lay out in statute that not committing a crime is not committing a crime,” she added, “but with the complication of this issue, that may be necessary.” 
Efforts to amend Wyoming law to recognize the federal courts’ corner-crossing decisions have so far fallen short. Democrat Rep. Karlee Provenza, of Laramie, ran a bill during the Legislature’s 2025 general session — prior to the 10th Circuit’s decision — but it went nowhere after being held in the drawer by Republican Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, a Hulett rancher.

Five months later, Provenza is working with legislative staff on the language of a bill that might gain support of the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee, of which she’s a member. 
“It’s a whole lot easier to point to a statute in the green book than it is to say, ‘Here’s this however-many-page court document that tells us that we can do this, this and this,’” Provenza told WyoFile. “If we have it in our state statute, it’s just a lot clearer for law enforcement on the ground. It reduces disputes between law enforcement and landowners who are potentially  trying to [prevent] sportsmen from being able to hunt on their public land.” 
The Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee meets next on Aug. 19 in Casper.

,Source New Mexico,2025-06-10 22:05:45+00:00,Source New Mexico,New Mexico health officials: Measles sample detected in Roswell wastewater testing,Danielle Prokop,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/briefs/new-mexico-health-officials-measles-sample-detected-in-roswell-wastewater-testing/,"New Mexico Department of Health officials say wastewater testing revealed measles in Roswell, indicating more cases may be out there","(Rimma Bondarenko/
Getty Images)New Mexico public health officials on Tuesday announced wastewater testing in Roswell had identified a positive sample for measles.
A state health department news release said the June 3 sample result will not impact the number of cases in the state, which requires a diagnosis and often a laboratory confirmation of a sample taken from a person. 
The sample comes as part of a wastewater testing initiative NMDOH undertook starting in mid-March, conducting weekly wastewater measles testing in Albuquerque/Bernalillo County, Carlsbad, Chaparral, Deming, Las Cruces, Portales, Rincon, Rio Rancho, Roswell, Santa Fe and the South Central treatment plant in Doña Ana County.  
In an interview with Source NM, NMDOH Medical Epidemiologist Dr. Daniel Sosin said the agency is partnering with researchers at Rice University in Houston Texas for that testing.
The wastewater results have limits, and don’t reveal when, where or even how many people might have measles. But they do provide warning. In this case, the positive result from Roswell indicates more cases might be coming in Chaves County, NMDOH says. Chaves County ‘s last measles case was recorded on April 5. As of Tuesday, New Mexico measles infections remain unchanged at 81 cases. 
Sosin said the wastewater testing program augments the department’s strategies for increasing vaccine availability and contract-tracing known cases, and likened the approach to layers of Swiss cheese.
“If you have enough slices, you cover the holes so cases don’t slip through,” Sosin said. “Wastewater is one more layer that helps us monitor for a condition that we don’t expect to see in all parts of the state, but could see and want early recognition for.”
Sosin said measles wastewater testing is better for early detection or asymptomatic spread, and those detections could mean putting area doctors on alert for additional cases.
The major limitation of wastewater surveillance, he said, is the tool is only precise for a general picture and cannot be narrowed further.
“We can’t follow up for contact tracing or notifications to reduce ongoing transmission,” Sosin said. “It’s really more of an indicator that [measles] is there and we should be watching more carefully for it.”
Sosin said the best guidance to the public remains the recommendation to get two doses of the vaccine to prevent contracting and spreading the measles. The state says since Feb. 1, 34,210 New Mexicans have received MMR shots.
Measles symptoms can appear one to three weeks after contact with airborne droplets from an infected person’s coughs or sneezes. They include fever, cough, red eyes usually followed by a spotted red rash spreading from the head to the body. Measles can be spread in days before and after symptoms emerge.

Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) leads a press conference with fellow House Democrats on June 10, 2025 to discuss their education budget plan. | ScreenshotMichigan House appropriators responsible for the state’s school aid fund will meet early Wednesday morning for a meeting announced late Tuesday afternoon – which could signal some progress on the Republican-controlled chamber’s side of the budget.
Meanwhile, House Democrats on Tuesday afternoon held a news conference unveiling their plans for the school aid budget to fund Michigan’s public schools. The move was billed as action in light of inaction from their Republican counterparts.
The House Appropriations Subcommittee on School Aid and Department of Education, chaired by Rep. Tim Kelly (R-Saginaw Township), released a committee notice for its Wednesday morning meeting at around 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, which one Michigan Capitol news reporter noted landed about 30 minutes before House Democrats introduced their plan. The notice has no agenda items listed for the meeting scheduled at 8:40 a.m.
Although Democrats do not control the appropriations process in the House, that didn’t stop the caucus from unveiling its plans for the school aid fund on Tuesday.

— MI House Democrats (@MIHouseDems) June 10, 2025

The plan would continue to fund ongoing investment priorities, like universal school meals, special education, funding for at-risk students, mental health and school safety and school district transportation costs. The Great Start Readiness program would be a priority, as well as funding for isolated or rural school districts, bilingual education, career and technical education and Early On programming.
A per-pupil funding increase would also be a part of any Democratic school funding plan advanced to their Republican colleagues.
State Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) said reports of Michigan’s struggling students and schools means that the state, now more than ever, needs a clear and sustained plan for public education.
“Not only are we proposing a $24 billion top-line proposal funding school aid, but we are also increasing the per-pupil allotment to $11,500,” Farhat said Tuesday. “We’re calling on our Republican colleagues to also join us in codifying the categoricals that mean most to our districts. That means at-risk funding, that means school lunch, and that means the hard-fought wins we delivered for parents and teachers over the last two years.”
Aside from the per-pupil funding, Farhat said Democrats are proposing $500 million in classroom size reduction efforts, $300 million for literacy interventions, another $300 million for mental health and over $1 billion in school infrastructure grants.
Farhat said Democrats’ plan would prioritize those items all without raiding school lunches or at risk funding.

House members on both sides of the aisle felt so strongly about the issue, they passed the bill 113-0 last month.
But when the bill (‘Prevent the Sexual Exploitation of Women and Minors Act’) moved to the upper chamber, Senator Buck Newton (R- Greene,  Wayne,  Wilson) saw an opportunity to rework the legislation. Newton’s proposed committee substitute for HB 805, spells out there are only two sexes – male and female – and that gender identity shall not be treated as legally equivalent to biological sex.
  Senator Buck Newton addresses members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on June 10, 2025. (Screengrab from NCGA stream)
“This section ensures that our state follows federal policy and aligns with President Trump’s executive order,” Newton told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday. “This ensures our state maintains eligibility for any and all federal funding.”
Newton’s proposal would ban the use of state funds for transgender surgeries for any prisoner incarcerated in the state prison system.
The final section of Newton’s PCS would require that when a person changes their sex on a birth certificate, the State Registrar must attach the new certificate to the original certificate of birth on file, preserving both copies. The state would also forward a copy of the new certificate to the register of deeds in the county of birth where both would be kept on file.
“What problem are we really trying to solve in terms of efficiency or cost savings?” asked Senator Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham).
“Well, there seems to be a great deal of confusion among our society about the fluidity of sex,” replied Newton. “And it is time that we clarify, once and for all, what most people recognize would be obvious, which is that there are only two sexes.”
“I actually don’t understand why this chamber is so obsessed with genitalia, but here we are,” said Sen. Sydney Batch (D-Wake) noting the new PCS does not allow for a definition that’s based in science.
Batch said the original House bill intended to safeguard women and children from exploitation by the pornography industry was a “fantastic bill” and that Newton’s proposal  should be a standalone bill judged on its own merits.
Senator Mujtaba Mohammed (D-Mecklenburg) questioned why the bill which once enjoyed unanimous support seeks to bar gender affirming care in the prison system.
“We reached out to our state agencies, and they confirmed that they’ve never authorized sexual procedures, there’s never been gender affirming care, there’s never been any authorized gender affirming surgeries,” Mohammed said. “As a Republican, supporting limited government, why are we coming up with unnecessary laws?”
Newton acknowledged while such medical surgeries had not happened yet using North Carolina funds, he believes taxpayers would appreciate that state funds will not be spent in this manner.
“We draw the line now, before anybody attempts to do such a thing.”
  Reighlah Collins, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina (Screengrab from NCGA stream)
Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) said Newton’s proposal reminded her of the hurricane Helene recovery bill – a clean bill that passed the House only to be muddied and politicized when it moved to the Senate.
“The idea that we’re going to put into law that you cannot be transgendered, or that you cannot be all the things that you are railing against is a fool’s errand,” said Grafstein.
Reighlah Collins, Policy Counsel for the ACLU of North Carolina, said the PCS enforces rigid definitions of sex and gender, while forcibly outing people who change their sex on their birth certificate.
“These attempts are part of a larger strategy to push transgender people out of public life,” said Collins.
Sen. Batch said she’d like to see the Judiciary Committee vote on the original House bill, setting aside Newton’s additions.
Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg), a primary sponsor of the bill in the House, appealed to the Senate Judiciary Committee to remember the original intent of the bipartisan legislation.
  Rep. Laura Budd (D-Mecklenburg)
“If you are the victim of human trafficking and there are images or videos of you online there is no remedy in the state of North Carolina to have those images or videos removed from the internet, which means that you’re stuck,” said Budd.
Budd said House Bill 805 was a long time coming and is an important tool to help women who’ve been taken advantage of to have these images removed and the videos taken down.
Budd requested that Newton remove his proposal and find another avenue to advance his PCS.
“When we take this bill and we layer it with those things [in the PCS] we’re not doing good for people with Carolina. We are imposing onto the bill things that are going to make it become the political football,” said Budd.
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee adjourned Tuesday before voting on the matter.  The bill is back on the agenda for Wednesday afternoon.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Batch.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Scheppelman, of Bayfield, said Hurd “tricked and lied to CD3 voters last year” and has since “exposed himself as just another liberal elitist who is dead set against President (Donald) Trump and the millions of MAGA citizens like me” in a press release announcing her candidacy.
She is a U.S. Navy veteran and former health care professional and business owner.

Hurd, a Grand Junction Republican who started his first term in Congress in January, won voters in the district by promising “a different style” from his predecessor, U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Windsor Republican and MAGA provocateur who moved districts after she was reelected by under 600 votes in 2022 and now represents the 4th Congressional District. Hurd has been one of the more moderate Republicans in Congress since he took office.
“When the people of CD3 learn what Jeff Hurd has really been up to in D.C., I know they will choose a real conservative who will fight for them and our real-world local interests, not the sold-out liberal elitists in BOTH parties who are thrilled with Hurd’s betrayal of our common sense values,” Scheppelman said.
The press release announcing Scheppelman’s run said Hurd earned a primary from the MAGA wing of Colorado’s GOP. She was vice chair of the Colorado Republican Party under former chair Dave Williams, who broke party norms by endorsing candidates in primary elections across the state, favoring many MAGA Republicans who lost their races. A group of Republicans attempted to oust Williams and other party leaders, but that effort was halted by the courts. Party members voted Scheppelman out as vice chair after one term in the position.
If elected to Congress, Scheppelman’s campaign website says she would prioritize ending the fentanyl crisis and securing the border; defending agriculture, water rights and landowners; improving rural health care, Medicare and Medicaid; restoring American energy independence; empowering parents and reforming education; defending constitutional rights and “Western values”; honoring and supporting veterans; and strengthening rural economies and small business growth. 
The 3rd District encompasses the Western Slope and the southwest corner of the state, sweeping east to include Pueblo, Otero and Las Animas counties. 
Hurd has already raised over $700,000 for his reelection campaign. Two Democrats, Alex Kelloff and Kyle Doster, have also filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission declaring their run for the seat in the Democratic primary. 
Party primary elections in Colorado will take place in June 2026.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The estimated cost to repair two Kentucky courthouses following April floods is about $11 million, an Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) official told lawmakers Tuesday. 
Danny Rhoades, the AOC executive officer, told members of the Interim Joint Committee on Judiciary that insurance claims are still being filed to fix issues at the Hardin County and Franklin County courthouses. However, the state may need to pay to address lingering issues. 
Flooding inundates Kentucky communities as Frankfort expects a record river crest

Rhoades did note that the insurance coverage for the Franklin County Courthouse is about $1 million. Officials are also waiting to see if the Federal Emergency Management Agency can cover some costs or reimbursements of courthouse repairs, but no federal emergency declaration has been issued for public facilities at this time. 
“But we have to get these back up and operational and repaired as quickly as possible. So the court will need your all’s help,” Rhoades said to the committee. 
In addition to the Franklin and Hardin county buildings, the Perry County Hall of Justice also suffered some damage from early April floods. Wind damaged some roof panels on the Perry County building and some water entered the building, but that was quickly repaired, Rhoades said. 
Since it was built about 28 years ago, the Hardin County Justice Center had never flooded until April, Rhoades said. The building had 18 inches of water in its basement, which housed court records and some electrical equipment. Court operations in Hardin County were suspended while electrical, HVAC and plumbing systems were evaluated and the water receded.
However, Franklin County Courthouse operations must still be conducted offsite due to flooding in the lowest level of the building. Last week, the Franklin circuit clerk’s office, as well as some in-person proceedings for the circuit and district court, moved to the Administrative Office of the Courts’ campus at 1001 Vandalay Drive in Frankfort. The building was previously a Home Depot store. For a few weeks, the court had in-person proceedings in the Court of Appeals chambers on Chamberlin Avenue. Some proceedings for people in custody have taken place at the Frankfort Regional Jail.

During April, water reached four feet on the first floor of the Franklin courthouse. That’s where the circuit clerk offices, security office, specialty courtrooms and holding cells are. Also, the building’s mechanical and electrical systems were damaged by water. Rhoades said it took a week for water to be pumped out of the building.
Judge Thomas Wingate, the chief circuit judge for Franklin County, also appeared before the committee and detailed how staff members moved court records throughout the night and early morning to save them from flood water, adding that he could not help much because of a recent back surgery.
“It actually started coming in about — I don’t know — it was like 10 o’clock in the morning,” Wingate told lawmakers. “By 11, I ordered everybody out. I thought someone was going to get electrocuted. It was coming in that quick.”
Wingate said that as a circuit judge, most of his caseload has not been affected. The courthouse and jail have reverted to some COVID-era protocols, meaning court can be held virtually over Zoom meetings.

“As you all know, since sometimes you all are in my court, it’s Monday and Wednesday at nine, I just do it from my living room,” Wingate said. 
As Franklin County is home to Kentucky’s capital city, most court cases involving state officials or government are filed in the local circuit court. 
An Administrative Office of the Courts spokesperson recently told the Kentucky Lantern that full restoration of the Franklin County Courthouse may take over a year. The agency has hired an architect to develop options for restoration or renovation, but has not yet chosen a construction company. 
Rhoades said repairing electrical panels within the Franklin County Courthouse should be completed within the next couple of weeks. Then, the HVAC and plumbing systems will be evaluated for damage. An alternative space for the circuit clerk’s office will need to be elsewhere in the building once systems are reestablished. 
“I will say that this is a major, major catastrophic flooding event that we basically are having a lot of expenses accumulate on,” Rhoades said. 
A piece of legislation passed earlier this year included a restricted funds carry-forward balance for the Courts of Justice, Rhoades said. However, the courts will need authorization from the legislature to use the funds available for repairs.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1388-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Screenshot) Former state Sen. Cindy Coyne is looking to return to the Rhode Island State House, not as a lawmaker but as lieutenant governor.
Coyne, 63, on Tuesday announced her 2026 campaign for the state’s second-highest executive office, a seat currently held by Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos, a Providence Democrat. 
“My work has been about bringing people together,” Coyne wrote in her announcement. “Listening to people. Seeking the truth and solving problems. That’s what government should be about and that’s what I’ll do as your next Lieutenant Governor.”    
The Barrington Democrat was first elected to her Rhode Island Senate’s District 32 seat in 2014. Coyne beat Republican challenger Giovanni Cicione to fill the seat left vacant by Republican Sen. David Bates, who held the seat for 22 years but decided not to seek reelection. Coyne served through 2022, then decided not to run again. The District 32 seat is now filled by Democrat Pam Lauria, also a Barrington resident. The district spans Barrington and parts of Bristol and East Providence. 
Accompanying Coyne’s campaign announcement included a website and a one-minute, 41-second video recapping her achievements in state politics and her career as a Rhode Island State Trooper. 
Coyne is the first challenger to officially enter the ring against Matos, who was elected for a full term in 2022 following her 2021 appointment to the role by Gov. Dan McKee. McKee served as lieutenant governor for Gina Raimondo, who resigned to go work for the Biden administration.
“I expect there to be a lot of political announcements in the 18 months between now and the election, but I remain focused on my job and serving the people of Rhode Island by lowering the cost of groceries, protecting our small businesses and caring for our seniors,” Matos said in a statement Tuesday.
Coyne chaired the Senate Committee on Judiciary, among the chamber’s most powerful roles. She led successful legislation to disarm people convicted of domestic abuse and sponsored bans on ghost guns as well as a 10-round limit on magazines. In 2017, she sponsored legislation which defined state penalties regarding human trafficking, and the bill later became law. Alongside Rep. Teresa Tanzi, Coyne introduced legislation to raise the state’s smoking age to 21, which eventually became law in 2021.
A 2016 bill sponsored by Coyne led to the creation of child fatality reporting mandates for the state’s youth welfare agency. 
The Pawtucket born and raised Coyne was one of the first women to graduate from the Rhode Island State Police Training Academy and worked with the State Police from 1985 to 2006, rising from a trooper to the rank of lieutenant. She attended the 10-week training program at the FBI National Academy in 1990.
She served on the Barrington Town Council from 2010 to 2014, voting to support a successful ban on plastic bags in the town. Barrington was one of the first municipalities in New England to support such a ban. 
Coyne was the council’s liaison to the town’s Senior Services Advisory Board and took special interest in issues affecting elderly people and seniors as a state senator. She led the 2019 legislation that established a 13-member advisory committee on how the state funds, researches and provides guidance for Alzheimer’s disease — a bill prompted by Coyne’s own father, who died from Alzheimer’s.    
That 13-member commission remains a component of the state’s Alzheimer’s care strategizing, according to a 2024 report from the state health department and the office of current Lt. Gov. Matos. 
Coyne earned a swimming scholarship to attend the University of Rhode Island, graduating in 1983 with a bachelor’s in political science and economics. Six years later, Coyne earned a Bachelor’s of Science in administration of justice from Roger Williams University.   
The statewide primary is set for Tuesday, September 8, 2026.

(Photo by Amanda Mustard for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star).The state House is inching closer to passing a bill to raise the minimum wage in Pennsylvania, an outcome long sought by Democrats and opposed by Republicans.
House Bill 1549 would increase it to $15 per hour for most Pennsylvanians, though in some smaller counties, it would only raise it to $12. 
The proposal would also raise the minimum wage for tipped workers.
“We are falling far, far, far behind,” Rep. Jason Dawkins (D-Philadelphia), the bill’s sponsor said when it was debated in committee last week. “Given our economic uncertainty, I think it’s our duty as elected members to give [to] families across this commonwealth who have struggled to afford basic necessities.”
The commonwealth’s current minimum wage matches the federal rate at $7.25. It has not increased since 2008, and remains lower than those in surrounding states – New York, Ohio, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware.
The timeline laid out in the bill for the proposed minimum wage, as well as the ultimate figure, would vary county by county.
For employers in Philadelphia County, the minimum wage would be $15 on January 1, 2026. 
Elsewhere, the minimum wage would increase gradually, reaching $15 or $12 on January 1, 2028. The difference is based on population. Counties with under 210,000 people, with the exception of Centre, Pike and Monroe Counties, will only see their minimum wage rise to $12.
Beginning in 2029, the minimum wage would increase annually, based on federal cost of living statistics.
On the floor Tuesday, Rep. Seth Grove (R-York), criticized the bill, calling its county-based tier system a “dumb idea.”
“I look at York right next to Adams County. We’re gonna have two different rates for those two now,” Grove said. “How do businesses operate under such draconian policies? How is anyone supposed to figure this out?”
Democrats, however, have long pushed for an increase to Pennsylvania’s minimum wage, with most Republicans opposing it.
Gov. Josh Shapiro, however, has long endorsed a minimum wage hike. On Monday, he posted on social media that the current minimum wage is “too damn low.”
“It’s time to put more money back in Pennsylvanian’s pockets and raise the minimum wage,” he wrote.
The bill would also raise the minimum wage for tipped workers from the current $2.83 per hour to 60% of the minimum wage. That would be $9 where the minimum wage is $15 and $7.20 where it’s $12.
House Bill 1549 must still be voted on one more time on the state House floor before it can pass. It will also have to earn support in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Across the country, some Republicans are calling for a hike in minimum wage. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) introduced a bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday that would raise the minimum wage everywhere in the U.S. to $15.

CHICAGO — Federal prosecutors on Tuesday announced they intend to retry state Sen. Emil Jones III after his April trial on charges of bribery and lying to the FBI ended in a hung jury.

Jones, a Chicago Democrat and son of former Illinois Senate President Emil Jones Jr., stands accused of agreeing to take bribes from red-light camera entrepreneur-turned-government cooperator Omar Maani in 2019, then lying to FBI agents about it.

A jury earlier this spring deadlocked in their deliberations over the three counts and after 23 hours of behind-closed-doors debate, Judge Andrea Wood declared a mistrial. Back in her courtroom nearly seven weeks later, Assistant U.S. Attorney Prashant Kolluri told Wood “the government would like to retry the case.”

Scheduling a retrial won’t happen until next week, however, and Kolluri noted that given the three-week length of Jones’ original trial, the judge may want to consider blocking off four weeks for the new trial “because there may be a few additional witnesses.”

The government called five witnesses in April, including Maani, who testified that he’d met with Jones for three separate dinners in the summer of 2019 at the FBI’s direction. Maani offered a campaign contribution to the senator in the same conversation he asked about Jones’ willingness to drop or modify legislation that called for a statewide study of red-light camera systems in Illinois. Maani testified he worried a study could be a “prelude to a ban” on his industry.

But Jones was more interested in Maani hiring his former intern, Christopher Katz.

“If you can raise me five grand, that’d be good,” Jones said on a secret video recording of his dinner with Maani on July 17, 2019, after Maani pushed him to come up with a number for the proposed campaign donation. “But most importantly, I have an intern working in my office and I’m trying to find him another job, another part-time job while he’s in school. … Do you all have any positions available?”

Prosecutors also called Katz to the witness stand, along with a pair of federal agents who questioned Jones about Maani in September 2019. But the jury could neither agree on whether Jones lied to the agents, nor whether Jones agreed to bribes in the form of a job for Katz or the campaign contribution — money that Maani never actually paid the senator.

During trial, Jones also made the risky decision to testify in his own defense. Jones told the jury that he was trying to avoid taking money from Maani, saying he gave off the vibe of a “used car salesman” and that he was aware Maani was trying to bribe him. But he also contradicted testimony from Katz, who downplayed his relationship with the senator, while Jones said they were close.

After Jones’ trial ended, the five-term senator returned to Springfield for the final weeks of the General Assembly’s spring legislative session; prior to his time in court, Jones hadn’t been to the Capitol since January’s lame duck session and inauguration activities.

Jones was originally indicted in September 2022 but went on to win another term in the Illinois Senate six weeks later, running unopposed. But he’s up for another four-year term in next year’s election cycle and will have to decide this summer whether he’ll circulate petitions in the fall to get on the March 2026 primary ballot while still under indictment or step away from politics.

Jones did not attend Tuesday’s hearing, but his attorneys indicated he’d need to be present for next week’s appearance to discuss a retrial schedule.

Madigan sentencing

Meanwhile on Tuesday, former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan appeared at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse for the second time this week ahead of his Friday afternoon sentencing.

Madigan, who for decades was one of the most powerful politicians in Illinois, was convicted in February on 10 of 23 counts after a four-month corruption trial.

Prosecutors accused Madigan of using his positions of power — including as House speaker, head of the state’s Democratic Party and as partner in a real estate law firm — to benefit himself and those close to him. While the jury couldn’t agree on an overarching racketeering charge, the former speaker was convicted on charges related to alleged bribes involving electric utility Commonwealth Edison and former Chicago Ald. Danny Solis, who unbeknownst to Madigan, was acting as an FBI cooperator.

In dueling filings late last month, the feds asked Judge John Blakey to sentence Madigan to 12 ½ years in prison, while Madigan’s attorneys asked for five years’ probation, including one on home detention. In a brief hearing Monday, Blakey denied Madigan’s motion for a new trial.

Prosecutors also called for a $1.5 million fine, and in a filing last week, revealed Madigan has a net worth of $40 million — the first time that figure has ever been made public. The former speaker’s lawyers on Tuesday successfully argued for Madigan’s net worth to be stricken from the record, although defense attorney Dan Collins acknowledged it “seems a little hollow considering it has already been widely distributed.”

Madigan’s sentencing hearing technically commenced Tuesday as attorneys argued over sentencing guidelines, and whether to take into account trial testimony from a ComEd executive who estimated legislation passed by the General Assembly in 2011 was worth $400 million in additional shareholder value. Blakey will rule on that Friday when Madigan returns for his full sentencing hearing.

,DC,2025-06-10 21:41:01+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Pentagon sets price tag for 60-day Los Angeles troop deployment at $134 million,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-sets-price-tag-60-day-los-angeles-troop-deployment-134-million,,"The Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles will cost the federal government about $134 million, a Pentagon budget official said Tuesday, as the response to the protests further divided officials in California and Washington, D.C.The situation in the country’s second-largest city captured the attention of lawmakers in the nation’s capital, even as the Republican-led Congress charted a path forward for the Trump-backed tax and spending cut bill.Democrats in Congress on Tuesday warned the administration’s actions bordered on authoritarianism, while President Donald Trump said his intervention saved the city from destruction.“If we didn’t send in the National Guard quickly, right now, Los Angeles would be burning to the ground,” Trump said in the Oval Office Tuesday.California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, sought a restraining order blocking the 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines deployed to Los Angeles from assisting with domestic law enforcement. Trump ordered the troops to the city over Newsom’s and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass’ objections.Budget questionDemocrats on Capitol Hill criticized the administration over several aspects of the deployment, saying Trump was instigating violence, overstepping his authority and wasting taxpayer money.At a previously scheduled Appropriations Defense Subcommittee hearing, Democratic Reps. Betty McCollum of Minnesota and Pete Aguillar of California asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth the financial cost of placing 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines in Los Angeles.Hegseth, who is originally from Minnesota, declined to answer McCollum’s question directly, instead invoking the riots in Minneapolis following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020 and saying Trump sought to avoid similar chaos in Los Angeles.“President Trump recognizes a situation like that, improperly handled by a governor, like it was by Gov. (Tim) Walz, if it gets out of control, it's a bad situation for the citizens of any location,” he said.When Aguillar asked a similar question about cost, Hegseth deferred to acting Pentagon comptroller Bryn MacDonnell, who estimated the current cost at $134 million, mainly for housing, travel and food. That money came out of existing operations and maintenance accounts, she said.Hegseth told the panel the deployment was authorized for 60 days.Just 2 miles away at the White House, though, Trump implied the decision could be more open-ended, saying during the Oval Office event that troops would stay in Los Angeles “until there’s no danger.”“When there’s no danger, they’ll leave,” he said.Restraining orderCalifornia’s federal lawsuit challenging the deployment, which state leaders filed Monday, includes a request for the court to issue a restraining order by 1 p.m. Pacific time Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer did not issue such an order by that deadline.The administration intended to use the military personnel “to accompany federal immigration enforcement officers on raids throughout Los Angeles,” the request for a restraining order said.“These unlawful deployments have already proven to be a deeply inflammatory and unnecessary provocation, anathema to our laws limiting the use (of) federal forces for law enforcement, rather than a means of restoring calm,” the state said.“Federal antagonization, through the presence of soldiers in the streets, has already caused real and irreparable damage to the City of Los Angeles, the people who live there, and the State of California. They must be stopped, immediately.”Democrats in California’s congressional delegation and members of the congressional caucuses for Black, Hispanic and Asian and Pacific Islander Democrats also blasted the administration’s role in inflaming the standoff between protesters and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who’d conducted recent raids on workplaces in the area.“President Trump's unlawful decision to deploy the National Guard onto the streets of Los Angeles is a reckless and inflammatory escalation, one designed not to restore calm, but to provoke chaos,” Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette D. Clarke said at a press conference.“Let's be clear about how this began: with peaceful protests sparked by the unlawful and inhumane targeting, detention and deportation of our immigrant neighbors.”Clarke, a New York Democrat, said in response to a reporter’s question that she believed the sending in of troops constituted an impeachable act by Trump.“I definitely believe it is, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it,” she said.‘Met with force’Other Democrats on Capitol Hill have said Monday and Tuesday that Trump engineered the conflict to distract from unpopular provisions of Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” and other issues.“Donald Trump, cornered by his own failures – from pushing a heartless bill that would rip health care away from 16 million Americans, to raising costs from his reckless tariffs, to waging war with Elon Musk – Trump is desperately seeking a distraction,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor Tuesday.“His order to deploy the National Guard and Marines – our own troops – on Americans is not just outrageous and provocative, it’s a dangerous authoritarian overreach that threatens the very fabric of our democracy.”Rep. Jimmy Gomez led a press conference of California’s U.S. House Democrats Tuesday where he warned that the militarization in Los Angeles could happen elsewhere.“If it can happen in Los Angeles, it can happen in any state in the union,” he said.Later, at the Oval Office, Trump said protesters at his military parade on Saturday would be “met with very strong force.”‘Tarred and feathered’U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters Trump acted responsibly to protect Southern Californians and blamed Newsom for “failed leadership” that he said led to the clash this weekend.Asked if, as Trump and White House border czar Tom Homan have suggested, Newsom should be arrested for interfering with immigration enforcement, Johnson initially demurred before suggesting an 18th-century punishment.“I’m not going to give you legal analysis on whether Gavin Newsom should be arrested,” the Louisiana Republican said.“But he ought to be tarred and feathered… He's standing in the way of the administration and the carrying out of federal law. Right? He is applauding the bad guys and standing in the way of the good guys. He is trying to — he's a participant, an accomplice — in our federal law enforcement agents being not just disrespected but assaulted.”Johnson said House Republicans were fully behind Trump’s actions and deflected a question about if there was a point at which he would oppose the administration’s efforts.“He is fully within his authority right now to do what he is doing,” Johnson said. “We have to maintain order.”",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Erin Houchin, left, and South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson, both Republicans, speak with reporters inside the U.S. Capitol on May 21, 2025. (Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)A bipartisan bill cosponsored by U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, to establish clearer regulations for digital assets passed out of a House committee Monday.
The legislation, known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, aims to create a framework for the regulation of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, and the firms that deal in them. 
The bill was introduced to address what Johnson calls uncertainty in the oversight of blockchain-based technologies. A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that is maintained across a worldwide network.
“Over the next few years, blockchain technology will transform most every industry,” Johnson said in a news release. “Unfortunately, regulatory uncertainty has pushed innovation and investment overseas. Our bill creates clear rules of the road, ensuring America will power the future of blockchain and digital assets.”
The bill lays out new disclosure, registration and operational requirements for companies dealing in digital assets. It also seeks to delineate regulatory responsibilities among agencies, providing a clearer legal environment for innovation and enforcement.
The legislation now moves to the full House for consideration.
The bill is sponsored by Rep. French Hill, R-Arkansas. Johnson is one of eight original co-sponsors, including three Democrats.

Kelly Ayotte's bill signing on Tuesday, June 10, 2025. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)I used to like reading “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” to my daughters when they were little. In fact, my wife and I read it aloud so often back then that we still refer to the title when we set out to do one thing and get distracted by a bunch of side tasks that pop up along the way. We’ve all been there: You go to throw an empty can into the recycling bin, which is full, and then on your way to empty it your sock catches on that exposed nail you keep meaning to fix, so you head over to grab the hammer but then realize the tool drawer is stuck, and on and on it goes.
So, it’s a story about getting sidetracked. Gov. Kelly Ayotte and the rest of her party should give it a read.
On Tuesday, Ayotte ceremoniously signed two bills that not only don’t address any of the state’s most pressing problems but actually exacerbate a couple that the party itself created. 
House Bill 10, establishing a “parental bill of rights,” is legislation born out of right-wing, QAnon-esque paranoia about public educators collaborating to undermine the well-being of the students they serve and prevent parents from parenting. To understand the depths of this paranoia, consider this statement from Atkinson Republican Rep. Debra DeSimone, chair of the House Children and Family Law Committee, regarding the Senate’s version of the parental rights bill: “If I know that most parents are way more trustworthy than teachers like Pamela Smart, then I will vote to pass this bill as amended.”
The absurdity of that statement represents a big part of the Republican problem. Between my first day of school at Londonderry’s North Elementary in 1978 and graduation day at Merrimack Valley High School in 1990, I had some great teachers and some not-so-great teachers. I’ve also had good and bad auto mechanics, doctors, plumbers, barbers, etc. I bet that’s true for all of you, and yet none of us (I hope) apply any singular unpleasant experiences definitively across an entire field or industry. But the Republican anti-public-school agenda seems dependent on making people believe, often in opposition to their own broad experiences, that the most notorious of school employees (and, for what it’s worth, Smart was a media coordinator, not a teacher) is somehow representative of the profession — and the system — as a whole.
The Republican Party is the party of dark fantasies. It is the party of distraction (purposeful and otherwise) and of red herrings. And it is also the party of nostalgia, which makes it all the more baffling that its membership is so intent on ripping apart the seams of the communities they claim to cherish.
The second bill signed into law Tuesday, establishing universal eligibility for school vouchers, is a prime example of just how far Republicans have wandered from real public service.
New Hampshire has a school funding problem, and we’ve known this for decades. We know it because of our punishing property taxes and because of the tense nature of our debates over school district budgets. And, we know it because over the past few decades the courts have said so more than once.
Democratic governors in recent state history failed again and again to address the problem, but Republicans have truly excelled at making things much, much worse. Every state eventually learns that vouchers don’t do what Republicans have long said they would — that is, save money and improve educational outcomes. What vouchers do accomplish, however, is hastening the demise of publicly supported places of learning that have educated generations of Americans and helped forge the communities that give us our collective strength. The attempted destruction of public schools is tragic enough, but the budget constraints aggravated by universal vouchers will ultimately lay waste to a much broader swath of public services. If you want to see that dynamic in action, look no further than the cutting crew now going to work on New Hampshire’s budget.
As much as I love the goofy, frantic, full-circle plot of “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie,” I have to admit that the comparison to Republican policy pursuits in New Hampshire is largely flawed. You see, more than anything the mouse is an innocent victim of its own industriousness. It means well but is led astray by an overwhelming desire to create order amid endless strands of unavoidable chaos. Republicans’ inability to avoid getting sidetracked — whether by perverse imaginings about pet-devouring immigrants, or vaccine conspiracies, or presidential robot clones, or sinister teachers — lacks that innocence because it is fully by design. In a country that boasts more than 900 billionaires yet is cutting health care for poor people, Republicans’ foundational, centerpiece principle of trickle-down economics is a really, really tough sell right now. So, if the very existence of your party is predicated on passing laws that help wealthy people become wealthier, you’re going to have to bundle that colossal dud with some visceral distractions. 
That’s really what’s behind all of the trumped-up, misanthropic, right-wing “issues” that push voters to turn against teachers, scientists, researchers, antiracists, climate activists, and others — anyone whose driving ambition is for greater equality and a reduction, by degrees, in overall human suffering.
If you’ve ever wondered why the GOP seems to jump from one hot-button issue to another, at breakneck speed and in the absence of credible data to support their breathless claims, I hope this helps.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/protestersedbills-1024x687.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Maine’s congressional delegation have varying stances on President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard and Marines to quell protests over the administration’s workplace immigration raids in Los Angeles.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree called the move an abuse of power. Independent U.S. Sen. Angus King said it doesn’t appear justified. 
Maine’s other Democratic representative, Jared Golden, and Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins did not condemn the deployment of troops. Collins called it an appropriate use of the National Guard, but not the Marines or other active duty military personnel. 
“The National Guard often responds to domestic emergencies and is well-trained to do so,” Collins said in a statement. “The Marines should only be involved in domestic disturbances in the most extreme emergencies.”
The legality of the deployment is currently being debated in court. 
This is the first time a president has activated a state’s National Guard since 1965 without a request from a governor — something Gov. Janet Mills and other Democratic governors condemned in a joint statement. 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued Trump over the deployment, arguing it is a violation of state sovereignty. Meanwhile, Trump told reporters on the White House South Lawn that he endorsed the idea of White House border czar Tom Homan arresting Newsom.
Trump later deployed Marines on Monday. The city’s police chief has warned that without coordination the Marines’ arrival could cause operational challenges and stated that local law enforcement remain confident in their ability to handle large-scale demonstrations.  
Pingree offered the most pointed critique, saying what’s happening in California should alarm everyone.
“The President is manufacturing a crisis to deliberately inflame tensions in one of America’s largest cities,” Pingree said in a statement to Maine Morning Star. “It’s a flagrant abuse of power, egregious federal overreach, and a chilling attempt to turn our military into a political weapon.”
Pingree also pointed to the Pentagon’s estimate that the mobilization has already cost taxpayers $134 million. Further, the representative condemned the sweeps being carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
“The people of Los Angeles are seeing their neighbors being swept up in unprecedented ICE raids, meant to fill quotas rather than make our communities safer,” Pingree said. “These aren’t violent criminals. They’re workers waiting for jobs and families going home from church, who are suddenly being detained and deported without a shred of due process.”
King stopped short of labeling the deployment as overreach but said that he does not believe the preconditions of the underlying statute Trump cited in justifying his federalization of the National Guard, 10 U.S.C. 12406, have been met. 
These include an invasion or threat of invasion, rebellion or danger of rebellion and that the president is unable to execute the law with regular forces. 
“There has been no evidence of any invasion or rebellion,” King said. “And while a protest could have some impermissible violent actions, it does not constitute a rebellion. Equally important, the history of the use of these provisions has been very rare, and almost always, at the request [of] the governor of the state. To send in the National Guard over the objection of the governor of the state is almost unheard of and certainly doesn’t appear justified in this case.”
King also made a point to state that he does not “in any way condone violence or property damage by the people who are protesting,” but believes the response should be proportional and the use of military personnel should be a last resort.
Collins and Golden focused on the protesters in comments about what’s happening in Los Angeles. 
While Trump and his allies have called the protesters “insurrectionists,” officials in California have called Trump’s response an overreaction to mostly peaceful demonstrations.
Spokesperson Mario Moretto pointed to Golden’s comments on social media in response to a request about his stance, in which the representative wrote, “I encourage demonstrators to exercise their rights peacefully and lawfully, and my expectation is that members of the armed services on the ground will support local law enforcement with the discipline and professionalism that is the bedrock of our military community.”
While not stating whether he supports the deployment of the National Guard or Marines, Golden, who served in the Marine Corps, said he rejects Trump’s strategy of “they spit, we hit,” referring to the president’s comment threatening protestors of physical harm if they spit on police or troops.
Meanwhile Collins shared in a statement to Maine Morning Star, “Violence, threats, and the destruction of property are not acceptable forms of protest.” 
Collins added that she believes it’s important for federal, state, and local leaders to coordinate their response to the demonstrations. “Our law enforcement personnel who are on the ground dealing with this dangerous situation need clear direction and support,” Collins said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Lawmakers are still in disagreement over how much to spend on a proposal they passed during the regular 60 days of the session: added support for foster homes and recruitment of child abuse investigators.
Senate President Ben Albritton championed giving $3 million to the Florida Department of Children and Families to develop a pilot program to place children with behavioral problems in foster family settings rather than group homes. 
The remaining $300,000 is meant to go toward alleviating the 64% turnover rate in employees who investigate child abuse reports. 
The enabling legislation, SB 7012, passed but hasn’t been sent to the governor yet.
But the House offer doesn’t include any funding for those initiatives. 
House Budget Chair Lawrence McClure said the chambers were still in conversations but that there was concern about appropriating the funds before seeing DCF’s plan for the pilot program. 
Not funding the priorities of the other chamber is a familiar tactic, Albritton told reporters last week, regarding a project for a senior center in his hometown.
“Does it surprise me that the House isn’t funding the priority of the Senate president? No, doesn’t surprise me at all, and it doesn’t offend me,” Albritton said.

Amid a challenging upbringing in foster care, animals provided Hailey Bartlett with a sense of connection, consistency, and comfort—ultimately inspiring her to pursue a career as a large-animal veterinarian.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  How a cow’s stomach and a hall pass  helped Hailey Bartlett find her way to college.","Hailey Bartlett vividly recalls the day her boss came up to her at the Bristol dairy farm where she worked and asked if she wanted to help with a “DA.” 
“I didn’t even know what that meant. But I said, ‘sure.’” 
A “DA” is a displaced abomasum, which is the fourth stomach compartment in a cow. This cow, who had recently calved, had gotten her stomach twisted, an uncomfortable yet common condition for dairy cows after giving birth.
“I had no idea what I was getting into. The three of us—my boss, the vet, and I—had to flip over this 2,000-pound animal. I was on one side and pulled the halter down on her head, then stayed on top of the cow to hold her down while the vet treated her. Afterwards, I asked my boss, Brittany, to explain what happened. Her abomasum was twisted, and the vet had to come and untwist it. She demonstrated with a rag. It was fascinating.” 
Noticing her interest, Brittany arranged for Hailey to accompany the same vet a few weeks later on farm visits throughout Addison County. Not only did Hailey get a summer job out of the deal, but it also gave her a valuable realization: being a large-animal vet was what she wanted to do with her life. 
“I knew that was the path I wanted to take,” Hailey says. 
“Animals were my constant”
Hailey grew up around agriculture and participated in many farm-related activities, from 4H shows to Future Farmers of America to youth programs with the Addison County Farmers Coalition. But her interest in animals served a need that went beyond after school projects.   
When Hailey was nine years old, she and her siblings were put into foster care. While she’s lived with some good families, Hailey says that her experience—which included a years-long abusive situation, several moves, and separation from her brothers and sister—has not been positive. Throughout it all, animals were her comfort. 
Every family she lived with had animals—chickens, pigs, geese, goats, a cow or two—and Hailey always took care of them. “Going from foster home to foster home, I never had a solid connection with people, but animals were my constant,” she recalls.
At the start of her junior year, around the time she left her most challenging foster home, Hailey decided she needed a positive outlet. “I was going through a rough time, so a friend and I reached out to this big dairy farm that needed people to work the night shift feeding the calves.” Hailey loved it, and it introduced her to the possibilities of making a career and a life working with large animals. 
This fall, Hailey starts college at SUNY Cobleskill, where she plans to major in animal science. After college, she may go on to veterinary school, or she might work as a vet tech or an animal nutritionist—as long as she can travel from farm to farm and work with animals. “There’ll be no desk job for me,” says Hailey. 
Hall pass mixup opens doors
Applying to college wasn’t part of Hailey’s plan, but when the idea literally landed on her desk through a fortuitous mixup, she started to give it some thought. 
“I received this hall pass one day to go meet with the VSAC counselor. I didn’t even know what VSAC was—and college?—I’d never thought about it,” Hailey recalls. 
But she went to the counseling office and learned the pass was meant for a classmate who is also a “Hailey B.” The VSAC counselor, who works with students in  VSAC’s Talent Search, suggested they chat anyway—and this Hailey was intrigued.
Unfortunately, she encountered an immediate setback. “I was living in my worst foster home at the time, and before I could enroll to work with VSAC, I needed a parent’s signature. They wouldn’t sign it.”
But almost a year later, after Hailey moved out of that house, she came back to VSAC. By that time, the original VSAC counselor Hailey had met with had retired, and Kate Rowland was working with students at the school.
“Despite the traumatic experiences that she has endured, Hailey has such a positive attitude, kind demeanor, and clear vision for her future,” says Rowland. “She has not let her past define her, and she has continually impressed me with her dedication.” 
“Working with an independent student often means that I get to help these students even more than my other first-generation students,” Rowland adds. “Hailey has impressed me with her diligence, responsiveness, and motivation every step of the way.”
Hailey says VSAC’s support was a game-changer, particularly when it came to finances. “I wouldn’t have known about scholarship opportunities. I would have just thought, ‘I’ll pay off the loans when I’m older, no big deal.’ Now I know those scholarships are going to be life-changing in terms of reducing my debt.” 
And for students who don’t live in a traditional two-parent household—whether their parents are divorced, they’re raised by other relatives, or are independent, like Hailey—completing the FAFSA financial aid application is often tricky. “The application process was tough, and I needed a lot of documents. But VSAC made it much easier, and in the end, it was all worth it,” says Hailey.  
As an independent student, Hailey will be paying for her education on her own. Fortunately, she received a generous financial aid package from SUNY Cobleskill, and she’s waiting to hear back from the many scholarships she applied for. 
Hailey credits her best friend—with whom she’ll be sharing a room at SUNY in the fall—and her boss, Brittany, for helping her find her path. “My friend grew up on a farm, introduced me to showing cows, leased me my cow for shows, and gave me so much insight on farming. I wouldn’t be here without her. And Brittany has played a huge part. She can look at an animal and know exactly what’s wrong with it. That’s what I want to be able to do.”

Photo by J.W. Hendricks for CalMattersTwo Democratic members of the Michigan House of Representatives on Tuesday called for non-violent action this Saturday, June 14, when a nationwide protest movement plans to hold rallies against the administration of President Donald Trump and its recent actions to detain and deport large numbers of immigrants.
The call to action comes after a weekend of chaos in Los Angeles and Paramount, California, where protesters formed a resistance response to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The protests began peacefully but escalated as law enforcement descended on the cities to quell the uprisings.
Protests were planned on June 14 before the weekend’s events played out in California. But organizers of the Michigan Resistance Coalition in a virtual call Tuesday said the scenes out of the Golden State further emphasized the need for the No Kings movement to be a peaceful opposition force.
“Let me be clear, what we’re seeing from the Trump administration is not law and order. It’s state sponsored terror,” said Ken Whittaker, the executive director of Michigan United Action. “When ICE agents dressed as military commandos kick in doors and drag people away under the cover of night, that’s not law enforcement, that’s a war on the people.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Whitaker warned that Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to California was a massive overreach and noted that those individuals were trained for war, not non-violent protests or civil disobedience.
Michigan Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) said she is the daughter of a man who served in World War II and helped liberate a Nazi Germany concentration camp. In that vein, she said she was raised to not stand idly by while dictators weaponize a government against its own citizens, as she said Trump is doing now with those who stand up against ICE while they conduct raids.
“We are witnessing something that I hoped we would never see in America, the U.S. military and immigration agents in full military gear on the streets of a major city targeting protesters and the media,” Pohutsky said. “Let me be crystal clear: We unequivocally condemn any violence. That has no place in our movement for peace and justice. Everyone should use their voice peacefully, but the Trump administration intentionally provoked the situation by sending a force of armed and armored agents to round up immigrant workers.”
Pohutsky said the Trump administration is sending waves of armed forces and armed agents to round up immigrant workers, day laborers, garments employees and others all without warrants – a far cry from the gang members and criminals Trump said he’d focus on when making campaign promises for mass deportations.
  State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia), during a virtual call on Tuesday, June 10, 2025, emphasized the need for the No Kings protest set for June 14. | Screenshot
“These are people working hard to provide for their families. They aren’t dangerous. They’re our neighbors and they’re our friends,” Pohutsky said. “The cruelty is the point. Trump and his movement have been clear. He has said repeatedly that he wanted to send in troops against protesters. The MAGA think tank, the Center for Renewing America, wrote a playbook for doing exactly what we are seeing today, using immigration enforcement to provoke confrontation and then using that as a pretext to send in troops against our own citizens.”
It was noted that labor leaders are also becoming targets of ICE, as SEIU President David Huerta was recently detained for protesting ICE activity in Los Angeles.
“This is a wholesale assault on political opposition, and I want to underline this,” Pohutsky said. “Trump’s order sending in troops does not just apply to Los Angeles or California. It applies to the whole country.”
State Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) said she has been worried about this very scenario since Trump was elected to his second term.
“He laid it out in his campaign that he was going to take any excuse he can to use the military to target civilians,” Rhiengans said. “It’s wrong. It’s un-American, and we have to stand up against it.”
She also called on Michigan residents to join the No Kings protests on June 14, which is also Trump’s birthday.
“They’re counting on us,” she said. “They elected us to represent them, and we, all Republicans and Democrats, swore an oath to the United States Constitution, and it’s our duty to defend and protect it.”

Michigan Republicans react to California protests
While some Democrats in Michigan called for further demonstrations, Republicans in Congress and the state Legislature called for new ways to curtail protesters and to create a pathway for local law enforcement to assist ICE.
On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), reintroduced the “Clear the ROADS Act,” which is a direct response to protests unlawfully obstructing traffic on local roads and highways. In a news release, Huizenga said news reports have highlighted that a freeway was shut down by protesters in Los Angeles.
The bill would provide the Trump administration with another tool to hold states accountable when federally-funded roadways are “overrun by these dangerous roadblocking activities.”
“If states are neglecting their duties to keep their federal taxpayer-funded roads free from these traffic-obstructing actions, then federal taxpayer funds should be withheld from those states,” Huizenga said in a statement. “My legislation recognizes that endangering the free flow of ambulances, fire trucks, and other drivers is not an option. Based on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s handling of the recent road-blocking riots in California, the Clear the ROADS Act would provide President Trump … with the ability to penalize California’s access to roughly 400 million in taxpayer-funded federal transportation dollars.”



Huizenga’s bill would:

Withhold 10% of a State’s federal highway funds if the State has not made reasonable efforts to prohibit the reckless obstruction of lawful vehicle traffic on their federal-aid eligible roadways; and
Require the Secretary of Transportation to annually certify whether a State has met this requirement prior to federal highway funds being apportioned.




In Michigan, state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) introduced a resolution calling on local governments to cooperate with ICE in enforcing federal immigration law. The resolution was described as a direct response to the California protests.
In early May, Schriver and several of his Michigan House Freedom Caucus colleagues introduced House Bill 4472. The bill would create a task force to develop policies on “orderly removal” and deportation of immigrants from Michigan. It was referred to the House Government Operations Committee – which is known as the place where bills go to die – and has yet to receive a committee hearing.
Michigan Advance asked Pohutsky and Rheingans about the measures and what kind of friction ICE action has caused with House Republicans who control the chamber.
Pohutsky said that the resolutions or policies that have been brought up by House Republicans have been “heinously anti-immigrant,” but weren’t terribly well-though out and don’t get funding.
“It talks about, in some cases, requiring local units of government to comply with ICE, with no clear direction about what complying actually means, whether or not law enforcement even has the ability in these areas to comply with ICE,” she said. “That doesn’t even begin to take into account the human toll. And you know what? These folks who are our neighbors contribute to our communities, and what the communities want in terms of their neighbors.”
Pohutsky mentioned that the House is bearing down on its self-imposed July 1 deadline for having its budget ready to present for final passage, but no such budget bill has emerged from House Republicans.
“We need to be working on things that will actually help people, not targeting some of the most vulnerable people in our communities,” she said.
Rheingans said House Bill 4472 would, in effect, create a Michigan Gestapo focused squarely on immigration enforcement.
“You’re seeing this extremism play out not only in resolutions, but also in bills, and these things are going to run up the tab in our state,” she said. “It is important to make sure that we keep track of what Republicans are doing, and not just what they’re saying. They’re trying to run up the tab, waste our money and target people that they don’t like, and it’s not right. That’s dictatorial and authoritarian behavior. And there are no kings in America.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-10-171529-1024x605.png,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Kelly Ayotte signed two pieces of legislation Tuesday, one to extend the education freedom account program to all income levels and another to give families more control over their schools, delivering significant victories to “school choice” conservatives. 
Flanked by children in a crowded council chamber room adjacent to her corner office in the State House Tuesday morning, Ayotte signed Senate Bill 295, which allows families of all income levels to access state funds for private and home schooling expenses, and House Bill 10, which enumerates a number of requirements for public schools to respond to parental demands. 
“No one loves a child more than a parent, and making sure that parents have rights and can understand and know what’s happening in their classrooms when their children are in school is so, so important,” Ayotte said.
Republicans have hailed the two bills as instrumental to allowing parents the freedom to make choices for their children and avoid mandates from public school districts.
But LGBTQ+ advocates have denounced HB 10, which they say could require school employees to disclose information about a students’ gender identity or sexual orientation to their parents, even when the student asks the school employee not to. And Democrats and public school supporters say expanding education freedom account will take away state money that should be spent on public schools.
HB 10 lays out a number of requirements for public schools, as well as a list of rights that parents have to be informed about regarding what public schools are teaching and what their children are doing during the school day. 
For instance, the bill lists the rights to opt a student out of sex education courses; choose not to participate in any non-academic survey; receive all educational records for their children within 10 days of asking; review instructional materials, and others. Many of those are already allowed under existing state law. The bill also requires school districts to adopt policies to encourage parental cooperation with teachers over homework, attendance, and discipline.  
HB 10 also includes the right for parents to “inquire of the school or school personnel and promptly receive accurate, truthful, and complete disclosure regarding any and all matters related to their minor child, unless an immediate answer cannot be provided when the initial request is made.” That requirement does not apply to information brought to any counselor, school psychologist, school nurse, or other certified health care provider that is “reasonably expected to be privileged.”
The bill allows school staff to withhold information if they have “clear and convincing” evidence that disclosing it could lead to the child being abused by their parent. And it also allows parents to sue the school if they allege any part of the bill is being violated.
SB 295, meanwhile, removes income caps from the education freedom account program, which allows parents to access at least $4,182 per year in state funding to use toward nonpublic school education expenses. Currently, that program is limited to families making 350% of the federal poverty level or less — or $112,525 for a family of four. 
SB 295 imposes a 10,000-student cap on the program in the first year of the expansion — the 2025-2026 school year — and would increase that cap by 25% per year if demand for the program hits at least 90% of the previous year’s cap. The EFA program had 5,321 students at the start of the 2024-2025 school year under the 350% federal poverty level cap, according to the Department of Education.
However, a group of “priority guideline” students would not be subject to that cap, according to the new law. That would include students already enrolled in an EFA program, siblings of students enrolled in the program, children with disabilities, and students in families making up to 350% of the federal poverty levels.
Both bill signings represent the culmination of years of work by conservatives. Efforts in previous years to lift income caps on education freedom accounts were voted down in the Senate, while House Republicans have spent four years attempting and failing to pass a parental bill of rights.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ayottebills-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Lindsay GrahamA pair of Republican U.S. senators are casting shade on the prospect of Donald Trump’s most Nevada-centric campaign promise making it to the finish line in Trump’s big budget bill.
“There’s some things that the president wants, like no tax on tips and overtime. All this may be hard to fit in completely,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Semafor. Graham, who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, has a solution: Pass another bill later — or perhaps yet another one after that — and put no tax on tips in one of those.
Graham’s outlook is generous to the policy proposal, compared to comments from Senate Finance Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI).
Politico reported Monday that Johnson and perhaps other members of the Senate Finance Committee, which Johnson chairs, are concerned that removing taxes on tips will have little to no impact on economic growth.
A core premise of one strain of Republican tax gospel is that the best tax cuts are those sparking economic growth which will enhance federal revenue over the long run and reduce the deficit.
Asked by Politico if no tax on tips is “pro-growth,” Johnson answered “nope.”
Nevada U.S. Senate Democrats Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto are among cosponsors of standalone legislation to eliminate tax on tips. Both Nevada senators argue the measure should pass on its own merits and not be saddled with the larger legislation backed by Trump and Republicans, which cuts Medicaid, SNAP, and multiple other popular programs while providing costly tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit wealthy and corporate taxpayers.
No tax on tips is frequently panned by policy and economic analysts on both sides of the political divide. But grumblings from Graham and Johnson notwithstanding, the likelihood of no tax on tips being left out of any initial Trump taxing and spending bill is extremely remote. The provision has already been included in the version of the bill passed by the House. And Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson are both indicating it will be included in the final iteration of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lindseygraham-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo provided by S.C. Forestry Commission)COLUMBIA — After fighting three large fires earlier this year, the state’s Forestry Commission is in the market to buy two airplanes that could help with future efforts.
With final approval Tuesday from the state’s fiscal oversight board, the commission can use $1.4 million from its reserves to replace two of its 10 planes with newer, more dependable models, according to documents submitted to the State Fiscal Accountability Authority.
Those two planes, which are part of a decades-old fleet, have caused maintenance costs to climb and are more often out of commission, leading to the potential for gaps in firefighting during a year in which the commission has faced massive wildfires, Forester Scott Phillips wrote in a letter to the panel.
Altogether, between Jan. 1 and the end of May, more than 31,000 acres burned in the state, commission spokesman Doug Wood told the SC Daily Gazette. For comparison, an average of 8,000 acres burned during the five years prior, he said. None of the fires led to injuries or deaths, and no structures were damaged, Forestry Commission officials have said.
The commission’s fleet of planes help spot and fight fires, as well as assess damage from storms, insects and diseases that affect trees, Phillips wrote in a letter seeking permission to spend an additional $1 million. That’s on top of the $425,000 that legislators provided the agency in the 2022-23 state budget to buy two planes, which has gone unspent. Aircraft prices skyrocketed soon after, leaving the commission unable to find suitable planes for that price tag, he wrote.
SC replacing state planes amid growing maintenance costs

Typically, the commission leases its planes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture through a program that loans federal hand-me-down planes, often originally used by the Department of Defense, to state foresters. Nearly the entire 10-plane fleet was manufactured in the 1960s, and two have mounting maintenance needs that make them more expensive and less effective, Wood said.
Because of the ages of the commission’s existing planes, they are “more costly to maintain and have more downtime, which results in canceled missions due to aircraft availability,” Phillips wrote.
The commission plans to buy two used four-seater Cessna 182T planes, produced between 2001 and 2013, which often sell for somewhere between $450,000 and $600,000. If none are available within the price range, the commission will pivot to buy the best plane that comes up on the market that the agency can afford, Phillips wrote.
The expense of flying in aircraft from other states to fight three major fires this spring led to another funding request. The commission needed approval to use $1.5 million meant for salaries this fiscal year — but unspent due to vacancies at the agency — to instead cover its “unprecedented” wildfire fighting costs, according to committee documents.
The five-member oversight board approved the request Tuesday without discussion.
The Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires in the Upstate, coupled with the Covington Drive fire in Horry County’s Carolina Forest, burned more than 18,000 acres at the end of March and into early April. Fighting those fires had cost the commission about $11.3 million by mid-April, when the commission made its request, Phillips wrote.
That number has likely grown, since the fires continued to burn long after they were contained. The total cost of fighting more than 1,500 fires that have burned across the state since the beginning of the year has not yet been calculated, since most of that comes from the agency’s usual $55 million budget, Wood said.
Firefighting partners from Florida took over command of the Horry County fire in March to give the South Carolina firefighters time to rest. Outside contractors also helped contain, suppress and monitor all three major fires, Wood said.
Because of the large number of acres burned, especially during those three fires, those extra resources “provided valuable assistance,” according to committee documents.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/table-rock-fire-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Getty image)Four new laws signed on June 6 by Gov. Dan McKee aim to improve emergency care for heart attacks on golf courses, train lifeguards and park rangers to administer Narcan, extend the trial period for the state’s safe injection site in Providence, and formalize the waiting period before adults with drivers permits can take their road test.
Here’s a look at the legislation behind the four new laws:
1. Automatic external defibrillators will now be required on golf courses as a result of the David Casey Act. Its namesake is a Johnston golfer who died after having a heart attack on the 18th hole at the Cranston Country Club. Casey was 58 years old.
Companion bills, sponsored by Rep. Deborah Fellela and Sen. Andrew Dimitri, both Johnston Democrats, amended the state’s rules on locations where defibrillators  are mandatory.
State law had required defibrillators in enclosed spaces capable of holding 300 or more people. Spaces include bars, self-service laundry, shopping malls, arenas, government offices, and waiting rooms.
“David’s death was tragic, and has mobilized his widow, Betsy, to become an advocate for AEDs on all golf courses,” Fellela said in a statement issued by the State House Tuesday. “She wants to make sure that David’s death makes a difference, and if we save even one life, we reach that goal.”
Rhode Island Department of Health Director Jerome “Jerry” Larkin voiced support for the legislation in a Feb. 6 letter to the House Committee on Health and Human Services. He stated that using defibrillators and performing CPR within minutes of cardiac arrest can significantly boost survival rates.
2. The nation’s first state-regulated safe injection site will continue for another two years. Project Weber/RENEW, the nonprofit that operates the South Providence site at 45 Willard Ave., was supposed to end its pilot overdose prevention program in 2026. Legislation sponsored by Rep. Jay Edwards, a Tiverton Democrat, extends the program through 2028.
The law also mandates new reporting requirements on the number of people connected to other specialists for addiction treatment, and total overdoses prevented.
McKee, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and the Mental Health Association of Rhode Island each wrote to lawmakers to back the extension bill.
“Even one more life lost to substance use disorder and the opioid epidemic is one too many and HRCs are a critical preventative resource,” McKee wrote to the committee in February.
Companion legislation was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Melissa Murray, a Woonsocket Democrat.
3. Rhode Island’s lifeguards and park rangers will now be required to be trained in administering opioid reversal drugs such as Narcan.
This mandate comes from companion bills sponsored by Rep. William O’Brien, a North Providence Democrat, and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian, a Smithfield Democrat. The bill also requires  public beaches and parks to have at least four doses of this medicine available at all times.
“The sad reality we find ourselves in today is that opioid overdoses can happen anytime and anywhere,” O’Brien said in a statement. “While we continue to combat the opioid crisis, this bill will save many lives.” 
The legislation originated from North Providence High School student Brennan O’Connor’s senior project, according to a State House news release. 
4. Rhode Island residents age 18 or older will have to wait at least 30 days after receiving a learner’s permit before taking the road test.
The law signed by McKee stems from matching bills sponsored by Democrats Rep. Robert Phillips of Woonsocket and Sen. Lou DiPalma of Middletown. It requires adults to wait at least 30 days after receiving a learner’s permit before taking the road test for a full license.
Rhode Island’s Division of Motor Vehicles already mandates a 30-day waiting period, agency spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said via email Tuesday. It just was never codified under state law.
“A way to make certain things clear and succinct — you put it into Rhode Island General Law” DiPalma said in an interview. 
Under the new law, adult drivers’ permits would expire one year after being issued. Permits can be renewed, but just once.

Ned Lamont’s celebration Tuesday of a groundbreaking advance in early childhood education funding and his simultaneous struggle to calm concerns about a housing bill underscore the advantages and liabilities of incumbency as he edges towards a reelection campaign.
Lamont, 71, a Democrat who has scored high approval ratings since rebounding during COVID-19 from a difficult first year, shared his inclination to seek a third term on Thursday, the morning after the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session.
One immediate result is the heightened interest in how ably Lamont frames and exploits his legislative wins and how nimbly he can navigate, minimize or resolve controversies. 
Both tasks were on display Tuesday.
Lamont, who was preparing to take an overnight flight to the Paris Air Show, twice updated reporters on his conversations with legislative leaders about his reservations over elements of House Bill 5002, the housing legislation passed by relatively narrow margins.
By day’s end, Lamont said he was inclined to sign the bill — assuming a deal is struck assuring that his misgivings would be addressed prior to it taking effect in October. Other sections would take effect next year.
“We’re desperately short of housing. That impacts affordability, impacts economic growth. This bill goes a long way to solving that,” Lamont said. “I think they went over the top in a couple of places.”
His misgivings included a section requiring communities to divide housing need among towns and assign each town a number of units to plan and zone for. He called that “a planning tool” but one that is being misread as a mandate.
Childhood education bill celebrated
A celebration of Senate Bill 1, a measure that will create a trust fund projected to raise salaries for child care workers, increase access and lower costs for parents, had all the ingredients of a campaign ad, save one.
The forecast of rain moved the event from a telegenic play area outside an early childhood education and care center to a third-floor function room in the state Capitol. But the vibe was happy to the point of giddy.
Beth Bye, who has run a well-regarded preschool, helped create the Office of Early Childhood as a state senator in 2013 and has run that office since Lamont took office in 2019, commanded the audience to rise for a sing a long as she once did for little children.
The room was packed with advocates, including day-care teachers and parents who readily complied. They sang “If You’re Happy And You Know It.”
And yes, someone eventually thrust an infant into the arms of the governor. The child wore a yellow shirt with the message, “Thank you governor.” Lamont proclaimed the press event to be “the happiest” of his tenure.
The new off-budget early childhood trust fund drew opposition from Republicans, who saw it as weakening the state’s fiscal guardrails by drawing some surplus funds away from paying down debt and the unfunded pension liability.
But Bye said it provides a structural solution to what the late Gwen Morgan, a national advocate and strategist on child care, termed the “trilemma” of simultaneously addressing quality, accessibility and affordability.
“Gwen Morgan made up this term in the 1980s to highlight the inherent tradeoff policy makers were constantly making, and same with providers, because when you can improve one goal, sometimes it would undermine the other,” Bye said. 
Improving quality meant higher costs. Higher cost meant less accessibility. Controlling costs often meant lower wages, higher turnover and poorer quality.
The Lamont administration’s initiative has roots in the COVID-19 pandemic, when the governor said that he was dramatically reminded of how the absence of adequate child care can shut vital services and the economy.
“All of a sudden, I heard from nurses, ‘We cannot go to the hospital to take care of those folks most in need, unless we have a place where our kids can go, where they can be safe.’ And all of a sudden you realize how vital quality early childhood is for our economy,” Lamont said.
Kyla Siegmann, the executive director of the Trinity College Community Child Center, said the governor was hardly alone in that realization.
“Despite the critical role early educators play in shaping the future, we have operated in the shadows, underfunded, undervalued and often unseen,” she said. “Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, and in that time of crisis, a light was cast upon our work, not a spotlight, but a beacon.”
The trust fund will increase availability beginning next year but will bring more dramatic improvements in 2027 through 2032. Early childhood education programs will have access to state grants that will require adherence to a pay structure equal to public school teachers, Bye said.
Child care teachers earn on average about $36,000 annually, Bye said.
“This endowment will increase reimbursement rates by 88% for participating programs who will need to agree to paying teachers on par with public school teachers,” Bye said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7833-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Bob Ferguson called a meeting Tuesday afternoon with the state’s top military official about what’s going on in Los Angeles, where Trump summoned thousands of National Guard troops in response to protests over immigration enforcement. Trump’s move was the first time in 60 years that a president had deployed the National Guard to a state without the governor’s consent.
“It’s deeply disturbing. He’s escalating the situation, it’s resulting in more violence because of the president’s calling in the National Guard over the governor’s objection, and that’s exactly what Donald Trump wants,” Ferguson said Tuesday. “My job as governor is to make sure we’re as prepared as we possibly can be here.”
Trump says this action was necessary to protect U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement agents and the broader public amid demonstrations that have damaged property. California officials countered that local law enforcement could handle it. 
California is suing the administration, which has since also sent Marines to Los Angeles, over the National Guard deployment. State officials there say the president is violating the 10th Amendment that protects state sovereignty.
Trump has cited federal law allowing the president to call out National Guard troops if “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” The statute also allows for deployments in the case of foreign invasion or if “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”
Democratic officials across the country worry the situation in Los Angeles could be a test run for similar moves in their states and cities.
Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown, both of whom are Democrats, told the Standard on Tuesday that the president’s actions haven’t come as a surprise. In fact, they’ve been playing out this scenario since shortly after they both won election in November. 
Trump has previously floated the idea of using the military to curb civil unrest. And, during his first term, National Guard troops from multiple states deployed as part of the federal response to 2020 protests in Washington, D.C.
Brown noted the law the president cites for the California deployment says such orders “shall be issued” by the governor. And the situation in California doesn’t meet any of the three circumstances where a National Guard deployment would be lawful, he said.
“If the facts arose here that were the same as California, it would be illegal,” Brown said.
He didn’t rule out a circumstance where the president could have the state’s consent to deploy the Guard. 
“I don’t want to presuppose that we would challenge everything, because it really depends on what the facts are,” he said.
A state Military Department spokesperson agreed it’s hard for the state to plan for the unknown. 
“I wish we could see the future and develop concrete plans and tell you what we’re planning for,” Karina Shagren said Tuesday.
Across the country, organizers are planning “No Kings” protests against Trump this Saturday, including in Seattle, Olympia and elsewhere in the state. The protests will coincide with the president’s scheduled military parade in Washington, D.C. 
Seattle has a long history of massive street protests that have crossed over from civil disobedience to property destruction and resulted in force from police, including in response to a World Trade Organization conference in 1999 and the murder of George Floyd in 2020.
Brown emphasized he doesn’t want protesters acting out violently and “playing into the hands of the Trump administration.”
“We love to protest here, obviously, which is great, but we have to do it in accordance with our laws,” the attorney general said.
In February, Ferguson’s top aides had debated sending 200 troops from the state’s National Guard to the Canadian border to combat drug trafficking — and get ahead of the president potentially federalizing the Guard. 
State Adjutant General Gent Welsh, with whom Ferguson was meeting Tuesday, floated the idea. The Military Department went so far as to draft a letter pitching it from the governor to the Trump administration. But Ferguson ultimately decided not to move forward.
Welsh commands the state’s National Guard, directs the Washington Military Department and serves as the governor’s homeland security advisor.
The governor championed a bill this legislative session to give him authority to limit National Guard troops from other states from entering Washington, after Republican governors offered their troops to support Trump’s immigration crackdown. He signed the bill in April, and it went into effect immediately.
Meanwhile, Ferguson on Friday ordered a handful of state National Guard personnel to assist in the search for Travis Decker, a man accused of killing his three young daughters near Leavenworth.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/los-angeles-protests-national-guard-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)After bipartisan legislative leaders publicly pronounced an infrastructure bill dead for the year, they resurrected it during closed-door negotiations and shepherded the $700 million deal through the Legislature during a one-day special session Monday. 
The infrastructure bill is called a “bonding bill” because the state government issues bonds — i.e. borrows money — to pay for the projects. Sixty percent of both the House and Senate must vote “yes” to allow the state to issue bonds, so bonding bills require robust bipartisan support. This one passed 116-15 in the House and 57-10 in the Senate.
The bill distributes money across the state to a wide variety of projects. In some cases, the funding will go to a state agency, which has discretion over where exactly the money goes; in other cases, lawmakers directed money to a specific project. 
The DFL-controlled Legislature passed a $2.6 billion infrastructure package in the 2023 session, including $1.5 billion in bonds. In 2020, lawmakers passed a $1.9 billion bonding bill.
Here are the biggest-ticket items: 

$176 million to the Minnesota Public Facilities Agency to build, upgrade and repair municipal water treatment plants. 
$84 million to Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system, mostly for asset preservation; $24 million will go toward a new transportation center at Alexandria Technical and Community College.
$80 million to the Minnesota Department of Transportation, largely for road and bridge repairs. 
$60 million to the University of Minnesota. 
$67 million for a new Bureau of Criminal Apprehension headquarters in Mankato.
$55 million for a new 50-bed psychiatric facility on the campus of the Anoka Metro Regional Treatment Center.
$44 million to the Department of Natural Resources for asset preservation, accessibility, flood mitigation and more at state parks.
$40 million for repairs and upgrades of state prisons.
$29 million to the Minnesota Housing Finance Authority, mostly for the rehabilitation of public housing.
$16 million to the Metropolitan Council, the vast majority for metro-area sewer work and $1 million for tree planting.
$13.7 million to the Minnesota Zoo, mostly for a new animal hospital.
$11.5 million for the Capitol complex, mostly to make one of the underground tunnels connecting the buildings compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. The rest is for asset preservation and security improvements.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-12-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503
,DC,2025-06-10 20:29:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump’s steep proposed cuts to medical research funding draw bipartisan flak,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-steep-proposed-cuts-medical-research-funding-draw-bipartisan-flak,,"WASHINGTON — National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya testified Tuesday that he will work with Congress to potentially reverse a steep cut to the agency’s funding the White House proposed earlier this year in its budget request.Bhattacharya told highly critical Republicans and Democrats on the Senate panel that writes the NIH’s annual spending bill that he’s “happy” to work with lawmakers to find a funding level that everyone can support in the months ahead.“This is my first time through this budget fight and so I'm still learning. But I'll tell you, what I understand is that the budget is a collaborative effort between Congress and the administration,” Bhattacharya said. “I look forward to working with you all to advance the real health needs — not just the folks here in the room who represent Alzheimer's patients, but also the health needs of all Americans.”Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, said it was “disturbing” that the president’s budget request suggested lawmakers cut NIH funding by about $18 billion, or 40%, in the upcoming spending bill.“It would undo years of congressional investment in NIH,” Collins said. “And it would delay or stop effective treatments and cures from being developed for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, type one diabetes. I could go on and on.“We also risk falling behind China and other countries that are increasing their investment in biomedical research.”Collins said the committee planned to work with Bhattacharya “to remedy these problems and the deficiencies” in the budget request in the months ahead as the committee writes the annual government funding bills.Collins also rebuked Bhattacharya for seeking to reduce how much the NIH pays grantees for facilities and administrative costs, which go toward paying bills that aren’t directly associated with just one research project.NIH efforts to cap those indirect costs at 15% are on hold as lawsuits from Democratic attorneys general, the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Association of American Universities work through the federal court system.“This proposed cap is so poorly conceived,” Collins said. “And I have seen firsthand how harmful it is. It is leading to scientists leaving the United States for opportunities in other countries. It's causing clinical trials to be halted and promising medical research to be abandoned. It's also against federal law. Since 2018, we in Congress have specifically included language to prevent NIH from arbitrarily imposing such a cap.”Collins told Bhattacharya to talk with Kelvin K. Droegemeier, who worked as President Donald Trump's science adviser during his first term. Droegemeier is chairman of a group put together by the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities to propose changes to the indirect costs model.‘Frankly, catastrophic’Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, pressed Bhattacharya to defend the actions he’s taken so far and those proposed in the budget request.“What the Trump administration is doing to NIH right now is, frankly, catastrophic,” Murray said. “Over the past few months, this administration has fired and pushed out nearly 5,000 critical employees across NIH, prevented nearly $3 billion in grant funding from being awarded and terminated nearly 2,500 grants totaling almost $5 billion for life-saving research that is ongoing that includes clinical trials for HIV and Alzheimer's disease.”Murray added that no one in America wants less research into treatments and cures for cancer, or Alzheimer's disease.West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, chairwoman of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations subcommittee that held the hearing, expressed concern about NIH's proposed budget cuts, saying they have raised alarms at numerous research universities.“These institutions are the reason America has kept the edge in biomedical research and innovation,” Capito said. “As with many changes in leadership, there seems to be a heightened set of concern and confusion that diverting resources from research will result in a less healthy America.”Capito emphasized she expects NIH to continue to focus research efforts on Alzheimer's, a disease that affects more than 7 million Americans.“For almost a decade, this committee has supported research towards the goals of finding treatments and a cure for Alzheimer's disease,"" Capito said. ""This goal is very personal to me, as you know, since both of my parents lived with and eventually succumbed to this disease. And I could look out behind you and see in the audience that many folks here are extremely interested in that area of research.”Delayed funding in the statesWisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, ranking member on the subcommittee, also reprimanded Bhattacharya for cutting off funding for projects looking into Alzheimer's and several other illnesses.“NIH has delayed $65 million in funding for 14 Alzheimer's disease research centers in nine states, including at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,” Baldwin said. “It has delayed $47 million in cancer center support grants at nine cancer centers in eight states, it has delayed $55 million for 11 rare disease clinical research network grants in eight states.“Let that sink in: This administration is making a conscious choice not to fund research into Alzheimer's disease, cancer and rare diseases. And NIH has terminated grants for maternal morbidity and mortality centers, a grant developing new digital imaging techniques for cervical cancer screening and a clinical trial studying a potential cure for infants born with HIV, just to name a few.”Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt called on Bhattacharya to ensure NIH refocuses on maternal health research and ways to decrease the country’s high maternal mortality rate.“Look, far too many women in this country are dying from pregnancy-related causes,” Britt said. “You look at Alabama, we have one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation. It disproportionately affects Black women, Native American women, those women in rural areas.”",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

The district had banned hugely popular and celebrated books including “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” “The Bluest Eye” and “The Kite Runner,” among others. The settlement requires them to be returned to library shelves. 
Education Minnesota sued the district in March on behalf of students, teachers and parents, alleging that the district was violating state law by banning books based on their ideas, stories and characters. The American Civil Liberties Union also filed a separate lawsuit. 
In 2024, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor-controlled Legislature passed a law touted as a ban on book bans. The law does allow for books to be removed from shelves based on practical reasons, “legitimate pedagogical concerns, including but not limited to the appropriateness of potentially sensitive topics for the library’s intended audience,” and to comply with other state or federal laws. But school districts cannot remove books based solely on its viewpoint or the messages, ideas or opinions it contains.
St. Francis Area Schools relied on a website called booklooks.org — which has ties to the right-wing group Moms for Liberty — to determine which books were subject to removal from school shelves. (Booklooks has since shut down, but a third-party organization is maintaining the website’s catalog.)
The St. Francis case provides a free speech victory following years of repression of books, especially those with themes about race, sexuality and gender.
“I think the book ban movement … it really has little to do with protecting children. It has everything to do with targeting books with diverse viewpoints that may not be in line with the reviewers’ political or religious beliefs,” “Kite Runner” author Khaled Hosseini told the Reformer in March.
In the settlement with the teachers union, St. Francis Area Schools agreed to put the books back on shelves and create a new library materials policy that guarantees input from parents and qualified media specialists.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/gettyimages-2148912235-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Wren Dumais is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program, in partnership with Vermont Public. This story was produced first for the ear. We’ve also provided a transcript below.

Do you know how to do a wheelie in a wheelchair? Mo O’Neill does.
O’Neill is an adaptive athlete who rides wheelchair motocross, or WCMX. And when they’re not in college classes, snuggling with their cat and dog or making TikTok videos, you can find them dropping in at one of Burlington’s skateparks.
Mo O’Neill: Hey, my name’s Mo. I’m an adaptive athlete and I ride wheelchair motocross.
I think that being paralyzed was just a moment where I kind of realized how much dependency I was feeling, which didn’t align with my vision of myself. And I started immediately searching for a thrill.
And I started looking up pretty much any adaptive sport ever. And I went through monoskiing, murderball, before I landed on obsessively watching videos of wheelchairs at the skatepark.

Wren Dumais: Do you remember your first drop in?
Mo O’Neill: I was with my girlfriend, Caroline, and I showed up at the skatepark. I was so nervous. I wasn’t in a specialized chair yet, I didn’t have a helmet, I didn’t even have a seatbelt on.
Once I got to the top of the tiniest drop-in at the park, I felt everyone’s eyes on me. As well as the height, the sheer height of it all — it was terrifying, I was shaking. But also, that was the first time I really felt that much adrenaline.
And I didn’t want everyone to see me fail. So that was mainly the reason that I didn’t want to do it. And so once I realized that, I kind of realized how stupid it was.

And Caroline told me, she was like, ‘Oh, if you’re scared, just go in backwards.’ And that laughed me out of all of the fear because, I don’t know if anyone knows anything about wheelchairs, but the center of gravity would send me flying.
And so I just did it. And I landed it. And my legs flew off the footplate, and everyone stared, but it was smooth. And it was the best feeling I have ever had. It felt like home. And I’ve just never stopped wanting to drop in since that moment.
The WCMX chair is built like a tank. It is fully welded, including all of the side guards, something that would be removable on another chair. The wheels have extra spokes and are racing tires built for concrete. There is full suspension in the back of the frame, as well as shocks in both the frame and the casters. And then typically they will have a grind bar on the back. And then we usually replace any casters with skate wheels, like just skateboard wheels.
One time, at the skatepark, I was kind of loitering at the top of the bowl. And people were kinda at the other side of the skatepark, and apparently they were watching me, ’cause after I landed this girl, like, sprinted up to me and she was like, lit up, and she was like, ‘I don’t know if this is offensive, but I saw you at the top and I had no idea, like, I did not expect you to do that, but it was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.’
And it was just so genuine. And I feel like no skater — like when I fall, even, like, the people at the park don’t treat me like somebody in a wheelchair who’s fallen. They treat me like a skater who’s fallen. So they’re just like, ‘You good, bro?’ Whereas if I fall on the street, the world stops.
Photo by Wren Dumais/CNS
This is kind of the first time that, like, my recklessness and stubbornness has really, really served me. Like, WCMX is the reason that I’m able to adapt to life as a paraplegic — a lot more than pretty much any medical treatment that I’ve ever received.

Harkay won in the Local Reporting category for her story about Connecticut resident Aleysha Ortiz, who graduated from Hartford Public High School in 2024 without ever being taught to read or write. The story outlines the circumstances that pushed her haphazardly through the school system without receiving instruction in reading or writing.
Reaction to the story was swift, with Connecticut lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raising concerns about the oversight of public school funding, some calling for a state review of Hartford’s finances during Ortiz’s time in the school system and many saying they would push for legislative reform to address the issues raised by the young woman’s case.
Nearly 100,000 people have read Harkay’s story, and following its publication, newsrooms including The Washington Post and CNN have covered Ortiz’s lawsuit against Hartford.
“The Livingston Award not only recognizes excellence in journalism, it recognizes a commitment on the part of news organizations to nurture and coach the young journalists who are the future of this profession,” said CT Mirror Executive Editor Elizabeth Hamilton. “We are thrilled for Jessika that her story about Aleysha has reached such a wide audience and garnered such accolades and hopeful that it adds meaningfully to the conversation about literacy and special education services in our public schools.”
Livingston Award Judge Maria Elena Salinas, an independent journalist who formerly worked at ABC News and Univision, called Ortiz’s story “fascinating.”
“The first few paragraphs of the article grab you. How is it possible that a young lady who graduated from high school and is now entering college was never taught how to read and write?” Salinas said. “Aleysha Ortiz’s story is fascinating not just because of the obvious failure of the Hartford public school system, but because of how this remarkable young woman is fighting for her right to learn in spite of her learning disabilities. Jessika Harkay, a 24-year-old education reporter for The Connecticut Mirror, stumbled upon Aleysha’s story and ran with it. In doing so she gave Aleysha a voice and prompted efforts to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
The Livingston Award was established in 1981. Each year, the judges — a group of accomplished journalists, many of whom hold leadership roles in large newsrooms — review hundreds of stories to choose one winner in each of the International, National and Local reporting categories. Past winners have included David Remnick and Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker and Christiane Amanpour of CNN.
This year’s international reporting winner was Nicole Sadek, 26, of International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, for an investigation titled “The Lost Village,” and this year’s national winners were Esmy Jimenez, 30, and Sydney Brownstone, 34, of The Seattle Times, in a partnership with KUOW Public Radio, for three episodes of the “Lost Patients” podcast.
Harkay’s last day at CT Mirror was June 6. Next month, she will begin covering education at The 74, a national nonprofit newsroom covering education in America.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Harkay-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The vice chairman of the Kansas Board of Regents intends to resign from the state higher education board rather than complete the final two years of his second term.
Jon Rolph, president and CEO of a Wichita restaurant company, was appointed to the Board of Regents in 2019 by Gov. Laura Kelly. He is expected to depart by June 30. The governor would appoint a replacement, subject to confirmation by the Kansas Senate, to finish a term ending in June 2027.
The nine-person Board of Regents has jurisdiction over public universities, community colleges and technical colleges in Kansas.
“Jon is an enthusiastic supporter of higher education who has prioritized the needs of Kansans and our state during his time on the board,” said Carl Ice, chairman of the Board of Regents.
Ice said Rolph “helped our system implement and move forward many key strategic initiatives. He has been an outstanding colleague.”
In 2021, Rolph endorsed a board policy that made it easier for campus administrators of the six state universities to suspend, dismiss or terminate employees, including tenured faculty members, without formally declaring a financial emergency. The policy was implemented in 2022 by Emporia State University to justify dismissal of 30 faculty. It triggered a state and federal court battle that continued into 2025.
In 2023, Rolph revealed that he had surgery to remove a tumor in his abdomen and was undergoing treatment for cancer.
Rolph was serving as chairman of the Board of Regents when the board voted in 2024 to change its diversity and multiculturalism policy under pressure from members of the Kansas Legislature.
The revised policy declared state universities in Kansas couldn’t require faculty to pledge “allegiance to, support for or opposition to diversity, equity or inclusion” or DEI.
“This is, again, our good-faith effort in trying to listen to the Legislature,” Rolph said at the time.
Rolph’s company, Thrive Restaurant Group, operates or owns more than 170 restaurants. It is the second-largest Applebee’s franchisee with restaurants in 15 states.

That’s because sediments in some areas under the valley are thicker than expected, researchers said in a news release — and thicker sediments can lead to stronger shaking during an earthquake.
“In a basin, seismic shaking is amplified. It’s very important to understand the thickness and rigidity of sediment to better assess potential shaking. The sediment is thicker than previously thought — especially in the heavily populated area south of Salt Lake City,” study leader Fan-Chi Lin, an associate professor of geology and geophysics at the university said in the release.
The state is still rebuilding infrastructure shaken up by the 5.7 magnitude Magna earthquake that happened in 2020. However, often referred to as “the big one,” a future earthquake of 6.75 or greater magnitude is highly probable at the Wasatch Front in the next 50 years, according to Envision Utah.

With about 80% of the state’s population living in the area, experts estimate that could be an exceptionally devastating event.
“Our findings reinforce the idea that a hazard exists in the valley and that shaking could be stronger than expected. Many houses in Salt Lake are unreinforced masonry and could be vulnerable in a big quake,” Lin said. “Buildings should be reinforced, and people should be prepared.”
After installing an extensive network of seismic data sensors along the valley after the spring of 2020 and analyzing seismic waves from distant earthquakes, Lin’s team created a revised and refined three-dimensional seismic velocity model to map the Wasatch Front’s geologic structure and identify earthquake hazard sites.
That model allowed the researchers to find thicker sediment deposits than previously estimated, and can provide answers when preparing for “the big one.”
“If we know the subsurface structure very well, then we can predict how strong the ground motion will be when the big earthquake happens,” Lin said. “And that will allow us to collaborate with the engineers to determine which buildings are potentially hazardous when the big earthquake hits.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit’s locomotive engineers ratified a contract after five years of negotiations and the first strike at the agency in more than 40 years, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen announced Tuesday.
Many details of the agreement, which union members approved in a 398-21 vote, remain unclear, but the union said it would bring engineer pay to more than $50 an hour and include a signing bonus.
“This agreement brings us close to what our peers make for doing the same type of work with the same levels of experience and training,” said Tom Haas, general chair of the NJ Transit union. “This agreement gives us the pay raises we needed, but also was done without a major hit to NJT’s budget and should not require a fare hike for passengers.”
The union’s ratification of the new contract means the likely end of the yearslong contract dispute. The NJ Transit board needs to approve the deal before it is finalized. The board meets next on Wednesday morning.
NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri said in a statement that the new contract balances “fair compensation with budgetary discipline.”
“We adhered to the established bargaining pattern and, through constructive negotiations, secured meaningful concessions that enabled us to fund the wage increases sought by BLET members without exceeding our current budget,” Kolluri said.
The union and NJ Transit committed to a deal in March but the union’s members overwhelmingly rejected it, setting the stage for last month’s disruptive strike.
Locomotive engineers had sought larger pay raises than were offered to the agency’s other unions under a process called pattern bargaining, where different unions are offered contracts with identical terms. Members of the train engineers union, they said, were paid less than locomotive engineers at other rail lines in the region.
The agency resisted, warning larger increases would trigger provisions in existing collective bargaining agreements — so-called “me, too” provisions — and guarantee equivalent raises to most of NJ Transit’s 14 other unions.
Late in the bargaining process, Haas said engineers offered concessions on health care benefits and work rules that would allow larger raises without triggering those clauses. The union never detailed those proposals publicly, and it’s not clear whether they are included in the ratified agreement.
It was not immediately clear whether other unions would seek to enforce “me, too” provisions.
Because rail strikes can significantly disrupt interstate commerce, they are heavily regulated at the federal level, and workers in that industry must go through extensive mediation processes before they can launch a job action.
For the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, that process included years before the National Mediation Board, two presidential emergency boards, and years of direct negotiation.
The engineer strike last month entirely stopped NJ Transit trains for four days, forcing the agency to increase bus service to transport roughly one-fifth of the agency’s rail riders at a cost of about $4 million each day.

Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file photo)The Georgia Supreme Court has permanently blocked four rules the State Election Board approved last fall, concluding Tuesday that members of the board exceeded their authority in attempting to implement rules that went beyond the scope of Georgia’s election laws.
A total of seven rules were approved by the Republican-led board ahead of the 2024 general election, with supporters claiming that the changes were necessary to ensure accuracy and restore public confidence in Georgia’s election integrity.
If enacted, the rules would have ordered poll workers to hand count all ballots cast on election day, made it easier for local election officials to delay certifying election results and required family members and caregivers to present a photo ID when dropping off absentee ballots on behalf of another voter, among other changes. Election officials and voting rights groups opposed the rules, arguing that last-minute changes could sow confusion and doubt into the election process, and that implementing the new rules would violate Georgia’s election laws.   
Last October, the Georgia Republican Party and Republican National Committee filed an emergency motion urging the state Supreme Court to reinstate the rules ahead of the general election, but the court declined to expedite their appeal. 
In a 96-page opinion, Chief Justice Nels Peterson upheld most of the Fulton County Superior Court’s ruling, declaring that the State Election Board “can pass rules to implement and enforce the Election Code, but it cannot go beyond, change, or contradict” existing Georgia law. The October ruling from Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr. argued that the seven rules were “illegal, unconstitutional and void,” and that the State Election Board had exceeded its authority by passing them.
However, in a slight reversal of the lower court ruling, the state Supreme Court allowed a rule mandating video surveillance of ballot drop boxes to take effect, finding that the rule was consistent with current election laws.
Two other rules that would have expanded mandatory poll-watching areas and required election workers to publicly post daily totals of early and absentee voters were sent back to the Fulton County Superior Court for further consideration.

The State Election Board is tasked with writing rules to ensure that elections run smoothly and hearing complaints about alleged violations. The three most conservative members of the Republican-led board — Janice Johnston, former state Sen. Rick Jeffares and Janelle King — made national headlines last fall after approving seven election rules in spite of Attorney General Chris Carr’s warnings that the changes likely would not stand up in court. Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump also praised King, Jeffares and Johnston during a campaign rally in Atlanta for supporting changes to election certification rules, calling them “pit bulls” for “victory.” 
State Election Board Chairman John Fervier did not respond to a request for comment on the Supreme Court’s ruling.
The ACLU of Georgia, which helped represent the plaintiffs, applauded Tuesday’s ruling. 
“This is a resounding affirmation of voters’ rights,” said Theresa Lee, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Voting Rights Project. “The court recognized what we’ve argued all along — that this rule was unlawful and entirely unnecessary. Today’s decision safeguards not just the letter of Georgia election law, but the democratic principle that every vote must be counted accurately and without interference.”
Eternal Vigilance Action, a conservative election advocacy organization that sued the State Election Board over the rule changes, also celebrated the ruling.
“This ruling makes clear: the legislative power belongs to the General Assembly, not executive agencies operating without proper constraints,” Eternal Vigilance Action founder and former Republican state Rep. Scot Turner said in a statement. 
As new election laws passed in 2024 begin to take effect, including a ban on the use of QR codes to tabulate ballots, the board will likely continue to draft rules to guide local election officials tasked with implementing the changes. However, this year the board is workshopping changes to the rulemaking process in the hopes of avoiding a repeat of the chaos that defined the 2024 election cycle.
During a May meeting, state election board members discussed the possibility of forming a rules committee with election directors, legislators, Georgia residents, and election law attorneys. Rules would be vetted by the committee before being presented to the full board.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Senate has refused to refer a bill targeting diversity, equity and inclusion to a committee where it could be debated, an unusual move that essentially means the proposal will die on the vine. 
House Bill 685 by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, would have banned DEI practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curricula for undergraduate students. It narrowly passed the House last month after a hours-long debate in which Black lawmakers called the bill “racially oppressive.” 
“We couldn’t figure out which committee to refer it to,” Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said Monday in an interview.  
Chenevert said she was disappointed her bill didn’t get a Senate committee hearing, adding she would consider sponsoring the legislation again in the future. 
“Sometimes it’s not about getting all the way through,” Chenevert said. “Maybe it’s just bringing up the topic and having some … open conversations about it.” 
The legislation was originally debated in the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, because its original version only prohibited DEI practices in state agencies. During that hearing, it was amended to restrict college curricula but it was not sent to the House Committe on Education, which handles proposals on curricula and higher education. 
“To the extent the bill intended to prohibit the inclusion of certain concepts which are unrelated to specific courses or programs it would be unnecessary as professional best practices already set that standard,” LSU Faculty Senate President Dan Tirone said in a statement to the Illuminator. 
House Bill 685 was introduced in the Senate on May 20, with more than three weeks left in the legislative session during which it could have been debated in committee, a necessary step before it can get a Senate floor vote. But as the final week of committee meetings passed, Chenevert’s proposal remained unreferred. 
“I think it’s unnecessary,” Henry said, adding it was the Senate’s decision, not just his, to stall the bill. “An enormous amount of people from both parties expressed their reservations.” 
Chenevert’s bill had the support of Gov. Jeff Landry. 
“If the governor wants to institute that, he can do an executive order,” Henry said of the legislation. 
If it had become law, the bill would have prohibited required classes that cover any of the following subjects: 

Critical race theory
White fragility or white guilt
Systemic racism, institutional racism or anti-racism
Systemic bias or implicit bias 
Intersectionality
Gender identity
Allyship
Race-based reparations
Race-based privilege

The legislation would have allowed any of the subjects to be taught if it was “included at the discretion of the faculty member, is not prescribed by the institution as a program requirement, and is part of a broader pedagogical objective.” 
Opponents of the bill said even with this language, the legislation could have had a chilling effect on faculty’s academic freedom and freedom of speech. 
The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to lawmakers asking them to oppose the bill. 
“This legislation would stifle the ‘marketplace of ideas’ and infantilize our students, forcing faculty to avoid concepts the legislature dislikes and presenting only those that have gained their favor,” the letter reads. “This is antithetical to freedom in a democratic society and hurts our students as they transition into fully enfranchised citizens.” 
The Southern University Foundation, which is affiliated with Louisiana’s largest historically Black  university, also opposed the bill.

The complaint was filed with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission on behalf of Mortimer Adramelech, minister of Satan of the Iowa congregation of The Satanic Temple, against the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, its director, and the office of Gov. Kim Reynolds.
The complaint alleges the state illegally discriminated on the basis of religion in denying The Satanic Temple Iowa’s application to hold a winter celebration event in the Iowa Capitol’s rotunda in December 2024.

The complaint alleges the denial was in retaliation for The Satanic Temple Iowa’s three prior reports of discrimination.

Adramelech said Tuesday that state officials made a number of assumptions about his religion and used those assumptions to discriminate against his congregation. “We are compassionate and caring human beings,” he said. “We have families. We are Iowans and we are simply seeking to exercise our right to freedom of religion.”
The temple’s application to use the Capitol rotunda specified that planned events would be family-friendly and appropriate for children. The events were to include a ritual, a costume contest, caroling, coloring and make-and-take ornaments.
The complaint alleges in denying the application, the state wrongly alleged the celebration would have included sex acts, gore, and similar content and was not suitable for minors.
In a written statement, Reynolds said that while the Capitol building is open to the public, the state’s event policy “takes into consideration conduct that would be harmful to minors.” Reynolds said the proposed winter celebration, “which specifically targeted children, would have been harmful to children and so (the application) was denied.”
ACLU of Iowa Legal Director Rita Bettis Austen said Tuesday that “it’s one of the foundational principles of our country, and our state civil rights law, that the government should not favor one religious viewpoint or belief over another, or treat its citizens worse or better based on their religion. That means, among other things, that when the government makes the public space in the State Capitol available for other religious groups to use, for example, a Christmas or Hanukkah holiday display, it cannot then legally deny the same right to other religious groups, and that includes our clients.”
Once a complaint is filed with the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, the commission may choose to investigate and act as a mediator in the dispute. After 60 days, the party filing the complaint has the option of pulling the complaint and requesting a “right to sue” letter, allowing them to seek a resolution in district court.
The civil rights complaint is a separate proceeding from the lawsuit the ACLU of Iowa filed in April on behalf of the Iowa Atheists and Freethinkers. That lawsuit seeks to compel the governor’s office to produce public records regarding the denial of the temple’s application for its 2024 winter celebration. That litigation is still pending.

A potential sixth contender, and the only independent candidate for the race, Stephen Tocco, withdrew his declaration of candidacy on Monday, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State, confirmed in an email.
Tocco, a retired chief of Rhode Island Capitol Police and former Smithfield Town Council member, said he decided to withdraw after seeing the number and quality of other candidates.
“I figured, why become a spoiler and hurt one of the two candidates in the general election,”  Tocco said in an interview Tuesday.  “I might have gotten 6-10% and that could have hurt either candidate. I didn’t want to do that. We need good people out there in the public arena.
The seat spanning parts of North Providence and Providence became vacant after the death of Senate President Dominick Ruggerio on April 21. Ruggerio, a Democrat, had held the seat since 1984.
The four Democratic candidates seeking the seat will compete in a primary election on July 8. Candidate Stefano Famiglietti, a North Providence City Councilor, will appear first on the ballot, having secured the endorsement of the Senate District 4 Democratic Committee. 
The Secretary of State’s Elections Division will hold a lottery Wednesday to determine the order in which the remaining candidates will appear on the primary ballot. They are Lenny Cioe, a registered nurse; former state Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell; and Manny Taveras, brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras. 
The lottery will also decide the order of the Republican or Democratic Party candidates on the general election ballot.
As the only Republican candidate, Alexander Asermely, a lawyer, automatically advances to the Aug. 5 general special election. 
The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026.  State lawmakers are paid $19,817 a year. 
The registration deadline for the July primary was Sunday, July 8. Registered voters have until June 17 to apply for a mail ballot. Early voting runs from June 18 to July 7. 
More information for candidates and voters is available online.

Asthma affects more than 4.6 million American children, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It’s one of the most common long-term diseases in U.S. children.
The Make America Healthy Again Commission report released in late May, parts of which have been widely criticized, alleges that American children are on too much medication of various kinds, including asthma treatments.
Experts worry that the administration will set policy based on the assessment that would dissuade insurers from covering asthma prescriptions. They also say that the report’s assertions could worsen disparities that affect children’s access to those medications and undermine years of research around the drugs.

The MAHA commission has until August to release a strategy based on the findings in the report.
Black and Indigenous children as well as those living in inner cities or in lower-income households are among those with the highest rates of asthma. Pollution disproportionately shrouds communities of color and can be a trigger that exacerbates the disease.
The report’s message could heighten those disparities, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a University of Texas at Austin professor and a past chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Section on Allergy and Immunology.
“One thing that has been very clear is that kids of color are less likely to be appropriately managed in terms of their asthma medication management,” she said. “So a message of overprescription that is simply not supported by the evidence also could potentially exacerbate already-existing racial and ethnic disparities in asthma that we have really not made much headway on.”

The commission’s claims

The report touches on childhood prediabetes, obesity and mental health. However, firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the CDC — weren’t mentioned.
The 70-page report from the commission, chaired by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., claims four main issues are the drivers behind childhood chronic disease: poor diet, aggregation of environmental chemicals, lack of physical activity and chronic stress, and “overmedicalization.”
Matsui and other experts said the report’s use of that word is “problematic.”
“The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma — so, they have coughing, chest tightness, wheezing — that that is not really a disease,” said Matsui. “We know for a fact that that’s a disease, and we know that it is quite treatable, quite controllable, and that it has profound impacts on the child’s day-to-day life.”
Other scientists have similarly criticized the report, saying it makes sweeping and misleading generalizations about children’s health without sufficient evidence. The White House corrected the report after nonprofit news outlet NOTUS found that it cited studies that didn’t exist.
In an emailed statement to Stateline, Health and Human Services press secretary Emily Hilliard wrote: “The MAHA report discusses concerns about the potential overprescription of asthma medications—particularly in mild cases—not to question their importance, but to encourage evidence-based prescribing.”
When it comes to asthma, the report says, “Asthma controller prescriptions increased 30% from 1999-2008.” That sentence originally cited a broken link to a study from 2011; the link was later replaced. Controller meds include inhalers.
The MAHA report also claims that “There is evidence of overprescription of oral corticosteroids for mild cases of asthma.” The original version of the report listed estimated percentages of oral corticosteroids overuse, citing a nonexistent study. The wording was changed and the citation was later replaced with a link to a 2017 study by pediatric pulmonologist Dr. Harold Farber.
The study was not a randomized controlled trial, which increases reliability. Farber  told NOTUS that the report made an “overgeneralization” of his research. Stateline also reached out to Farber, whose public relations team declined an interview request.










The implication could be, unfortunately, that when a child has asthma … that that is not really a disease. We know for a fact that that's a disease.


– Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, University of Texas at Austin professor


Oral corticosteroids are liquid or tablet medications used to reduce inflammation for conditions including allergies, asthma, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. For asthma, they’re used to treat severe flare-up episodes. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America says the medications have been shown to reduce emergency room visits and hospitalizations, and that while they do come with risk of side effects, they’re mostly used in acute flare-ups. And while rare, asthma-related deaths in kids do occur, and are often preventable.
“Asthma medications, including oral steroids, are lifesaving,” said Dr. Elizabeth Friedman, a pediatrician at Children’s Mercy Kansas City. “I believe that physicians, not politicians, are best equipped and most effectively trained to make the determination of whether or not these medications are needed for our patients.”
Friedman worries that federal characterizations of asthma meds will affect how state Medicaid agencies cover the drugs. When Medicaid coverage changed for a common prescribed inhaler last year, many of her Missouri Medicaid patients were suddenly without the drug. They ended up hospitalized, she said.
Friedman directs Region 7 of the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units, a network of experts that works to address reproductive and children’s environmental health issues. Region 7 provides outreach and education in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.
She also said she’s concerned that the report is “making a broad, sweeping statement based on one epidemiologic study from one state.”

Increased use

An increase in inhaler prescriptions is not necessarily a bad thing, experts say. It’s a sign that kids are getting their medication.
There has been an increase in inhaler prescriptions, along with a corresponding decrease in the oral corticosteroids, which is what experts would want to see, said Chelsea Langer, bureau chief of the New Mexico Department of Health’s Environmental Health Epidemiology Bureau. She said that means kids are “following their asthma action plans and taking the controller medications to prevent needing the relief or treatment [oral] meds.”

Asthma prevalence has increased over the years, meaning more people need medication, noted Dr. Alan Baptist, division head of Allergy and Clinical Immunology at Henry Ford Health in Michigan.
He said that because steroid tablets come with risk of side effects, it is best to limit them.
But for kids without access to a regular pediatric provider or to health insurance that covers an inhaler, cost can be an obstacle, he said. Fluticasone propionate, an FDA-approved medicine for people 4 and older, costs on average $200 or more for one inhaler without insurance.
“What often happens with kids, and especially kids who are in Medicaid, or who are in an underserved or disadvantaged population, they are not given appropriate asthma controller medication,” said Baptist, who helped write federal guidelines for asthma treatment best practices as part of a National Institutes of Health committee.
Baptist noted that while he was glad to see pollution mentioned in the report as a danger for kids, it’s at odds with the recent cuts to environmental health grants that aimed to address such asthma triggers.
“They’re somewhat cherry-picking some of the data that they’re putting down,” he said. “It says the U.S. government is ‘committed to fostering radical transparency and gold-standard science’ to better understand the potential cumulative impacts of environmental exposure. If that’s what they’re saying, then they should be funding even greater studies that look at the effects.”
Dr. Priya Bansal, an Illinois pediatric allergist and immunologist and past president of the Illinois Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, said she’s concerned the report doesn’t define mild, moderate or severe asthma to differentiate the different best-practice treatment plans.
Bansal also said she worries that federal officials’ characterization of an FDA-approved drug will lead to insurance companies refusing to cover inhalers or oral steroids for her patients who rely on them.
“I’m going to be worried about coverage for my asthmatics,” she said. “The question is, what’s the next move that they’re going to make? If they think that, are they going to now say, ‘Hey, we’re not going to cover inhalers for mild asthmatics’?”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Organizations from around the country signed a letter on Monday urging U.S. senators not to include a controversial proposal to sell thousands of acres of federal land in Congress’ budget bill.
The letter, signed by 113 groups including the Idaho Conservation League, comes in the wake of reports that U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is considering reviving an amendment to the bill originally proposed by U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, that would dispose of nearly 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah and about 450,000 acres in Nevada.
Lee, when asked by a Politico reporter last week if he intended to reintroduce the disposal, responded, “I gotta go vote, but yes.”
Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday, and it’s unclear whether Utah’s senior GOP senator is considering bringing back an exact copy of Maloy’s amendment, or something different.
But more than 100 organizations and nonprofits around the country are sounding the alarm, telling Senate leaders to “heed how dramatically unpopular this idea is and reject any misguided attempt to get public lands sales back in this bill.”
“Decisions about the future of public lands should remain in public hands,” the letter states. “Leaders in the House and Senate, extractive industry, and private developers are using the reconciliation process to sell off federal lands to pay for billionaire tax cuts. But such moves are deeply unpopular. Polling has repeatedly shown that the public — especially Westerners — strongly believes in keeping public lands in public hands and, across partisan lines, rejects any efforts that would lead to the sale of these shared and cherished lands.”
Long-thwarted efforts to sell public lands see new life under Trump

The letter is addressed to Lee, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee; New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich, the committee’s ranking member; Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican; and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.
Maloy’s amendment was dropped from the budget bill after it received pushback from all sides of the aisle. That includes Montana Republican U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross and rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip the proposal from the bill.
“The public had no opportunity to participate in the process of identifying these parcels, let alone time to understand the long-term effect of selling off these public lands,” the letter reads.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Utah’s Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.

Congressional cuts to federal rental aid have prompted Vermont’s largest housing authorities to stop issuing new Section 8 vouchers. The state’s nine local housing agencies estimate they need to shelve nearly 1,000 vouchers from their rolls by the end of the year.

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
There was a moment last fall, a few months after moving into her new three-bedroom apartment, when Hannah Patten felt like she was finally at home. 
The 37-year-old single mom had been homeless with her two middle-school-aged children for ten months after Patten left her ex-husband, who she said was abusive. The family of three secured the rental with a short-term housing voucher last June. When Halloween came around, her kids rolled their eyes at making jack-o’-lanterns, but they indulged her. Patten had the sensation that she was watching the scene from above.
“It was just really nice to sit around the table and carve pumpkins and just … be free like that,” she said. “That’s the best way to explain it – is free. We’re just free, we’re happy, we’re healthy, we’re secure.”
Patten’s temporary rental aid from the state – slated to end this summer – was intended to act as a bridge toward long-term federal assistance. She had banked on obtaining a Section 8 voucher to help her family stay put. Patten wanted to remain in the apartment to see her kids graduate high school. 
She had gone through round after round of applications with the Vermont State Housing Authority, advancing her status over the course of months. By May, it seemed like she would be granted her ticket to permanent security any day.
But late last month, she got a phone call that rocked her. Patten’s caseworker told her that the housing authority was putting her back on their waitlist – and she had little chance of getting off of it. A recent federal funding reduction meant the housing authority had halted issuing new vouchers. Hers had been on the brink of getting rubber-stamped, a letter from the Vermont State Housing Authority later confirmed.
As the news sank in, Patten burst into tears. She had dutifully submitted each and every document required of her. She had spent months scouring rental listings to find this apartment. So much had to go right to get here, and now, it was unravelling.
“I am doing anything and everything,” Patten said. “Then you’re just … you’re giving it to me and then taking it right away.” 
No new vouchers
The nine housing authorities that administer federal rental vouchers in Vermont are reacting to a collective loss of roughly $11 million for the remainder of 2025. That cut is the result of three factors: a recent funding reduction from Congress, the absence of a typical inflation boost to keep up with rising rents, and a clawing back of reserve funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that could have been used to support more vouchers, according to Kathleen Berk, executive director of the Vermont State Housing Authority. 
The result: the state’s largest housing authorities have ceased issuing new vouchers off their lengthy waitlists, and have rescinded vouchers from 144 households who had been searching for a place to use them.
Most of the eight regional housing authorities in the state – along with the Vermont State Housing Authority, which covers areas that don’t have a local agency – are now attempting to shrink the number of vouchers on their rolls by not reissuing them when tenants give them up.
Cumulatively, the nine agencies estimate that they will need to shelve 991 vouchers by the end of 2025 to get within budget, according to data aggregated by the Vermont State Housing Authority. That amounts to about 14% of the 7,122 vouchers in use as of late May.
“It’s dramatic,” Berk said. “We’re trying to solve an affordability housing crisis, while at the same time, Congress continues to not adequately fund one of the most basic successful programs that [the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] has ever made available to low income folks across the country.”
Over half of Vermont renters are considered cost-burdened. Federal housing vouchers are one of the state’s most critical tools to help move people out of homelessness and sustain housing for Vermonters who struggle to afford market-rate rents. Section 8 voucher recipients pay a third of their income toward rent; a local agency administering the federal program pays for the rest. 
While the recent funding cuts are largely the result of budget decisions made by Congress, the Trump administration has signaled its desire to see steeper reductions to federal rental aid and new time constraints and work requirements for tenants who receive it.
A motel to a home
For Patten, losing her shot at a voucher undid nearly two years of effort to gain stability. 
In September of 2023, Patten and her two children fled their home, after she had endured physical assaults from her former partner for about six months, she said. Before that, Patten had served as his caretaker following an injury; the family relied on state support. Soon after Patten and the kids left, the family entered the state’s motel voucher system. The family moved from motel to motel; Patten’s kids switched from school to school. (VTDigger/Vermont Public are not including Patten’s location to protect her safety.)
All the while, Patten sent in applications to housing programs, a task that amounted to its own job. She broke down in the lobby of a Motel 6 when her caseworker informed her that she had been granted a year-long housing voucher through a little-known program administered by the state’s Department for Children and Families – meant to tide her over to longer-term aid.
“I started bawling right in the middle of the motel, because it was like – I’m almost there,” she said.
But she still needed to find an apartment where she could use the subsidy, a task that took another four months, since the unit needed to be big enough for her family and was required to rent for under $1,400 a month. Available rentals are so scarce in Vermont that the majority of people who do secure a Section 8 voucher – roughly 60% – end up forfeiting the help because they cannot find a suitable apartment before their time runs out.
Finally, a landlord Patten met through an online listing offered to lower the price of a roomy three-bedroom apartment so it would fit within her allotted budget. He also offered her a job at a local business, where she still picks up a few shifts each week. Patten rented a U-Haul and moved in a few weeks later.
Now, a year onward, she’s faced with the prospect of moving out.

A bottleneck
The federal cuts to Section 8 have begun to send ripple effects through Vermont’s homelessness response system.
Earlier this spring, Patten secured an extension on her short-term voucher, which is now slated to expire in August. The Department for Children and Families has historically awarded more time when recipients of its 12-month Vermont Rental Subsidy program have appeared on the brink of securing longer-term help, according to Miranda Gray, the deputy commissioner of DCF’s economic services division. 
Further extensions now appear unlikely.
“We need to see what makes the most sense – understanding that there might be bigger barriers,” Gray said. “It’s not just a matter of if they need a little more time to get through the process.”
DCF has already shifted its internal policy around the program, in light of the Section 8 cuts. In late May, the Department stopped granting new short-term rental vouchers, Gray said, because officials do not know whether they will be able to bridge the 60 households currently in the program to long-term assistance.
She worries that the Section 8 funding reduction will tighten a bottleneck in the state’s efforts to house Vermonters experiencing homelessness.
“It’s just going to add strain to a system that is already really strained,” she said.
A chance to dream
When Patten moved into the apartment a year ago, she set herself a goal. Within two years, she’d be off state assistance – she’d have landed a job that would allow her to cover the rent herself. After that, she imagined buying land and building herself a house.
“This apartment gave me the chance to kind of dream of our futures and what it could be,” she said, sitting in her living room on a late spring afternoon. “And that’s all gone now.”
As the end of August creeps closer, Patten worries that she will need to again seek a state-funded motel room to assure her family’s shelter – if one is available. A motel voucher would come at significantly greater expense to the state than the DCF subsidy that helps pay for the rental. 
“To me, it’s going to be a very gloomy summer,” she said.
But there was a shred of hope to hang onto. As a reporter packed up her car, Patten ran down to the sidewalk. She had just received a call for a job interview. A position with the state, to help families like hers navigate the byzantine benefits programs meant to offer them stability.
Maybe it could deliver the security she sought.

The bill would have also made it more difficult for employees across the state to hold a vote to decertify an existing union.

Gov. Phil Scott on Monday vetoed legislation that would have granted supervisors in Vermont’s judiciary system the right to form a union.
“The Judiciary has advised this change could have a negative impact on the effective management of courthouses and fear a workplace marked by divisiveness and angst were this bill to pass,” Scott wrote in a letter to the Legislature about his veto of S.125. 
“At a time when our court system is managing a significant backlog, we should be focusing on improving efficiencies within the system,” he continued. 
The bill passed the Senate in a voice vote with apparently widespread support. In the House, however, the legislation received only 81 votes, with 51 against. The vote was largely along party lines, though not entirely, with the chamber’s three independents and most Republicans voting ‘nay.’ Although roughly a dozen Democrats were absent for that vote, it appears unlikely that the chamber now could reach the 100-vote threshold that would be necessary to override the governor’s veto. 
If the bill had been signed, it’s unclear exactly how many state employees would have been allowed to unionize. In committee testimony throughout the legislative session, Vermont judiciary branch administrators, who strongly opposed the bill, maintained that the state has just four judiciary supervisors.
According to Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees’ Association, the number could actually be far greater. The VSEA would have represented the new bargaining unit.
“We seriously doubt that management’s estimate of four positions is accurate,” Howard said. “We’re suspicious that the reason that they’re so opposed to a supervisory unit is that we’re going to find that there are a number of positions that they consider non-supervisory which really are supervisory.”
If the change in law had been adopted and supervisory staff had in fact petitioned to unionize under the VSEA, Howard said, it’s likely the union and leaders of the Vermont Judiciary would have spent months debating the scope of the unit before the Vermont Labor Relations Board, which would have final say on which employees could join. 
The bill also contained a provision that would have made it harder for employees across Vermont to oust an existing union in their workplace. 
As the rules currently stand, 30% of union membership have to sign a petition to hold a decertification vote, which would decide whether to dismantle an existing union. 
The bill would have raised that threshold to 50% plus one member, requiring a majority of workers to petition for a decertification vote. Conversely, 30% of employees need to support a petition to hold a vote to form a union, an amount that would not have been changed by the legislation. 
“This bill seeks to make it harder for employees, if they choose, to seek union representation from other organizations,” Scott said in his letter. “I believe the threshold to trigger a vote for certification should be the same as decertification.”

,DC,2025-06-10 19:47:40+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,States’ moves to curb cellphone use in schools highlighted in U.S. House hearing,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/states-moves-curb-cellphone-use-schools-highlighted-us-house-hearing,,"WASHINGTON — Concerns over the use of cellphones in classrooms took center stage Tuesday at a hearing in a U.S. House education panel, as an increasing number of states push to ban or restrict the use of cellphones and other electronic devices during instruction time. Though lawmakers from both parties acknowledged the harms that excessive cellphone use can create for students, whether affecting their well-being, interpersonal skills or attention in class, Democrats also criticized the Trump administration’s cancellation earlier this year of roughly $1 billion in school mental health grants amid broader efforts to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.The drive at the state level to curb cellphone use in the classroom has been bipartisan.In 2025 so far, the governors of states such as Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia have already signed laws that put bans in place.“Screens are now pervasive, mostly in the form of students’ cellphones, drawing attention away from interactive discussion and instruction,” said Rep. Kevin Kiley, chair of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, during the panel’s hearing. The subcommittee is part of the Education and Workforce Committee.“Too often, students spend most of their days with their heads down, thumbs scrolling and only a fraction interacting with increasingly discouraged teachers,” the California Republican said.New Utah lawOne witness, Rich Nye, senior adviser for education policy to Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, touted the bill Cox signed earlier this year, which “prohibits a student from using a cellphone, smart watch, or emerging technology during classroom hours.”The statewide ban, which allows for certain exemptions, is set to take effect July 1.Prior to the bill becoming law, Cox had sent letters to district and charter school leaders, school principals, school community council members and the State Board of Education in 2024 urging educators to remove cellphones during class time, noting that “cellphone-free learning environments will help our teachers teach and our students learn.”Utah GOP Rep. Burgess Owens applauded his state’s efforts.“Technology can often be a force multiplier in the workforce, however, we need to better understand the implications when we expose our children to digital devices, and what the long-term effects might be,” he said.Dems blast massive cuts to mental health grantsMeanwhile, Democrats took aim at the administration’s decision this year to stop funding approximately $1 billion in grants for student mental health services through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022.Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, ranking member of the subcommittee, said “these programs ended without notice to states and without recourse to help students who depend on them.”“The grants provided funding for mental health professionals, for support services, for suicide prevention resources, for schools in districts that desperately need them,” the Oregon Democrat said.Cheryl Holcomb-McCoy, president and CEO of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, emphasized to lawmakers the need to restore the grants.Holcomb-McCoy said the termination of the grants “has left districts and teachers and principals and superintendents without the critical support they need for students in crisis, particularly those affected by excessive screen time.”“I also note that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and officials in the administration often say that the federal government should not be making decisions for local schools,” Bonamici said. “As with curriculum decisions, technology policies should be managed by state and local officials.”Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Summer Lee said the cancellation of the grants makes her wonder how “Republicans are going to ask us to have a genuine conversation about harmful effects of screen time in schools when they’re enabling the administration to dismantle the Department of Education and any support structures that we have for schools, program by program, nickel and dime.”Trump and his administration have sought to dramatically reshape the federal role in education, including an executive order calling on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department, the gutting of more than 1,300 employees at the agency, threats to revoke funds for schools that use diversity, equity and inclusion practices and a crackdown on “woke” higher education.But federal judges have temporarily blocked many of these efforts.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Main photo courtesy Wright County Assessor's Office; inset photo from federal court filings)An Iowa industrial egg supplier is denying allegations that it engaged in human trafficking or threatened immigrant workers with deportation in retaliation for their complaints.
In March, attorneys for six Guatemalan citizens sued Iowa’s Centrum Valley Farms and company manager Jose Cornejo in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The plaintiffs, all of whom lived in Belmond, Eagle Grove, Clarion or Webster City while working for Centrum Valley Farms, seeks unspecified damages for harassment, discrimination and retaliation; wrongful discharge; human trafficking related to forced labor; violations of wage-and-hour laws related to overtime pay, and violations of the federal Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.
The plaintiffs — Kenny Augusto Tetzaguic Lux, Gerver Noel Marroquin Argueta, Isaias Tevalan Lopez, Consuelo Esperanza Lux Tepaz, Cecilia Angelica Bernal Cobo and Juan Carlos Tetzaguic Lux – claim Centrum Valley Farms recruited them to work at the company’s Clarion egg farm and packaging facility and helped them obtain work-authorization documents from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, with Cornejo acting as their supervisor.
On a daily basis, Cornejo, who is Mexican, made “repeated unwelcome comments disparaging the plaintiffs for their Guatemalan national origin,” the lawsuit claims. Cornejo is accused of telling the plaintiffs all Guatemalans were lazy and that he wanted to replace them with Mexicans or Americans.
When the Guatemalans complained about Cornejo to other managers, the lawsuit claims, the harassment allegedly grew worse with Cornejo threatening to have them deported. “Cornejo even brought a firearm to work, showed it to the plaintiffs, and displayed it in his office to intimidate the plaintiffs and silence their complaints,” the lawsuit claims.
Cornejo also is accused of threatening to turn the Guatemalans in to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement if they tried to voluntarily leave their positions at the company. The company eventually terminated the Guatemalans’ employment “in retaliation for their complaints,” the lawsuit adds.
On Jan. 25, 2023, Cornejo allegedly brought a firearm to his office and displayed it on his desk to intimidate Lux and the other Guatemalans, according to the lawsuit. One of the other plaintiffs alleges Cornejo referred to him as his “faithful dog,” his “slave” and as his “Guatemalan wetback,” while making him apply pesticides in chicken houses without the necessary protective equipment.
In response to the lawsuit, Centrum Valley Farms has denied any wrongdoing and claimed more than a dozen affirmative defenses.
For example, the company alleges the plaintiffs failed to take advantage of corrective or preventative opportunities to avoid any harm, and that the Guatemalans’ claims of harassment are barred because the workers cannot show that any such conduct was so severe or pervasive that it affected their employment.
To the extent that any discriminatory or retaliatory conduct was committed by an employee of Centrum Valley Farms, the company states, the conduct fell outside the scope of the employee’s authority and was contrary to Centrum Valley Farm’s “good-faith efforts to comply with state and federal law.”
A trial date has yet to be scheduled.

The settlement comes more than two years after a gunman opened fire at the university, killing three students and injuring five.
In a statement, law firms Grewal Law and Gruel Mills Nims & Pylman said the settlements – totaling $29.75 million – would bring closure to at least some of the survivors.
Nathan Statly was shot in the head, resulting in brain injuries requiring extensive medical treatment and ongoing care. He will receive $14.25 million.
Yukai “John” Hao was left paralyzed from the chest down after being struck by a bullet in his back. Hao will receive $13 million, with the university agreeing to waive tuition, room and board, and provide health insurance throughout the completion of his undergraduate and graduate degrees.
Troy Forbush was shot in the chest and suffered a serious lung injury, requiring surgery and extensive rehabilitative therapy. He will receive $2.5 million.
“Grewal Law and Gruel Mills Nims & Pylman are honored to assist in obtaining justice for these remarkable young men,” the firms said in a statement.
In response, university spokesperson Amber McCann offered condolences to the students injured in the shooting, as well as their families and loved ones.
“While the university cannot comment on any specific settlements, we truly hope reaching a resolution helps provide some measure of relief, support and care to impacted individuals and their families,” McCann said.

Free speech and good government advocates are concerned officials could use the law, which will take effect unless the governor vetoes the proposal, to silence critics, punish journalists and keep unfavorable information out of the public’s hands.     
Last week, the legislature gave final approval to House Bill 681 by Rep. Marcus Bryant, D-New Iberia, after Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, added last-minute amendments to include statewide elected officials, members of the Public Service Commission and state lawmakers under an existing state law that shields their personal information from being made public. 
The amended version of the bill passed the Senate on a 36-0 vote and the House on an 89-0 vote. 
The law prevents the elected officials’ home addresses, phone numbers, personal email addresses, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, federal tax identification numbers, bank account numbers, credit and debit card numbers, license plate numbers from being published in government records or on a public website. Also protected under the law are marital records and birthdates. 
An official’s church, the school or daycare their child attends and the employment location of their spouse, children or dependents would also be shielded. 
“It’s incredibly concerning and broad … in a way I cannot describe because I don’t yet know how bad it’s going to be,” said attorney Scott Sternberg, who works on First Amendment cases, adding that such prosecutions would likely be unconstitutional. 
If Gov. Jeff Landry allows the proposal to become law, the newly included elected officials could request their personal information be removed from public records. It could also be used to force someone to remove an online post with personal information about the elected officials. 
For example, the law could be wielded against somebody who raises concerns about conflicts of interest pertaining to the employment of an elected official’s spouse or child. 
If that person does not comply, they can be sued and face misdemeanor charges that carry up to 90 days in prison, a $1,000 fine or both. 
The bill could allow the sealing of marital records to prevent the public from learning of allegations of abuse in a divorce proceeding. 
“In Louisiana’s constitution … we have decided the people are entitled to certain information, because … the people have learned to check up on the government every now and then,” Sternberg said. 
“Whenever an exception [to public records law] passes … it limits the public’s right to access,” Sternberg added. 
Broadening the scope of the bill without public debate troubles good governance advocates.  
“Slipping such a significant public records exemption into a bill with little acknowledgment and no debate raises questions about what people are trying to hide and undermines transparency,” said Steven Procopio, president of Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana. 
Lawmakers and other individuals involved in Bryant’s legislation have not been willing to say how the last-minute amendments got into the bill. 
“These bills are not mine. I’m just bringing them,” Bryant said in an interview, referring questions to Zach Daniels, executive director of the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, who declined to comment for this report. 
Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple said he asked to have statewide elected officials added to the bill but not state lawmakers or Public Service Commission members. Temple said billboards bearing his home address have been put up around the state, prompting his request.
Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said he did not ask for the amendments but supports them. 
Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, posted on social media he had “no clue” how PSC members were added, adding he did not support the legislation.

(Photo by Jim Obradovich for Iowa Capital Dispatch)A lawsuit accusing Casey’s General Stores and an Iowa Board of Regents member of colluding with others as part of an illegal conspiracy to limit competition at fuel pumps has settled out of court.
The lawsuit was filed 10 weeks ago in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa by a JF Acquisitions, a North Carolina company that builds and installs gasoline pumps found at convenience stores.

The defendants in the case are Seneca Companies, based in Des Moines; OWL Services, a Michigan corporation; and Trive Capital Management, a Texas private equity firm. Although the lawsuit claims Casey’s General Stores and Iowa Board of Regents member JC Risewick are involved in the alleged conspiracy, they are not named as defendants in the case. Risewick is the chief strategy officer for OWL Services and the former owner of Seneca, according to Board of Regents records.
JF Acquisitions alleged Trive has been consolidating the gas-pump distribution and servicing industry throughout the United States. Trive is alleged to have created OWL Services, which the lawsuit calls “a rollup of several fuel-dispenser distribution, installation and service companies.” In 2024, the lawsuit claims, Trive quietly added an OWL competitor, Seneca, to its portfolio and never publicly announced the deal or informed regulators of it due to “obvious competition concerns.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
This lack of disclosure extended to a state conflict-of-interest report filed by Risewick, the Iowa Board of Regents member, the lawsuit claims.
Risewick allegedly disclosed his affiliation with Seneca and OWL, but not with Trive — a “potentially relevant omission given the fact that the University of Iowa Foundation is a limited partner in multiple Trive funds,” the lawsuit claims.
Following Trive’s acquisition of Seneca, the lawsuit claims, the defendants allegedly engaged in “exclusionary and predatory conduct” aimed at cementing their combined market power and diminishing competition in the fuel-dispenser distribution and servicing market in Iowa and southern Illinois. The defendants allegedly did this by entering into what JF Acquisitions called “an unlawful conspiracy — including each of the defendants and Casey’s General Stores, one of JF’s most significant customers nationally and the largest convenience store chain in the Midwest region — pursuant to which Casey’s has agreed with defendants that it will all but entirely boycott JF” in Iowa and southern Illinois.
The lawsuit alleges that as part of the purported conspiracy, Risewick wrote to one fuel-distribution company “in an effort to thwart JF’s entry into the market.” The lawsuit appears to then quote from the Risewick letter, but all of the relevant text was redacted from public view.
The lawsuit also appeared to quote from “private text messages,” including one from the head of procurement for Casey’s to Risewick — although, again, the actual content of the purported text message was redacted from the court filing. Risewick was appointed to the Iowa Board of Regents on June 21, 2022, by Gov. Kim Reynolds. His term expires in 2031.
The lawsuit alleged conspiracy to restrain trade in violation of the Sherman Act, as well as conspiracy to restrain and monopolize trade in violation of state law. The case was recently dismissed after the plaintiffs and defendants filed a joint motion for dismissal stating they had “resolved the claims asserted in this action.”
Although some of the court filings in the case are sealed from public view, it appears the defendants in the case did not file an answer to the lawsuit before the matter was settled.
At the same time that case was settled, a federal lawsuit that Seneca filed against JF Acquisitions and D&H United Fueling Solutions in 2024 was settled. In that case, Seneca claimed it had considered entering into a business agreement with the defendants but the deal fell through. The two defendants were then left with the prospect of heightened competition in the market and, the lawsuit claimed, they “hatched a scheme to attack Seneca’s business” by poaching Seneca employees, despite an alleged no-compete agreement.
JF Acquisitions and D&H United Fueling Solutions denied any wrongdoing in the matter. The case was dismissed late last month after all of the parties filed a motion for dismissal, stating they had executed a settlement agreement resolving all of the claims in the case.

A coalition of environmental groups is saying it’s long past time for the federal agency and local regulators to tighten restrictions and require better emission controls for sources of air pollution.
The Southern Environmental Law Center filed a petition with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 5, asking the EPA to formally recognize that the Memphis metro area is failing to meet federal requirements — a move that would trigger stricter requirements for future air permits.
Ozone — also known as smog — is created when pollutants from cars, industrial plants, power plants and other sources react when exposed to sunlight, according to the EPA. Ozone exposure can damage airways and lead to difficulty breathing. People with asthma, emphysema, or those who spend a lot of time outdoors are particularly at risk, the EPA website states. The American Lung Association gave Shelby County an “F” grade for ozone pollution this year.
Ozone emissions averages have exceeded federal limits for the last two years, marking an increase in emissions since 2020.

The Shelby County Health Department, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment are responsible for enforcing federal Clean Air Act requirements for the greater Memphis area. The SELC, along with partners Memphis Community Against Pollution, Young Gifted and Green and the Sierra Club criticizes the local regulators’ efforts to reduce ozone emissions as inadequate.
“We’ve been trying to work with the local governments to persuade them to do more, and quicker, but they just aren’t taking it seriously enough, so this was really a last resort to us,” SELC Senior Attorney Caroline Cress said. “You know, the data doesn’t lie. We know that it is unhealthy to breathe that air now, and we can’t just sit by and let that continue to get worse.”
The Shelby County Health Department could not be immediately reached for comment.
Four out of five Memphis-area air quality monitors exceed ozone health standard
The EPA set the air quality standard for ozone at 70 parts per billion in 2015. The agency is required to review its standards every five years, but decided not to change the ozone standard in 2020. 
The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee — which acts as an independent advisor to the EPA — issued a report in 2023 recommending that the standard be reduced to 55 to 60 parts per billion “to be protective of public health.” The EPA has not yet changed the standard.
The agency calculates a three-year benchmark figure using data from air monitors to measure compliance with the standard. The Memphis metro area has five air monitors that continuously collect data: three in Shelby County, one in Arkansas and one in Mississippi.
Between 2021 and 2023, two of the Memphis-area monitors exceeded the standard. From 2022 to 2024, four of the five monitors exceeded the standard, with the fifth not far behind.
There is no monitor located in South Memphis, where industrial development has ballooned in recent years. It’s also home to majority Black communities who say they’re being surrounded by industrial pollution.
South Memphis communities have battled pollution for years, organizing in 2021 to stop the development of the Byhalia Pipeline, which would have transported crude oil through historically Black Southwest Memphis neighborhoods. The EPA investigated potential cancer clustering in neighborhoods surrounding the Sterilization Services of Tennessee facility in 2022, but found no evidence of higher concentrations of cancer diagnoses that could be connected to the facility.
The sterilization company uses ethylene oxide, a colorless gas that has been linked to several types of cancer. The company has operated in compliance with EPA regulations, but the federal agency updated its regulations after studies showed the gas is “more harmful to human health than we previously knew,” according to a report published by the Tennessee Department of Health in 2023.
The Shelby County Health Department determines where to place monitors within Shelby County. The department’s 2025 air monitoring network plan indicates that it received funding from the EPA to add a monitoring site in South Memphis, which has been without one for more than a decade. The plan does not include a proposed site, and states a monitor may be placed by late 2025 or 2026.
The department could not be immediately reached for comment on the proposed South Memphis site.
The EPA has authority to review data and declare an area as out of compliance at any time.
“We believe that it really does have an obligation at this point,” Cress said of the EPA. “We are presenting it with its own data that is on its website that shows unequivocally that this area is violating federal standards.”

Should the EPA change the Memphis area’s designation, more stringent air quality permit requirements would impact Elon Musk’s xAI (also known as the Colossus data center in South Memphis), “among many other facilities that are emitting ozone-forming pollution,” Cress said.
The petition alleges that xAI could be the “largest stationary source” of ozone emissions in Shelby County, but because the methane gas-fired turbines being used to power the facility are unpermitted, the facility’s emissions are unknown to the public. 
A representative from xAI could not be immediately reached for comment.
Tennessee Rep. John Gillespie, a Memphis Republican, issued a statement Monday in support of xAI’s Memphis facility, lauding the “hundreds of high-paying jobs” created by the endeavor. 
“Despite what some people would have you believe, xAI is not in the middle of a residential neighborhood,” Gillespie wrote. “Instead, it’s suitably located in the 3,500-acre Frank Pidgeon Industrial Park, a nearly 60-year-old industrial development that many native Memphians refer to as President’s Island.”
“The industrial park has over one thousand acres specifically set apart from any residential areas, making it the perfect location for this technology to operate,” Gillespie wrote.

That’s the highest possible rating for a government entity, indicating the lowest risk for investors.
Along with Utah, 13 other states hold that score with Moody’s, Fitch and S&P Global, three big rating agencies.
“The Aaa issuer rating reflects Utah’s robustly expanding economy, formidable budget reserves, minimal leverage, and exemplary fiscal governance,” the financial firm wrote in the announcement.

Analysts also expect Utah’s demographic trends to continue to drive good revenue performance and diversify the state’s economy, they wrote. In the meantime, the state has “excellent budget flexibility” with low fixed costs from “low leverage from bonded debt, pension liabilities and retiree healthcare.”
However, the state also faces credit challenges, including climbing cost of living prices and diminishing housing affordability, which could slow down the state’s “in-migration” trends in the future. Additionally, catering to more Utahns living in the state means more spending, especially for public education.
And, like in most Western states, Utah’s issues with water supply and drought “can disrupt the economy and drive capital spending,” analysts said.
Gov. Spencer Cox celebrated the news, saying in a release that the rating would allow the state to save taxpayer dollars with low-borrowing costs to fund infrastructure and public services.



Let us know what you think...


 


“These ratings reflect the fact that our hard work is paying off,” Cox said in a statement. “Utah continues to be recognized as one of the best-managed states in the nation because of our commitment to fiscal responsibility and the incredible work of public servants who take that responsibility seriously every day.”
The firm also highlighted that Utah’s score will remain steady since its fiscal and debt management style could allow it to successfully navigate potential economic challenges, while its “judicious” approach to expenses in sectors like education, transportation and health care will make for stronger financial stability.
“We don’t take this kind of recognition for granted,” Cox said. “The recent launch of GRIT and the BUILD Coordination Council reflects our commitment to keep improving by solving problems early and delivering real results for Utahns. A top credit rating is something to be proud of, but it is also a reminder to keep earning that trust every single day.”
Moody’s noted that Utah’s rating could be downgraded if the state departs from its tradition of fiscal and liability management, or if the state reduces its reserves to less than 25% of own-source revenue due to economic downturn or other events.

Senate Bill 50, “Freedom to Carry NC,” would allow individuals who are U.S. citizens, at least 18 years of age, and not otherwise prohibited by law, to carry concealed weapons without applying for a permit.
It’s backed by Republican leadership and would make North Carolina the 30th state to approve of so-called “constitutional carry.” The bill has already cleared the Senate and now heads to the House floor for consideration by the full chamber.
The measure is one of the most contentious topics of the legislative session. While the House Judiciary 2 Committee voted along party lines on the bill last week, Tuesday’s roll call vote highlighted the panel’s disagreement.
Some Republicans, like Rep. Ted Davis of New Hanover, voted against the measure. Others chose not to vote, hinting at their disapproval but unwillingness to deviate from party expectations.
Discussion was short, lasting about 10 minutes. Members of the public were not called upon to testify.
Primary sponsor Sen. Danny Britt (R-Hoke, Robeson, Scotland) presented the bill to the committee.
Rep. Cynthia Ball (D-Wake) expressed worry.
“There are no guardrails for someone who has those convictions to continue to carry, because we’re not requiring anything of them until they get caught,” she said. “That gives me and the people who’ve been reaching out to me great concern, because the guardrails we have, we hope are somewhat helpful, but having none is a problem.”
Ball added that Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is opposed to the legislation in its current form.
Rep. Blair Eddins (R-Alexander, Wilkes) brought up how under current law, an 18-year-old cannot purchase a pistol from a gun store. However, if they were to receive it from their grandfather, they could open carry the weapon anywhere they want to go in the state of North Carolina.
“In every circumstance and scenario that’s been brought before you today in this committee, the gun has already been purchased,” Eddins said. “It simply addresses a way that a law-abiding citizen can carry the gun.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GunsNJ-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo courtesy of Voces de la Frontera)Ramón Morales Reyes, a 54-year-old Mexican-born man living in Milwaukee who was framed for writing a letter threatening President Donald Trump, has been granted a $7,500 bond by an immigration judge. The news came early Tuesday morning, as immigrant rights advocates from Voces de la Frontera held a press conference to call on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to clear Morales Reyes’ name, and issue a retraction of a press release denouncing him for threatening the president’s life. 
Morales Reyes’ daughter Anna joined Voces executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz on the press call and became emotional at the news of her father’s release. “I’m so very grateful, thank you so much,” said Anna, who spoke during the virtual press conference but did not appear on camera. Since DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a press statement describing Morales Reyes as an “illegal alien who threatened to assassinate President Trump,” his family has received online harassment and death threats. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I’ve always been my dad’s little girl who grew up with a hardworking dad that always was making sure his family has food on the table, having a roof over our heads,” said Anna Morales. “He loved to take us to the park every weekend and go for walks as a family.” She recalled cookouts with her dad, who worked as a dishwasher in Milwaukee for the last nine years. Morales lamented that her father is now facing the threat of deportation based on false accusations.  “He is not a criminal. He is a hardworking man, a provider, and most importantly a father who holds family together,” she said.  “Without my dad, me and my siblings wouldn’t be where we are today — his sacrifice and his drive to give us a better life.”  
“If he were taken from us, it wouldn’t just be a financial loss, it would be an emotional one that we honestly don’t know how to recover from,” she added. “My siblings and I rely on him not just for the roof over our heads or food on the table, but for his presence, his advice, and the way he keeps our family united.” 
“My dad is not a threat to anyone. He is a good man who got caught up in a terrible situation.” 
Despite the decision to release Morales Reyes, after the real author of the letter threatening Trump confessed that he had tried to frame Morales Reyes to prevent him from testifying against him in a criminal trial, the Department of Homeland Security has not removed a press release from its website accusing Morales Reyes of being the author of the letter.

In a statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded to Morales Reyes’ release on bond, saying,  “while this criminal illegal alien is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, he is in the country illegally with previous arrests for felony hit and run, criminal damage to property, and disorderly conduct with domestic abuse. The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and fulfilling the President’s mandate to deport illegal aliens. DHS will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country.” In 1996, Morales Reyes was arrested for a hit and run and property damage, but was not charged. In another 1996 incident he was ticketed for disorderly conduct and criminal damage after a dispute with his wife in which no one was injured, NPR reported. 
“It’s a disgrace that we have a government that is promoting false information of a very serious nature against a man who is a victim of a crime, and has been falsely accused,” Neumann-Ortiz told Wisconsin Examiner.
Morales Reyes’ family does not feel safe, Neumann-Ortiz said. “This just shows that this administration is not interested in safety. They’re interested in this propaganda campaign to demonize immigrants, and to do with them whatever they will, to accuse them of anything and put them in jail and throw away the key.”

Just before the bond hearing, attorney Cane Oulahan, who represented Morales Reyes during immigration proceedings, said that he was hoping for a “just result, which would be for Ramón to get out on a fair bond and rejoin his family, so they can start to heal from all the trauma they’ve been through.” Oulahan thanked Anna Morales for her bravery in coming forward with a statement Tuesday morning. The attorney said that factors which the judge would consider, including danger to the community and flight risk, were low for Morales Reyes. “I think it’s clear that Ramón is not a dangerous person at all,” said Oulahan. “It’s been over 30 years since he’s had any minor incidents, he’s a responsible husband and father, hard worker, someone who contributes to our community.” 
Oulahan said that Morales Reyes had no reason to be considered a flight risk. “He’s got every interest in staying here,” said Oulahan. “I mean, he’s been here almost 40 years. He has family here, this is his home, and he’s actively cooperating in a U-Visa investigation still, and so he has every reason to show up for his hearings.” A U-Visa is a form of immigration relief intended to encourage crime victims to cooperate with law enforcement investigations and court proceedings, while also providing a path to permanent residency. 
Neumann-Ortiz said in a statement that the bond decision was “a meaningful victory not only for Ramón and his family but for our entire community.” The decision she added, “reflects the courage and strength of community organizing, solidarity, and collective action. We thank all who stood with Ramón, and we urge continued support as the process ahead remains long and challenging. We also continue to demand that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) fully clear Ramón’s name and correct the false allegations against him.”
Morales Reyes was the victim of an attempted armed robbery in September 2023. The man accused of the attempted robbery, Demetric Scott, told investigators that he penned a letter claiming to be Morales Reyes and threatening to use a large caliber rifle to assassinate Trump. Scott believed that the letter would result in Morales Reyes’ deportation, and prevent him from testifying against Scott in court.

Morales Reyes was born in a rural part of Mexico where he received very little formal education. He cannot speak English, and cannot read or write proficiently. The letter penned by Scott and later elevated by Noem’s press release was neatly written in fluent English. CNN reported that after he was arrested by immigration agents, Morales Reyes was questioned by detectives from the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD), who had already suspected that someone was setting him up to be deported. 
Scott claimed that he carried out the plan to get Morales Reyes deported on his own, without any assistance. He has now  been charged with identity theft and felony witness intimidation. Because Scott admitted to forging the letter, Oulahan said that he didn’t expect the letter to be relevant to the judge during Morales Reyes’ bond hearing. 
A staff member for U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) read a letter from Moore during the virtual press conference. Morales Reyes lives in  Moore’s district  and Moore  visited him in the Dodge County Jail. Moore has issued a letter requesting DHS to retract the accusations against Morales Reyes and remove Noem’s statement claiming that he threatened to assassinate Trump from the DHS website.

Laura Kelly to fill a vacancy on Kansas Supreme Court. Fifteen lawyers applied.,"A nonpartisan nominating committee recommended Gov. Laura Kelly choose from among three nominees to fill a vacancy on the Kansas Supreme Court. Justice Evelyn Wilson is retiring July 4. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A state judicial nominating commission unanimously recommended Tuesday that Gov. Laura Kelly choose from among two eastern Kansas district court judges and a soft-spoken attorney in private practice to fill an impending vacancy on the Kansas Supreme Court.
The nonpartisan commission completed two days of interviews with 15 applicants before several rounds of voting narrowed the list to Douglas County District Court Judge Amy Hanley, Johnson County District Court Judge Christopher Jayaram and Leawood attorney Larkin Walsh. It would be the Democratic governor’s fourth appointment to state’s seven-justice Supreme Court.
Justice Evelyn Wilson, who was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative condition known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, plans to retire July 4. She was appointed by Kelly in 2019, but took the oath in 2020.
“We had very good candidates, and that’s important,” said Gloria Flentje, chairperson of the merit-selection commission. “I hope that every time in the future it will be a hard decision because there are good candidates who want to be on the Kansas Supreme Court.”
Hanley, who was appointed to the district court in 2016 by Republican Gov. Sam Brownback, was among top vote-getters in each of the rounds conducted by the commission. Before joining the bench, she argued 20 times before the state Supreme Court or Kansas Court of Appeals. She was a special assistant U.S. attorney in Kansas and an assistant attorney general for Kansas. She earned a law degree at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.
“I believe litigation experience is crucial to this position,” said Hanley, of Lawrence. “I believe strongly in precedent.”
She said one of the biggest challenges before the state Supreme Court was to respond to the tarnished public image of courts and judges in general.
“Public perception is something I believe is best addressed through education,” she said.
Walsh, senior counsel at Stueve Siegel Hanson and a 2004 graduate of the University of Kansas law school, clerked for U.S. District Court Judge Carlos Murguia and was a research attorney for state Supreme Court Justice Carol Beier. Walsh’s legal practice centered on civil cases in state and federal courts. More recently, she worked on plaintiffs’ rights in labor and employment cases.
Retired Kansas Court of Appeals Judge Steve Leben described Walsh in a reference letter as someone with “intellectual humility.”
“I found that to be so moving,” Walsh said. “It really brings a tear to my eye that someone would describe me that way. I am not a self-promoter. This is not my scene, but I do think a critical attribute of being a judge is to maintain that sense that you don’t have all the answers.”
The Leawood resident said the obligation of a state justice would be to maintain fidelity to the law, conduct careful reviews of facts and examine issues in the way parties framed them.
“Ego doesn’t play a huge role in that,” said Walsh, who suggested the same skill was important in forming consensus among justices. “Being the loudest or being the most inflexible or being the most aggressive is never the most effective.”
Jayaram, who was appointed a district court judge in Johnson County by Kelly in 2021, said his 20-year legal career before that point focused on business litigation and health care matters. He was an attorney at Horn Aylward & Bandy and earned a law degree at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon.
He said the text of the Kansas Constitution ought to be reviewed from a pragmatic standpoint without losing connection to actual words contained in the document.
“I don’t think that you should overlook original words that are there,” said Jayaram, of Lenexa.
He was questioned by the commission about how judges or justices ought to handle personal political views when deciding cases.
“My job as a district court judge is really to not pay attention to what’s popular and not popular,” Jayaram said. “I’m not a political animal.”
The issue holds relevance given some district court judges in Kansas — not Johnson County — were elected by popular vote rather than appointed by a governor. In addition, the August 2026 ballot in Kansas will include a proposed amendment to the constitution requiring election of Supreme Court justices.
On the commission’s fifth ballot, Jayaram edged out on a vote of 5-4 Robert Wonnell, who also served as a judge in the Johnson County District Court. The commission conducted the one-on-one runoff to determine the third finalist after Jayaram and Wonnell tied on the fourth ballot.

The council points to a growing need to understand other potential risk factors driving Iowa’s cancer rates. The latest Cancer in Iowa report from the Iowa Cancer Registry shows Iowa has the second highest, age-adjusted rate of cancers in the country, and is one of only two states with rising rates of new cancers. 
The series of listening sessions kicks off with an event in Indianola Wednesday at 5:30 p.m., followed by sessions in Des Moines, Burlington, Davenport and Solon which are free to attend, though online registration is requested. 
The sessions will have a presentation with county-specific health data and then allow attendees space to share how cancer has impacted their lives. 
IEC has also announced dates and locations for listening sessions in July and August in : Albia, Elkader, Decorah, Council Bluffs, Red Oak, Emmetsburg, Sioux City, Carroll, Waterloo, Tama and a virtual session. These sessions are not yet open for registration. 
Iowans who can’t make it to one of the sessions can also share their stories virtually through a form on IEC’s website. 
The Cancer and Environmental Risk Factors in Iowa initiative will result in a report and statewide campaign, with a goal of bringing Iowans “together around policies that will reduce environmental contamination as a factor in cancers in Iowa.”
Registration and more information can be found at the Iowa Environmental Council website.

Abrego Garcia was returned to Nashville from El Salvador on Friday to face two criminal human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
He appeared briefly in a downtown Nashville courtroom late Friday, and is scheduled to return to court this Friday for a formal arraignment of the charges against him.
That hearing will also consider a motion by the Justice Department to keep Abrego Garcia in custody until the date of his trial, which has not yet been set.
A federal grand jury indictment issued under seal May 21 and made public June 6 charges Abrego Garcia with “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Wrongly deported Maryland man Abrego Garcia returned to U.S.

Abrego Garcia “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens” for profit between 2016 and 2025 as a member of the MS-13 gang, prosecutors said.
Dumaka Shabazz, a federal public defender appointed to represent Garcia in the criminal case, declined comment on the charges Monday.
“At this date, we are not inclined to give a statement,” Shabazz said via email.
The criminal charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, court records show.
Abrego Garcia was driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men when he was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville, court records said. He was not charged in the incident.
Prosecutors now allege that further investigation revealed the stop involved Abrego Garcia smuggling migrants within the United States illegally.
Abrego Garcia faces a potentially lengthy sentence: a maximum of 10 years in prison for each person he allegedly transported.
‘A stain on the Constitution’: Abrego Garcia lawyers refuse to drop his case against U.S.

A resident of Maryland until a prior traffic stop on March 12 this year, Abrego Garcia was dispatched within days to an El Salvador prison along with scores of other detainees.
An immigrant from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia had received an immigration court order in 2019 that allowed him to reside in the United States and specifically barred the federal government from deporting him to El Salvador, where, he said, he feared gang violence.
The prosecutors’ memo seeking Abrego Garcia’s detention until trial, filed in federal court Monday, alleges there is a “serious risk” that Abrego Garcia “and/or persons acting on his behalf will obstruct justice and/or intimidate the witnesses against him” should he be released from federal custody pending his trial.
They also argued Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and a danger to the community.
In their memo, prosecutors said they plan to raise allegations that children without legal immigration status were transported and “used in unsafe ways” to avoid detection of Abrego Garcia’s illegal smuggling activities.
Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes involving the illegal transport of children.
Prosecutors also acknowledged that, should Abrego Garcia be released pending trial, he would likely be immediately taken into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to face further proceedings in immigration court.
Nevertheless, they argued that should he not be taken into ICE custody, Abrego Garcia would have an “enormous reason to flee.”
U.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes, who presided over Friday’s brief hearing, has given Abrego’s attorneys until Wednesday to file a legal response.

(Danielle Prokop)In the one year since the federal Radiation Exposure Compensation Act expired, New Mexico survivors of federal nuclear testing programs said they have continued to watch family members and friends die.
The RECA legislation, passed in 1990, compensated people who developed cancers or other illnesses as a result of radiation exposure from the United States’ atomic programs. New Mexico’s Trinity test downwinders and uranium miners who worked in the industry after RECA’s coverage period (post-1971) have been notably excluded. New Mexico’s congressional delegation have made numerous attempts to expand and extend the bill, with the U.S. Senate passing the bill to do so twice last year. But the bill never made it to the U.S. House floor for a vote, and expired on June 10, 2024.
Time’s run out for the Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act

Tina Cordova, co-founder of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium, which includes victims and descendants downwind from the 1945 Trinity Test, told attendees during a Tuesday news conference marking the RECA-expiration anniversary, two of her cousins have died in the last year, one “after battling brain cancer for many, many years.” Her youngest brother, Cordova noted, also had also been diagnosed with kidney cancer and is fighting the disease alongside his daughter, who also has cancer.
“My family has five generations of cancer now,” said Cordova, herself a cancer survivor, whose battle for justice serves as the centerpiece for Lois Lipman’s award-winning documentary First We Bombed New Mexico. “My family is not unique. We’ve documented thousands of families like mine exhibiting four and five generations of cancer. That’s the face of the legacy that we’ve been left to deal with.”
Loretta Anderson (Pueblo of Laguna), a patient advocate and co- founder of the Southwest Uranium Miners Coalition Post-71, said she works with 1,000 uranium miners and their families and, in the year since RECA expired, counts 10 who have died.
“They died with no compensation, no apology from the government, and many of them were part of our coalition,” Anderson said. “We mourn, we hurt, we cry, we suffer. Many of our people are sick. Our young are now being diagnosed with cancer and other horrific diseases. We’re losing our young. We’re losing our future.”










We're losing our young. We're losing our future.


– Loretta Anderson, Pueblo of Laguna and Southwest Uranium Miners Coalition Post-71 


Congress “is responsible for those deaths,” Democratic U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, said during the call, in which she exhorted her Republican colleagues in the U.S. House “to stand up for their constituents. “Congress has failed its moral obligation…Speaker [Mike] Johnson needs to let us vote.”
Nuclear survivors have lobbied for decades for inclusion in RECA. The current push comes amid the Trump administration’s push for renewed uranium mining in New Mexico and elsewhere, which both Cordova and Anderson oppose.
“Our government has not cleaned up the mess they made in the beginning,” Cordova said. “They have not done anything to address the first round of uranium mining. And as it relates to downwinders, this is the 80th anniversary since Trinity. We have no faith in the government coming back to take care of the mess they made, and they want us to support new mining? Personally, we cannot do that.”

Anderson noted that she lives 11 miles from the former Jackpile-Paguate uranium mine, now a Superfund site.
“And so, we’re going to fight,” any new mines, she said. “We need to compensate, take care of the lands that they destroyed…before any mining is done, because people are sick, people are suffering… I know many of our people here on the reservations and surrounding communities do not support uranium mining here ever again.”
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) noted that the Trump administration’s push for more uranium mining should serve as yet another reason to support RECA.
“The fundamental issue here is like,’ let’s own up to what we did as a as a government,’” Heinrich said. “That’s just the right and moral thing to do…you can’t expect communities to embrace new mining if you haven’t fixed the problems that you created 50, 60 years ago.”
As for reintroducing RECA and pushing it through Congress, Leger Fernández said she has spoken directly with Johnson, whose concerns, she said, had more to do with the cost than the concept of compensation.
Cordova noted that if survivors could sue the federal government in civil court, they’d likely receive millions in dollars in settlements — far more than is expected in the event that RECA passes. That being said, “there is no amount of money that anyone could ever pay me for the pain and suffering that my family has seen…and there is absolutely no way that the government could ever make my family whole again,” she said.
U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), who has sponsored RECA legislation every year since he entered Congress in 2008, and most recently co-sponsored the RECA expansion bill with GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. Luján noted the irony of Republicans worrying about the cost of RECA, given that Republicans in the U.S. House are  “about to pass a bill for a third time that’s going to add over $2 trillion to the debt.”
Nonetheless, Luján noted, ultimately RECA is a “bipartisan issue and it has a bipartisan solution — I would argue bipartisan solutions. Alongside our congressional delegation, I commit to continue to work with our bipartisan coalition to keep RECA moving forward.” And to the victims “still living and suffering…I’ll never stop fighting for your stories to be heard and for justice to be delivered.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Trinity_Tina-Cordova_Prokop-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A confidential informant’s first-hand observations met the requirements needed for Alamogordo police to search a person’s home for evidence of selling drugs, the state’s highest court ruled last week.
In a split decision, all but one of the New Mexico Supreme Court’s justices on June 5 affirmed the state Court of Appeals’ reversal of a district court ruling that excluded drugs seized during the search.
The ruling stemmed from a 2019 search conducted by the Alamogordo Police Department of resident Michelle Perea’s home, based on information from the informant.
The informant told police that in the preceding three days while inside Perea’s home, they had seen her handle large amounts of methamphetamine, and that she kept “a continuous supply of illicit narcotics” there and on her person.
Based on that information, provided in an affidavit, Magistrate Judge Steve Guthrie issued a search warrant for evidence of drug trafficking. When police searched the home, they found half a gram of what they suspected to be meth, along with paraphernalia. They arrested Perea and, while at the Otero County jail, found another 1.4 grams of what they suspected to be meth in her underwear.
Prosecutors then charged Perea with possession of meth and paraphernalia, but District Court Judge Angie Schneider granted her motion to suppress the evidence because the warrant lacked sufficient detail to support Guthrie’s probable cause finding.
Specifically, Schneider found the affidavit deficient because it did not provide any evidence Perea was selling drugs; failed to state how much meth the informant saw; how they knew that it was enough to be “consistent with trafficking;” how it was packaged; or how the informant observed her.
Perea’s trial for possessing meth has been on hold since state prosecutors appealed Schneider’s order suppressing the evidence to the Court of Appeals, saying in a notice to the court that the evidence is important to the prosecution.
The appeals court in March 2022 ruled that Guthrie had enough information from the police officer’s sworn statement to sign off on the warrant. The Supreme Court’s recent decision upholds the appeals court’s ruling.
While the justices refrained from creating hard-and-fast rules when it comes to probable cause, they wrote that the informant’s first-hand observations were enough to support the magistrate judge’s approval of the warrant in this case.
“In combination with the CI’s credibility, the affidavit identified that the CI personally observed an illegal substance, in quantities sufficient to indicate illegal activity, and therefore provided sufficient factual detail from which the magistrate court could reasonably infer ‘probable cause to believe that a search [would] uncover evidence of wrongdoing,’” the majority wrote.
Justice Michael Vigil dissented from the majority, writing that the affidavit was unconstitutional because it wasn’t specific enough to support a claim that Perea was trafficking meth, and instead only supporting the claim that she possessed it.
“To establish probable cause that methamphetamine is in a home does not by itself establish probable cause that trafficking is being conducted from that home,” Vigil wrote.
However, the majority wrote, since the affidavit claimed that Perea was trafficking meth, it necessarily claimed she possessed it.

Similar to a signing day for athletes, students planning to enroll as education majors at the university signed “letters of intent” to become the next generation of educators. 
Students traveled to Edmond from their hometowns across the state, excited to celebrate their futures in education and hoping to snag some of the $100,000 in scholarship money at the event. They were met with UCO merchandise, snacks and desserts, and time to meet with current students and faculty at the college of education.

With teacher shortages at the center of state leaders’ conversations, UCO is one of Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities looking for unique approaches to incentivize students to become the next generation of educators. 
The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education have identified teaching as a “critical occupation” and have pledged to produce more graduates in the field. 
Across the Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, which includes 25 public colleges and universities, nearly 3,100 education degrees were awarded during the 2023-24 school year, up from a low of almost 2,700 in the 2018-19 school year. 
Almost 92% of graduates with a bachelor’s degree in teaching are working in Oklahoma classrooms after one year, according to data from the state regents. After five years, about 80% are still working in Oklahoma.
Proponents say this growth is proof that the campus-by-campus initiatives they’ve launched in recent years are working. 
Making the degree accessible
Universities are frequently turning to financial incentives to tackle the shortages. 
Inspired to Teach is a statewide incentive program offering qualified Oklahoma college students the opportunity to earn over $25,000 as they complete their education and teach in Oklahoma post-graduation. 
Of the 38 participating public and private higher education institutions, UCO, the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University have the highest enrollment in the program, said Angela Caddell, a spokesperson for the state regents. Since the program’s launch, $13.5 million has been disbursed, and 6,500 participants are currently enrolled, she said. 
Caddell said the state regents anticipated growth will continue and that since the program’s inception, freshman enrollment in teacher education programs has increased 30%.

At OU, a lot of the work to address the teacher shortage comes from recruitment and scholarships, said Stacy Reeder, dean of the college of education. 
“I’m an Oklahoman and a lifetime Oklahoma educator,” she said. “And I always tell our students, there’s more money than ever to be a teacher. It’s a great time to decide to be a teacher because we’ve got so much funding for you and you have a guaranteed job.”
The OU Debt Free Teachers Program offers $20,000 scholarships to 25 to 30 students each year who are accepted into the program. Students are given $5,000 each year to put toward their education and they can “teach it off.” Students must teach in Oklahoma for at least four years after graduation or the money reverts to a loan and must be repaid. 
In the decade the donor-funded program has been operating, Reeder said there has been a 94% retention rate of students, and program graduates have been placed “all over” the state. 
At UCO’s teacher signing event, the school distributed over $100,000 in recruitment and retention scholarships among the 62 students in attendance.
The scholarships are funded through “special workforce development funds” allocated by the state regents, said Kim Pennington, assistant dean for the university’s college of education. 
Jennifer Burris, project manager for teacher recruitment and retention at UCO, said the school started the program to help tackle the teacher shortage.
UCO had already admitted 400 new educators as of March, a 37% increase from this time last year. 
The state Legislature also made efforts to end the teacher shortage and encourage current and future teachers to stay and work in Oklahoma, including extending the teacher salary schedule and extending existing college scholarships to the children of long-time Oklahoma teachers.

Stephanie Hathcock, a professor at OSU and interim head of OSU’s school of teaching, learning and educational sciences, said other university initiatives to recruit and retain teachers center around making education accessible and flexible.
OSU offers education degrees for elementary education fully online, giving students the ability to earn a degree from home. She said last budget year, around a third of OSU’s elementary education degrees were completed online. 
“I think a lot of what we’ve been doing is responding to what’s happening within the state, trying to respond,” Hathcock said. “And we would love to get to a place where we can maintain and continue to just really do our jobs well, rather than having to continually kind of morph and respond, morph and respond.” 
Providing support post graduation
In an attempt to support educators in their first few years of teaching, OSU launched OK Thrive with financial support from legislative appropriations, donors and OSU. John Weaver, director of the program, said it’s intended to give new teachers a community to lean on through group meetings and individual coaching. 
“We also know that the first few years of teaching are incredibly challenging,” Weaver said. “Across the nation, and in Oklahoma, show that you know, upwards of 40%, 50%, even some estimates show 60% of teachers leave within three to five years of being in the profession.” 
The program has a 95% retention rate for its first two cohorts, with data not yet available for its current cohort, he said. The program operates in 50 schools across 25 school districts, Weaver said. 
Teach to Transform is another OU program intended to offer community and support to future teachers. The program aims to “address the critical need for teachers from underserved populations” and places interested students in cohorts. 
OU had a 22% increase in incoming freshmen at the college of education, but it will be a few years until it’s known if they are all retained, Reeder said. 
“I think there’s a tremendous need to elevate the teaching profession, and that can happen in a variety of ways,” Reeder said. “Just general support for and trust in teachers is something we really are lacking. And I think that’s played a big role in the teacher shortage as well.”

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/NJ Monitor)Attorneys general in 16 jurisdictions sued Monday to block a Trump administration plan to redistribute thousands of devices that convert guns to machine guns, including distribution in states where such devices are banned by state law.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland, said the plan would not only expose residents of those states to greater amounts of deadly violence, but it would be contrary to federal law that calls for the seizure of machine-gun conversion devices. And it would cause federal officials to “aid and abet violations of state law” by distributing the devices in states where they are outlawed, the suit said.
The decision to return almost 12,000 forced reset triggers — which allow shooters to fire hundreds of rounds a minute with one pull of the trigger — was announced in a settlement last month between the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and gun manufacturers and gun-rights groups.
“These devices enable firearms to fire up to 900 bullets per minute. The increased rate of fire allows carnage and chaos to reign on the streets,” said Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown in a virtual press briefing Monday with fellow Democrats, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings.
“Everyone nearby becomes vulnerable to serious injury or death. These are battlefield weapons that have no place in our communities,” Brown said.
Under the Biden administration, ATF classified forced reset triggers as “prohibited machine guns under federal law … and conducted extensive retrieval operations, seizing nearly 12,000 FRTs from the field,” according to the lawsuit.
But the new administration reversed course after a Feb. 7 executive order from President Donald Trump on “Protecting Second Amendment Rights.”
On May 16, the Justice Department announced a settlement with Rare Breed Triggers, a manufacturer of the devices based in Wichita City, Texas. Under the deal, the company agreed not to develop or design such triggers for handguns, to promote safe and responsible use of its products, and to enforce its patents to “prevent infringement that could threaten public safety.”
In exchange, the government agreed not to enforce any policy where an FRT is “contended to be” a machine gun, and to return by Sept. 30 any reset triggers seized or “taken as a result of a voluntary surrender.”
“We won,” Lawrence DeMonico, president of Rare Breed Triggers, said in a video posted online the day settlement was announced. “With the Trump administration’s renewed focused on justice and their commitment to correcting the weaponization of the DOJ under the Biden administration, we were finally able to secure a deal that brought this fight to a close.”
Representatives with Rare Breed Triggers and the Justice Department did not respond to email requests for comment Monday.
The National Association of Gun Rights, which was also a party to the settlement, said it a statement that the deal will survive any challenge from the “anti-gun attorneys general.”
“A federal court already ruled the government unlawfully seized thousands of legal triggers from law-abiding Americans — a decision that the ATF now acknowledges and accepts,” said Hannah Hill, vice president for the association. “These states lack standing to file this lawsuit, and they know it. This suit is just reckless political lawfare.”
But the states’ lawsuit highlights the impact of gun violence in their jurisdictions, where it said there were nearly 47,000 gun-related deaths in 2023. Illinois had the most such deaths that year, at 1,691. Of the states represented at Mondays briefing, Maryland recorded 737 gun-related deaths in 2023, New Jersey had 430 and Delaware had 124, according to the suit.
The suit also spells out the financial burden that comes with gun violence, for medical bills, police, court and prison costs. It said one fatal shooting in Baltimore can cost $2.4 million and a nonfatal shooting costs $1.5 million. In Newark, New Jersey, the cost is nearly $2.2 million for a fatal shooting and $1 million for a nonfatal shooting.
“This is not a partisan issue. It is a public safety issue,” Delaware’s Jennings said. “The Trump administration’s deal to redistribute these deadly devices violates the law, full stop. It undermines public safety and ties the hand of law enforcement.”
Platkin recalled the shooting death in March 2022, just two months after he took office, of SeQuoya Bacon-Jones, who was a bystander to a shooting when she was struck and killed. Platkin said SeQuoya would have celebrated her 13th birthday last Saturday.
“She had dreamed of becoming a law enforcement officer, but instead she was killed by a single stray bullet while she was playing hide-and-seek in the courtyard of her apartment complex,” Platkin said. “I wish the Trump administration … would put little kids like Sequoya’s interests ahead of the gun lobby’s. But since they don’t seem to care, we’re going to make them care.”
Besides Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, other jurisdictions on the suit are the District of Columbia and the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. All but Maine and Vermont currently have state laws prohibiting forced reset triggers or guns modified with them.

(Getty Images)An early review of Indiana’s 2024 infant death records showed a year-over-year decline — potentially reaching a historic low, according to provisional data from the state health department.
Indiana’s Department of Health (IDOH) reported an infant mortality rate of 6.3 deaths per 1,000 live births, down from 6.6 deaths in 2023. If the rate holds after final review, it would be Indiana’s lowest since the state began tracking the measure in 1900. The previous low was 6.5 deaths in 2019, according to IDOH data.
”With Indiana’s infant mortality rate at its lowest in over a century, we see the real impact of everyone who is focused on protecting our most vulnerable Hoosiers,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a Tuesday statement. “We are committed to ensuring that even more babies have a healthy start and a strong future.”

Infant mortality refers to the death of a child before their first birthday and is often seen as a key indicator of overall public health. Indiana has long struggled to lower its rate, particularly among marginalized populations and in rural areas. For years, the state ranked among the worst in the nation.
“We are ecstatic that more Hoosier babies are celebrating their first birthdays,” said State Health Commissioner Dr. Lindsay Weaver. “Seeing these efforts pay off is something to celebrate, and we are grateful to clinicians, healthcare centers and affiliates, local health departments and all our other partners for their collective efforts.”
Indiana’s rate still remains above the national average, however. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national infant mortality rate was 5.6 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2023. The federal “Healthy People 2030 goal” is to lower the national rate to 5 deaths per 1,000 births.
IDOH officials pointed to ongoing efforts through Health First Indiana. The initiative supports partnerships between the state health department and local groups to improve prenatal care access, support home visiting services, promote breastfeeding, and expand education on infant safe sleep practices. IDOH also reviews hospital discharge and fatality data to guide future interventions.
Health First Indiana funding was slashed in the new state budget, however.
A final analysis of the 2024 numbers is expected later this year.
“The critical work to further reduce infant mortality continues,” Weaver said. “The Indiana Department of Health is committed to our role to decrease the number of infant deaths in Indiana and give the next generation of Hoosiers the best possible start.”

She said the attacker in New Orleans used artificial intelligence through Meta smart glasses to scope out the location before the attack that killed 14 people and injured dozens.“The threats we observed in the New Orleans attack remain a very real concern that needs significant planning and resourcing given the spread of crowds before, during, and after these events,” she said.Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, the top Democrat on the panel, said hosting international sporting events is “an incredible opportunity to show the best of America to visitors.”Los Angeles and the OlympicsTwo GOP senators, Ashley Moody of Florida and Bernie Moreno of Ohio, questioned how LA would be capable of handling the Olympics in 2028, given the ongoing protests sparked after federal immigration officials raided several Home Depots across Los Angeles looking for people in the country without legal authorization.In response, Trump has deployed 4,000 National Guard troops – without California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s authority – and 700 Marines to LA.One of the witnesses, CEO of the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games Reynold Hoover, said local and state officials in California were capable of handling the Olympics and working with the federal government for security measures.“There’s no place in the world like LA to host the world’s largest Olympics ever,” Hoover said. “I am confident, come July 14 of 2028, when we do the opening ceremony in the Coliseum and the stadium in Inglewood, the world will be watching and see America at its best.”Hoover said that hosting the Olympics will be the equivalent of holding seven Superbowls for 30 days straight with more than 11,000 Olympic athletes and more than 4,400 paralympic athletes. Drones and the OlympicsDemocratic Sens. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Fetterman raised concerns about drones getting too close to sporting events.Hassan said while the federal government has taken steps to address private drones, she asked Hoover how he was preparing to address any drone issues for the 2028 Olympics.Hoover said that “tools to include counter (unmanned aircraft systems) drone technology remain key priorities for our ongoing collaboration with our federal, state and local partners.” He added that coordinating with the Secret Service has been helpful in dealing with unmanned drones.Ligon said she has seen drones being used near global sporting events.“Malign actors can now more easily acquire, build, or customize drones at lower costs, with extended ranges, higher speeds, and greater payload capacities,” she said.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — New performance goals for Oklahoma City Public Schools aim to have 40% of fourth graders reading on grade level and 20% of eighth graders proficient in math by August 2030.
The district’s school board approved new goals Monday after several months of planning and community surveys. Board members say the metrics will encourage more discussion on students and their academics.
“We only exist to educate kids, and we never really talked about it,” board Chairperson Paula Lewis said after the vote. “So for me, these goals are really showing the public that we know why we exist.”
A third goal aims to have 69% of 11th and 12th graders participating in a post-secondary option, like college credits or vocational education, by August 2030. 
In 2024, 37% of the district’s high school juniors and seniors participated in such an option, which is measured as “post-secondary opportunities” on annual state report cards.

The Oklahoma City district intends to jump from 25% of fourth graders scoring proficiently on annual state reading tests in 2024 to 40% doing so in 2030. Eighth grade math rates would have to increase from 11% making a proficient score in 2024 to 20% in 2030 to meet the new goal.
A proficient score on state tests is meant to indicate a student is performing at grade level, though the statewide definition of proficiency has gone up and down over the past year. Those changes have caused a delay in the release of 2025 test scores.
Board member Jessica Cifuentes said some constituents complained Oklahoma City’s reading and math goals aren’t ambitious enough.
“It seems like not a lot, but it is a lot given we have a really big ship to steer,” Cifuentes said during the meeting.
The large size of the district — 33,000 students across 57 schools — tempered the goals, Lewis said. Some schools will have to exceed the goals to drive up the districtwide average.
“But you’re still going to have some (schools) that probably aren’t quite there,” Lewis said. “And so when you’re looking at the district, the size of our district, it doesn’t mean we’re just shooting for 40% (in fourth grade reading proficiency). It means we’re shooting for the best that every single school leader and school can get to.”
In recent years, Oklahoma City improved its reading results on state tests by a rate of 1% per year, said Laura McGee, senior executive director of elementary education and leadership. 
That rate will have to accelerate to 3% improvement each year to meet the 2030 reading goal, she said.
Changes to Oklahoma state testing adds complication 
However, changes to test scoring at the state level adds uncertainty to the metrics the district is using to set its reading and math targets. 
Last year, the state lowered the bar for students to make a proficient score on annual reading and math tests, sending proficiency rates spiking across Oklahoma. That change was apparent in Oklahoma City’s test results, where the number of students scoring proficiently in reading jumped from 10.8% in 2023 to 25% in 2024.
The Commission for Educational Quality and Accountability voted last month to reverse the changes, restoring stricter scoring methods that Oklahoma used from 2017 to 2023. Proficiency rates could decrease as a result.
The stricter scoring will apply to 2025 state test results. Scores from 2024, the foundational year for Oklahoma City’s long-term goals, are now a statistical outlier.

District leaders say that won’t be an issue. The school board set multiple interim goals based on a different data set that represent steps along the way toward the primary objectives of improving fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math.
These interim goals are based on NWEA MAP Growth tests taken by millions of students nationwide. Students take MAP tests multiple times each school year while Oklahoma state tests are administered once a year in the spring. 
The MAP Growth tests gauge students’ reading and math levels, but they aren’t affected by scoring changes on state-level exams.
As the district aims to improve fourth-grade reading levels, its first interim goal would have kindergarteners’ median reading performance increase from the 34th percentile in 2024 to the 50th percentile in 2028 on MAP Growth tests. 
In other words, the median score for Oklahoma City kindergarteners would meet MAP’s nationwide average for kindergarten reading by 2028.
Another interim benchmark aims to have 23% of seventh graders performing above average — in the the 60th percentile — on MAP math tests by fall 2028, up from 17% in fall 2024.
MAP tests are highly correlative with Oklahoma state tests, said Jason Galloway, chief of staff to the district superintendent. District staff can calculate an equivalent state test score based on a student’s MAP performance, Galloway said.
That will allow the district to continue measuring student growth even while state officials change their scoring methods, he said.
But, state tests are “just one point in the data decision,” Oklahoma City Superintendent Jamie Polk said. Growing individual students’ scores is at the core of the district’s strategy.
Involving students in tracking their test results and setting learning goals has been a priority in Oklahoma City schools in recent years.
“What moves us is individual students and then the (school) site in which we hold the principals accountable,” Polk said. “But what they do with the (state test scoring), up and down, will not necessarily have anything to do with our day-to-day operation.”

(Photo by Bhaamati Borkhetaria/CommonWealth Beacon)BOSTON — The Massachusetts House of Representatives passed cannabis bill last week that would permit intoxicating hemp-derived beverages to be sold in licensed Massachusetts liquor stores while ordering edible intoxicating hemp-derived products like gummies off store shelves, but critics say the legislation fails to address the core problem of enforcement at the local level.
Intoxicating hemp-derived edible products have the same active ingredient as cannabis, but are not subject to any oversight by the state Cannabis Control Commission. Sales of hemp products have proliferated across the state because of a federal loophole that defines hemp differently than cannabis.
State agencies issued guidance last spring that declared the hemp products illegal in the state, but enforcement of the ban has remained uneven, with local boards of health complaining they do not have the resources to police hemp products and take them off the shelves in their communities.
The House bill explicitly makes hemp-derived edible products illegal in the state, while allowing hemp-derived beverages to be sold in licensed liquor stores under the supervision of the state cannabis commission.
The law directs local boards of health to monitor the sale of any edible hemp products, including taking samples from stores for testing, removing any illegal products, and providing written warnings of added steps that will be taken for a subsequent offense.
Cheryl Sbarra, the head of the Massachusetts Association of Health Boards, said that local health boards don’t have the resources to carry out enforcement without added funding. “Your law is only as good as your ability to enforce it, and if you don’t have the ability to enforce it because you don’t have any money, then the law is meaningless,” she said.
Money from taxes on hemp-derived beverages or fines the state could levy on stores illegally selling hemp-derived edibles would go to the state’s general fund.
Sbarra said enforcement isn’t as simple as walking in and grabbing the products off store shelves. The local health boards would need to do extra inspections of stores. There would have to be a protocol for storing and testing potentially illicit products. And many local boards of health don’t have established relationships with labs that could test hemp products.
“I don’t think this will be enforced very evenly on the local level because it will depend on who has the capacity on top of their already extremely busy jobs,” said Phoebe Walker, the director of community health at the Franklin Regional Council of Governments, an umbrella organization that serves communities in Franklin County. “What would happen is uneven enforcement, which is not good for public health.”
Sbarra and Walker pointed out that there was language in other House bills that would have directed funding from tax revenue on legal hemp products to local boards of health, but that provision didn’t make it into the legislation that was approved last week.
The cannabis industry has been pushing stricter enforcement on hemp products because they compete with cannabis. Cannabis business owners say hemp products are undercutting their sales with lower priced, unregulated products.
Ryan Dominguez, the head of the Massachusetts Cannabis Coalition, an advocacy group for the cannabis industry, said the coalition supports including a funding stream in the legislation for local health boards to enforce the ban on sale of hemp-derived edibles.
“Enforcement is important for the cannabis industry because we have seen that the all-out ban on the intoxicating hemp products, which has been in existence in Massachusetts even prior to this bill, has not been enforced,” said Dominguez. “We really want to focus on removing these products from the shelves of gas stations and liquor stores, and the way to do that is to give the local boards of health the money to do so.”
Under the legislation approved by the House, the cannabis commission would oversee testing, labeling, and other regulations for hemp beverages, which could only be sold at licensed liquor stores.
The cannabis bill would also restructure the Cannabis Control Commission, raise the cap on the number of retail licenses a single company can own from three to six, increase purchasing and possession limits for cannabis, and loosen existing requirements for medical marijuana businesses.
Travis Ahern, the cannabis commission’s executive director, welcomed the move to clamp down on hemp products. But he said the commission – which has previously called for more funding to carry out its existing duties — will need more resources in order to take on the added responsibility of regulating hemp products.
“The Cannabis Control Commission has been vocal about the need to regulate intoxicating hemp and we’re happy to see action toward closing a loophole created by a federal law,” Ahern said in an emailed statement. But the agency’s proposed 2026 budget “is not adequate even for our current needs,” Ahern said. “We look forward to collaborating with the Legislature to obtain the resources we need to include these potential statutory updates in our mission of overseeing a safe, equitable cannabis marketplace in Massachusetts.”

,DC,2025-06-10 17:49:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Five questions and answers about reconciliation in the U.S. Senate,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/five-questions-and-answers-about-reconciliation-us-senate,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. Senate will spend the next couple weeks defending the party’s “big beautiful bill” against Democratic criticisms and attempting to pass a final version that can win 51 votes.Reconciliation, the name for the process under which the massive bill is being considered, comes with a lot of rules in the Senate, including that every proposal in the bill addresses federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit. And language addressing the first two cannot be deemed “merely incidental,” or it gets kicked to the curb.Reconciliation is also favorable for the party in power, in this case Republicans, since the bill is not subject to the legislative filibuster. That means the GOP will need no more than a simple majority for passage.As you watch and read about Senate action during the coming weeks, here are the answers to five questions about reconciliation and other ways in which Congress sets a budget and allocates taxpayer money:Q: Where does reconciliation fit in with everything else that’s happening, like the president’s budget request, the budget resolution Congress approved earlier this year, the appropriations bills and rescissions?A: Yeah, they really don’t make this easy.The president’s budget request is a proposal that serves as the starting point for lawmakers’ work on a variety of fronts, including the annual appropriations bills. Nothing in the president’s budget request becomes real unless Congress takes action.Congress’ budget resolution is separate from that request. It is a tax and spending blueprint that lawmakers are supposed to use to plan the country’s financial future for the next decade.It is not a bill and cannot become law, but when the House and Senate adopt a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions it unlocks the process Republicans are now using to pass their ""big beautiful bill"" — reconciliation.Reconciliation bills move through Congress similar to how a regular bill becomes a law. However, in the Senate, the political party using the process must defend its work to the parliamentarian, who ensures the legislation complies with the Byrd rule, which is actually a law.In a process separate from this are the dozen annual appropriations bills, which is how Congress, with its power of the purse, funds the departments, agencies and programs that most people picture when they think about the federal government.Those bills account for about one-third of federal spending. The other two-thirds comes from mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that lawmakers designed to run outside of the annual appropriations process.Congress is supposed to approve the appropriations bills by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1, but lawmakers rarely complete the work before their deadline and typically have to use a stopgap spending bill to give themselves more time to negotiate full-year government funding bills.This is why there could still be a partial government shutdown later this year, even though Congress has already adopted a budget resolution and will likely pass a budget reconciliation package in the months ahead.Yet another process related to government spending is a rescissions request, which Trump sent to Capitol Hill earlier this month. It asks lawmakers to claw back funding approved in an earlier appropriations bill.Just making the request allows the White House budget office to freeze funding for 45 days while the House and Senate debate the proposal. Senate approval of a rescissions bill is not subject to the chamber’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, so Democratic opposition won’t stop it from becoming a reality if the vast majority of GOP senators vote to cut the previously approved spending.Q: What are the rules for budget reconciliation bills?A: Again, remember that in general, this type of legislation must address revenue, spending, or the debt limit. Neither political party can use the process to change policies unless they have a significant impact on federal coffers.For example, Democrats had to remove a provision that would have raised the federal minimum wage from a reconciliation bill they passed during the Biden administration because the parliamentarian ruled it was ""merely incidental.”Q: Why didn’t the bill have to go through all these extra steps in the House?A: Congress established the reconciliation process in a 1974 budget act and passed its first reconciliation bill in 1980. But it wasn’t until 1985 and 1986 that the Senate put extra guardrails in place.The Byrd rule got its name from West Virginia Democratic Sen. Robert C. Byrd, who argued that the reconciliation process needed to be more focused on budgetary issues. The Byrd rule evolved a bit over the years before being made a statute in 1990.The Byrd rule requires each provision to change revenue or spending in a way not deemed “merely incidental.” Also, committees that receive reconciliation instructions in the budget resolution can only write bills within their jurisdiction and those committees must work within their reconciliation instructions’ fiscal targets.In addition, proposals cannot increase the deficit outside the 10-year budget window and the package cannot change Social Security.Q: What is a vote-a-rama?A: Senate floor debate on a reconciliation package is much different than in the House, where GOP leaders were able to block any amendment debate.The Senate is required to hold floor votes on reconciliation amendments and this usually leads to a vote-a-rama, where lawmakers debate dozens of amendments overnight and sometimes well after sunrise.Democrats are likely to focus their amendments on proposals in the reconciliation bill that at least four GOP senators do not support, since that’s the minimum number Democrats would need for any of their amendments to be adopted. Republicans control the chamber with 53 votes and a tie-breaking vote from Vice President J.D. Vance.GOP senators are likely to call for votes on their own amendments, though typically leaders try to work out many of the final details before the bill comes to the floor, to avoid potentially divisive votes.Q: How often does Congress use this process to approve legislation?A: Congress has approved 27 reconciliation bills since 1980, with 23 of those becoming law. Former President Bill Clinton vetoed three and former President Barack Obama vetoed one, according to a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.During the last decade, Congress approved three reconciliation bills — Republicans’ 2017 tax law; a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package Democrats passed in 2021; and Democrats' signature climate change, health care and tax package, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, in 2022.If you’re interested in reading more about budget reconciliation, here is another explainer from earlier this year.",,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a slew of bills Tuesday, including one requiring social media platforms to delete deepfakes, or AI-generated sexual depictions of people created without their consent.
Brooke’s Law, named after the Jacksonville teen who spearheaded the proposal, also requires platforms to create by Dec. 31 a process for people to submit requests to remove the sexually explicit content within 48 hours.
While she was a minor in high school, Brooke Curry, daughter of the former Jacksonville mayor, had a picture taken from her social media and sexually altered using AI without her consent.
“Brooke’s Law is not just about me, it’s about all of us. It’s about accountability, dignity, and hope for every person who has been exploited or violated,” Curry said during the bill signing ceremony.
Companies that don’t make good faith efforts to remove deepfakes would violate the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, meaning the state could pursue damages and civil penalties.
Meanwhile, the governor criticized Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” for a provision prohibiting states from regulating AI for 10 years.
“They can depict you doing awful things. That’s not the world that we want to live in, and so I think that the states need to be able to retain their ability to handle the emerging AI issues,” DeSantis said. “We’re not going to run away from it.”
DeSantis signed three other bills: HB 777 increases penalties for luring children; HB 1351 requires convicted sexual predators to report in-state travel; and HB 1455 establishes mandatory sentences for repeat offenders of sexual offenses.

Photo by Andrew VonBank/Minnesota House Info.The narrowly divided Minnesota Legislature passed the smallest of changes to the state’s paid family leave program and paid sick leave mandate, rejecting more significant reversals sought by Republicans and some moderate Democrats.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, said failing to make larger changes to the two laws was one of her party’s most significant disappointments of the session.
“Those are things that we really wanted to get done … We couldn’t find bipartisan agreement,” Demuth said following a marathon one-day special session on Monday.
Democrats were largely able to protect their progressive agenda from 2023 even while passing a smaller budget in the face of a gloomy economic forecast. The notable exception is repealing MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults at the end of the year, a key priority for Republicans.
Employers and workers may never even notice the change passed to the paid family leave program, which reduces the maximum payroll tax from 1.2% to 1.1%. The program is slated to start next year with a payroll tax of .88%, with employers paying at least half of the cost, and may never rise to meet the cap, depending on demand.
The program is slated to start on Jan. 1 with workers eligible to take up to 12 weeks of family leave and 12 weeks of medical leave — or 20 weeks total in a single year. To qualify, workers must have earned at least $3,700 in the past year, with benefits based on a workers’ wages up to about $1,400 a week.
The changes to the earned sick and safe time law may similarly go unnoticed by the vast majority of workers. The law, which took effect in 2024, will continue to require employers to provide one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked up to 48 hours a year — i.e., six paid sick days a year for full-time employees.
Under the bill, an employer may require an employee to provide documentation — such as a doctor’s note — that their earned sick or safe leave is covered after two days, down from three days in current law.
The bill adds that a worker may voluntarily find a replacement for a missed shift, but the law will continue to bar employers from requiring workers to find a replacement.
The bill also explicitly authorizes a practice that was already permitted but caused some confusion, allowing employers to advance earned sick and safe time to an employee based on the number of hours an employee is expected to work, providing additional time if that estimate falls short.
The laws made it through the legislative session mostly unchanged despite a push by moderate Democrats in the Senate to reduce the total number of paid family leave weeks to 14 in a year and carve-out small employers. Moderate Senate Democrats also supported carving out small businesses and farms from the sick time mandate. House Democrats were unified in their opposition to those changes.
Rep. Dave Pinto, DFL-St. Paul, said the small changes go further than most Democrats wanted but still maintain the integrity of paid family leave and sick time.
“These are programs that make Minnesotans stronger,” Pinto, co-chair of the House labor committee, said on the floor before passage of the omnibus jobs and workforce bill, which the governor is expected to sign.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/050223-PHOTOfeature-Paid-Family-Leave-Support-AV-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Outside of Glenn Valley Foods, community advocates, including a pastor, said they had seen people being removed from the plant. Some were placed in three 15-passenger vans. Others were loaded onto a bus with boarded up windows and a law enforcement escort.
Witnesses who were afraid to give their names told a reporter they saw family members of workers arrive and try to bring documentation to their loved ones. One didn’t stop when asked to by local officers.
That resulted in a tense moment when a handful of people approached a law enforcement vehicle and some loudly expressed frustration with the scope and scale of the operation. At least two people tried to block the movement of the vehicle and were moved, video footage confirmed.
Workers targeted
Several observers said Glenn Valley was approached by ICE agents Tuesday morning and allowed agents inside the plant.
Gary Rohwer, owner and CEO of Glenn Valley Foods, told Omaha’s WOWT that federal investigators told him 97 employees had false IDs. He said the company had used e-Verify.
Immigration authorities confirmed to a local member of Congress that 75 to 80 people had been detained. Others were being interviewed about related law enforcement concerns.
“They’re good, hardworking, honest,” he said. “They’re part of our family.”
Community leaders said workers have told them they were separating people in the plant they could prove were citizens and those that they couldn’t.











These were individuals that were literally at work, trying to provide for their families, people contributing to our local economy.

The operations had several local elected Latino leaders visiting various work sites, some South Omaha businesses shutting their doors for the time being and area residents checking in with each other in a frenzy.

Latino leaders tracking the situation, posting about it on social media and speaking with workers said they had heard of up to a half-dozen worksites where federal immigration agents may have visited.

A federal official described the raid at Glenn Valley Foods as likely the largest in Nebraska since Trump took office after promising a massive crackdown on illegal immigration.
“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and federal law enforcement partners, executed a federal search warrant at Glenn Valley Foods, today, based on an ongoing criminal investigation into the large-scale employment of aliens without authorization to work in the United States,” said a statement from Tanya Roman, ICE spokesperson.
She said the investigation is ongoing.
Roman, in a follow-up call with the Examiner, clarified that Glenn Valley was the only Omaha-area operation federal immigration agents carried out Tuesday and that it attempted no others and made no individual arrests at other businesses.
Community leaders began gathering early Tuesday at a South Omaha location, after having heard late Monday of possible enforcement activities ahead.
Roger Garcia, chairman of the Douglas County board, announced during a county board meeting Tuesday morning that he had to leave because his community was “being terrorized.”
“I have to depart,” he said. “As we speak, there’s word of at least two raids happening at this moment, so I have to go. I have to try and help.”
Law enforcement fights rumors
He was among leaders posting in English and Spanish on social media to keep the community informed. Rumors swirled for much of the day about potentially targeted businesses beyond Glenn Valley Foods, including LALA’s and JBS, processing and production plants in the eastern part of the city. A JBS official told the Nebraska Examiner that no raid or immigration agents targeted JBS. LALA officials said they were not targeted and received no visit either.
Later, Garcia, gathering with others on South 24th Street, said he found no redeeming value in the federal action.

“None of this is doing anything to positively help society, but rather is doing the opposite,” he said. “These were individuals that were literally at work, trying to provide for their families, people contributing to our local economy.”
He said a team of community representatives is working to get current information, including what’s next for those detained. 
He said at least one trusted source said the source’s mom was taken to Iowa and offered the option to voluntarily deport or to fight the deportation through legal means. He said various community members have stepped up to offer legal services. 
Garcia said he’s hearing trepidation that another Nebraska town could be next. 
State Sens. Dunixi Guereca and Margo Juarez of South Omaha gathered mid-morning with a half dozen other community representatives on South 24th Street. Guereca pointed at the quiet business corridor, the heart of Nebraska’s largest Latino business district, and said: “This is fear.”
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., issued a statement Tuesday saying he understood the “concerns” for people’s loved ones and personal safety and said he had “full confidence and expectations” that ICE would operate legally and treat people respectfully. He said his office supports “the rule of law.”
The statement said his office had been told the investigation and warrant being served at the plant concerned “stolen identities.”
Local law enforcement agencies said they were not participating in the federal raids, but that they are providing agents and the public with traffic enforcement around targeted locations, as needed.
”The Department of Homeland Security recently notified OPD of the operations and OPD officers responded to the areas for traffic control,” Omaha Police Lt. Neal Bonacci said in a statement.
Business impacted
Guereca said he was disappointed in the way federal agents carried out the operation, which he said created unnecessary fear for families, customers and merchants.
“Businesses closed their doors. Not only are folks not going to work, they’re not consuming,” he said. 
Yesenia Peck, who heads the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, also came to the 24th Street district to check on businesses. As she approached one store, a customer was attempting to open the door, but it was locked.
She said she knew of at least one foreign consulate office based in Omaha, the Guatemalan Consulate, that was sending a representative to an affected worksite.

“Everybody is scared right now. Businesses are closing,” she said. “This is not life…”
Peck said one merchant asked her, “How are we going to pay the bills? Pay rent?”
Martha Barrera, who owns a salon on 24th Street, said her workers have continued to accept customers, but she said people are in panic mode about what is happening outside the doors. She said she is happy that community leaders have offered information on rights and how to respond if federal agents were to come to her business or any others. 
She and others on the business corridor said their stores rely on Latino families and are worried about future commerce.
Peck said she understands there are laws and people must abide by those.
“But this is not the way it should be done,” she said. “Not cruelly.”
“What is happening right now is unbelievable. I’ve seen this kind of thing in other countries,” she said, including her homeland of Peru. “It’s just not the right way.”
Protests gather
Meanwhile in Lincoln, an impromptu protest with roughly 20 people marched near the State Capitol as a result of federal immigration enforcement.
Peaceful protests were developing elsewhere in Omaha, too, including an “Omaha Stands with Immigrants rally.” 
Hundreds protested the federal immigration operation, lining both sides of L Street near 33rd at the dinner hours. Signs and chalked sidewalks offered sentiment: “Undocumented hands feed you.” “F— ICE.” “Keep families together” “Abolish ICE.”
An Omaha Tribal group led chants, crossing back and forth at crosslight. “No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state.”
A woman in purple plastic boots held a yellow “immigrants welcome here” sign and banged a gong, saying, “It’s the loudest thing I own.”

Others passed out “know your rights” information packets. There was no shortage of honks from passer by motorists. 
Jaqueline Chino walked up to the chanting crowd and stood on a light pole base, with her handmade sign: “Families belong together.”
Asked by a reporter what brought her to the event, she said her dad was deported when she was 5 years old.
Her mom raised her family alone, as her dad is in Guerrero, Mexico. 
“I know the pain,” she said. “Growing up without a father figure is very hard for a girl.”
Another gathering on South 24th Street drew about 25 people.
Said Anna Hernandez, an organizer: “Obviously we can’t do anything at the worksites. But we can show that this is our community and this is breaking up our families.”
She said people are reaching out to community members seeking ways to demonstrate support. “There are children who will be forever affected by this.”
Mayor, advocates weigh in
Mayor John Ewing Jr., on his second official day in office, released a statement saying that his office had been alerted that some sort of immigration action would take place on Tuesday, though was not “privy to details.”
He noted that he had asked ICE for a heads-up courtesy on enforcement activities, following the ICE-led arrest over the weekend at a west Omaha restaurant that disturbed patrons and others as it circulated widely on social media.
“I am trying to get to the bottom of what happened today,” Ewing said in a statement. “We know that actions like these affect families. My administration is working with community groups to understand the scale of need.”
Ewing said he knows the ICE actions caused fear. “We do not want people to be so afraid they stop reporting crimes. Our Omaha Police Department will respond to 911 calls and not ask about legal status.”

He reiterated that the city was not in the business of immigration enforcement, and said it was the federal government leading that charge.
“Our Omaha police officers do not and will not seek individuals to check their legal status,” Ewing said. “OPD was on scene today to assist in traffic control and public safety in areas near their operations.”
Saul Lopez, of LULAC National, was headed with other community members to pass out information about worker rights at workplaces and said a concern was for parents who might be separated from children.
“We’re very worried right now about what’s going on with the families.”
A leader of an Omaha nonprofit that works with youths said Tuesday that the organization has been working to identify families whose working parent may have been detained and separated from their children.
So far, the organization’s leader said at least two kids in their care who are from two different families have a parent caught up in the operations. The organization was busy getting a hold of emergency contacts for the kids.
Also Tuesday, immigration advocates and community leaders had turned a South Omaha organization into a sort of information headquarters to better understand and coordinate legal, outreach and response activities.
Also among the elected officials gathered at the South Omaha hub was Yanira Garcia of the Omaha Regional Metropolitan Transit Board and Omaha City Councilman Ron Hug.

June 7, 2025 | Photo by Jon KingTwo electric transmission line projects pending state approval have some Michigan residents worried that their properties could be seized via eminent domain, but they might be getting some help from the Republican-controlled Michigan House of Representatives in fighting back.
The projects proposed by ITC Holding Corp., doing business as the Michigan Electric Transmission Company, plan to build two approximately 50 mile spans of high-voltage electric transmission lines, one from the Indiana border starting in Branch County to a substation in Calhoun County, and the other stretching from Eaton County to Gratiot County. 
The projects were proposed in 2022 and are slated to cost nearly $850 million. They have been hailed by supporters as some of the first transmission line projects approved by MISO, a midwestern power grid operator, which could help bolster Michigan’s electric grid.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But the situation has some residents grappling with the possibility of an electricity rate increase that could affect all Michiganders, as well as concerns that their land might be seized in the process.
One of those residents is Marcia Klein, who began organizing members in her community to fight against the project with the hope of getting more information on the company and possibly having the lines placed underground so that whole swaths of land remain in the hands of property owners.
In an interview with Michigan Advance, Klein said she was concerned that ITC did not include a cost-benefit analysis in its applications and that the commission also noted that issue as one of their concerns. Klein also said that the company appears to be dismissive of calls to use existing utility or state land easements.
She said she questioned the company’s preferred approach to build on what is known as virgin land, untouched by other industries, and why the company hasn’t sought to route its lines through state land, which would require permitting and approval from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.
Klein further questioned the logic of new siting laws for large scale energy projects that took local control away from cities and townships and placed those decisions in the hands of the Michigan Public Service Commission.
“I’m not against progress, or electricity, the grids, the expansion,” Klein said. “It’s just the wrong place.”

She told the Advance that she felt that there weren’t enough chances for public input and that any influence over a decision is well out of their reach. Klein also said that unlike the Gotion battery plant issue last year, too few local residents or Michigan citizens statewide knew about their struggle to circumvent the project’s approval. In the case of the Gotion plant, the project has been put on hold, due in part to the large movement and political awareness that was organized against it.
“They’re just ramrodding this through,” Klein said of the transmission line project. “There weren’t enough public hearings, I didn’t get my notice [of those hearings] other than a bulk mail letter last August. … It wasn’t in the newspapers or on the air.”
Still, Klein was undeterred, and began organizing to make sure residents were informed about the issue, even as she was due for a hip surgery last year.
Some of those residents have legal representation in case they have to go to court, many of them with bicentennial farm land that is in trust and at risk of potentially being seized as a part of the project. Klein said her land is also in trust, but she doesn’t have the means to afford legal representation at this time.
Applications and ongoing proceedings were consolidated by the Michigan Public Service Commission last year. The commission most recently collected feedback on the projects at its May 15 meeting. Commissioners will meet next in mid June but it is unclear if the ITC projects will be up for discussion.
The matter was also before an administrative law judge and oral arguments were held in March. However, the administrative law judge in the case will not be issuing a recommendation, known as a proposal for decision. Those decisions typically involve an administrative law judge analyzing the evidentiary record and issuing findings for the commission to consider.
A spokesperson for the commission told Michigan Advance that, instead, the commission, which is currently reviewing the matter, will read the entire case record and base its ultimate decision on the overall evidentiary record. 
A decision to move the projects forward is expected to be reached this summer.
Commission approval is not the final battleground for residents opposed to the project, but state law makes it hard for residents to challenge those determinations or any eminent domain decisions in court.
Public Service Commission determinations are binding on state courts when deciding whether a property acquisition for a utility – much like electric transmission lines – is a public necessity, and courts typically defer to the commission’s determination.
The state’s eminent domain power also authorizes property condemnation as a pathway for a utility to acquire the rights to private land.
Klein told the Advance that it was her understanding that ITC would be seeking to carve out easements along the routes if the applications are approved. She said the company has not proposed to use existing utility company, state land or railroad easements, which she called “a disgrace.”

Among those opposed to the Eaton to Gratiot line project is Scenic America, one the nation’s only nonprofit organizations dedicated to preserving and protecting America’s scenic beauty.
In a letter dated May 13, Scenic America President Mark Falzone called for the transmission lines to be buried underground as opposed to strung up along Michigan’s skyline. 
“This project’s reliance on overhead lines threatens the scenic character of some of Michigan’s most ecologically sensitive areas and agriculturally important communities,” Falzone wrote. “Despite the common belief that transmission lines are too expensive to [place] underground, undergrounding transmission lines can prove to be a cost-effective method for electrical infrastructure.”
Klein believed the lines should at the very least be installed underground given Michigan’s recent struggle with ice storms, tornadoes and other extreme weather events that have knocked out power lines for days or weeks at a time.
A request for comment from ITC on resident concerns and the project at large was not returned at the time of publication.
As residents like Klein await the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision on moving the projects forward, they may be getting some assistance from the Michigan House of Representatives. 
A Republican-sponsored bill introduced last week aims to guarantee property owners a fair opportunity to challenge eminent domain for transmission lines, much like the planned projects from ITC Holdings Corp.
House Bill 4526, sponsored by freshman Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy), was drafted and introduced after hearing from residents in Branch County and their opposition to the line running through their land.
“State government must always protect the people’s fundamental rights – including property rights,” Wortz said in a statement. “Farmers don’t want the line to interfere with their irrigation systems. Homeowners don’t want the line too close to their houses or ponds, and they don’t want to see their trees chopped down to make way for the line.”
Wortz’s bill would eliminate the deference courts place on binding commission decisions. More specifically, the bill would instead require a transmission company to present clear and convincing evidence to a court that the proposed route of a new line was the most reasonable.
Judges would have to instead prioritize routes within or adjacent to public land, routes within or adjacent to existing right-of-ways and easements, or routes adjacent to existing property boundaries. Wortz said that approach could help limit interference with private property as much as possible.
If the commission approves the project, Wortz says area residents at least deserve their day in court.
“I’m standing up for Branch County families,” Wortz said. “My new plan will level the playing field for property owners challenging a takeover of their land.”
House Bill 4526 was introduced to the House Energy Committee last month but has yet to have a hearing.
Klein, in response to the legislation, told the Advance that she appreciated Wortz’s attempts to assist them and others who might be facing friction with utility companies looking to build large-scale projects in the future. Klein, however, feared that the slow pace of the Legislature would render Wortz’s bill inapplicable to the ITC project without giving the bill some sort of retroactive effect.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9054-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Dugan faces criminal charges after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, along with agents from the Drug Enforcement Agency and FBI, arrived in the Milwaukee County Courthouse April 18 to arrest 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz for being in the country illegally. 
Flores-Ruiz was set to appear in Dugan’s courtroom that day for a status hearing on misdemeanor charges against him. When Dugan learned that the agents were outside her courtroom, she confronted them and learned they only had an administrative warrant, which was issued by an agency official and not a judge. An administrative warrant doesn’t allow agents to enter private spaces in the courthouse such as Dugan’s courtroom. 
Later, while the agents were waiting for Flores-Ruiz in the hallway outside the main courtroom door, Dugan sent him and his attorney out a side door into the hallway. One of the agents rode down the elevator with Flores-Ruiz and he was later arrested on the street. 
Dugan-DOJ-Filing
Dugan was charged with concealing an individual to prevent arrest, a misdemeanor, and obstruction, which is a felony. Last month, Dugan’s attorneys filed a motion to dismiss the case against her, arguing she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and therefore immune from prosecution for her actions and that the federal government is impinging on the state of Wisconsin’s authority to operate its court system. 
The case drew national attention, with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel both making public statements about Dugan’s arrest before she’d even been indicted. Legal experts have questioned the strength of the federal government’s case and accused Trump officials of grandstanding to make a political point. 
In the Monday filing, federal prosecutors argued that dismissing the case would ignore previously established law that allows judges to face criminal charges. 
“Such a ruling would give state court judges carte blanche to interfere with valid law enforcement actions by federal agents in public hallways of a courthouse, and perhaps even beyond,” the prosecutors argued. “Dugan’s desired ruling would, in essence, say that judges are ‘above the law,’ and uniquely entitled to interfere with federal law enforcement.”
Dugan is set to appear for trial on July 21.

With days to go in the spring legislative session, Louisiana’s House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of Senate Bill 100, which requires agencies to track undocumented immigrants who receive state services, and Senate Bill 15, which makes it a crime for law enforcement agents, and others, to refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agencies. The session is set to adjourn on Thursday.
The bills both advance the priorities of Gov. Jeff Landry, a conservative immigration hardliner and ally of President Donald Trump.
Senate Bill 100, sponsored by Sen. Blake Miguez, R-New Iberia, which requires service providing public agencies – including the state Department of Education, Department of Corrections and the Department of Children & Family Services – to collect data and report to the State on the immigration status of people who receive those services. It passed 74-27 Monday afternoon.
Senate Bill 15, sponsored by Sen. Jay Morris, R-West Monroe, criminalizes the failure of local officials – including sheriffs and other law enforcement officers – to cooperate with federal immigration agencies, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison. It also criminalizes acts by everyday Louisiana residents deemed to obstruct or “thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts. It passed 71-30.
If Senate Bill 15 becomes law, it would directly conflict with immigration policies adopted by the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office and, potentially, the New Orleans Police Department, both of which are under federal orders to limit their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal immigration agencies.
Both have already passed the Senate. SB100 will now head back to the Senate for Senate President Cameron Henry’s signature and then to Landry’s desk for his signature.
Senate Bill 15, however, was amended in the House before final passage. The Senate will have to vote to approve the amended version before it can move on to become law.
Advocates against the pieces of legislation say the bills, once effected, will push Louisiana’s immigrant community into the shadows.
“With the passage of SB 100 and SB 15, our state has sent a chilling message: that Immigrant families and anyone seeking safety or services are seen as expendable.” said Tia Fields, who manages policy for advocacy group Louisianan Organization for Refugees and Immigrants in Baton Rouge. “Let’s be clear: these bills aren’t about public safety. They’re about punishment.”
Senate Bill 15
If enacted, Senate Bill 15 will be the first state law in the U.S. that criminalizes interference with immigration enforcement efforts, considered to be civil matters, or refusals to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.
During debate on the House Floor on Monday Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, repeatedly asked how the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office would follow the law, which directly contradicts an agency policy that was created under federal court order.
The bill requires jailers, including sheriffs, to honor administrative requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to hold an immigrant beyond their release date from jail so that they can be brought into ICE custody.
But a Sheriff’s Office policy prohibits the agency from honoring hold requests except in cases where a jail detainee is accused of a particularly serious crime. The policy exists as the result of a 2013 federal court settlement stemming from a 2011 civil rights case in which two men said they were illegally held in the city’s jail for months at the request of ICE. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, another immigration hardliner, is challenging that settlement agreement.
Louisiana already has a law, Act 314 of 2024 – enacted through Senate Bill 208, sponsored by Miguez and passed last year –  that blocks local law enforcement agencies from adopting   so-called ”sanctuary” like the one at the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office. But unlike Senate Bill 15 — which calls for prison sentences of up to 10 years — that is a civil law, carrying no jail time for failure to comply.
“The Orleans Parish Sheriff, who should be trying to get out from under the handcuffs of the consent decree, [is] using that as a shield to avoid the possible implications of refusing to cooperate with ICE,” Morris told committee members.
Will Harrell, senior program monitor for the Sheriff’s Office said while he’s disappointed that the bill passed, he is “not surprised with the outcome, given the anti-immigrant climate.” He said he’s concerned about how Orleans Parish Sheriff, Susan Hutson, will follow both the state law and the federal court order
“The sheriff does not intend to be a breaker of laws,” Harrell said. “It’s just a question of which law we need to follow.”
Senate Bill 100
Senate Bill 100 mirrors a 2024 executive order from Landry, signed in the early days of his governorship, that requires state departments and their sub-agencies to calculate and report on the amount of money that undocumented immigrants are costing the state. According to Rep. Michael Johnson, R-Pineville — who brought the bill to the House floor — Landry and Murrill requested SB15 be crafted to codify the language in that executive order.
Undocumented immigrants are already shut out of some state-administered services. They are ineligible for food stamp benefits or Medicaid, for example, and they can’t get drivers’ licenses. But they attend schools, get medical treatment at public hospitals and use emergency shelters, among other things.
Advocates against the bill said recording identifying information like citizenship or immigration status, will not only affect undocumented immigrants, but also people who may not trust their government for other reasons, making it less likely that they seek out essential services like medical care.
“Not all of these services require any kind of identification right now, [like] the low barrier homeless shelters or food banks or things like that, and there are people who are going to be unwilling to get benefits if it requires of citizenship verification,” Sissy Phleger, a safety net analyst for state think tank Invest in Louisiana, said in a phone interview last week.  “It is going to burden people in Louisiana who don’t have enough to eat. I don’t have a place to live and that seems cruel and unnecessary.”
During discussions over the bill on the House floor, Democratic Caucus chairperson Rep. Matthew Willard, D-New Orleans, expressed concern over the proposed penalties in the bill: the withholding of funding to agencies that do not comply.
“For me it seems kind of like a threat,” Willard said.
Johnson called the penalty an “incentive” to follow the law.
“This is just transparency,” Johnson said.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Attorney General’s Office plans to go to the U.S. Supreme Court a third time in an ongoing lawsuit over Alabama’s congressional districts.
The office filed notice of an intent to appeal Friday. Late on Monday, the office and plaintiffs who successfully challenged a 2021 state congressional map said in a court filing they had failed to reach an agreement in the ongoing lawsuit. 
While the state has indicated it will stick with a court-drawn congressional map that includes two districts with majority or near-majority populations of Black voters, the state and the plaintiffs disagreed on whether the court should oversee any future problems or challenges related to congressional redistricting after the 2030 Census.
“What we’ve always requested with respect to preclearance is that Alabama be put under preclearance for congressional maps through the post-2030 redistricting cycle, and that’s to confirm that there’s no backsliding after 2030 with any new district lines that get drawn,” said Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund representing the plaintiffs, in a phone interview Tuesday.

A three-judge panel in the U.S. Northern District of Alabama, which includes two judges appointed by President Donald Trump, has repeatedly ruled that the 2021 congressional map approved by the Alabama Legislature violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act by failing to give Black Alabamians a meaningful opportunity to elect their preferred leaders. The panel has cited racial polarization of voting in the state — where white Alabamians tend to support Republicans and Black Alabamians tend to support Democrats — in ordering the state to draw districts that give Black Alabamians the ability to substantially participate in the process. 
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2023 twice upheld the lower court rulings.
Federal court: Alabama Legislature intentionally discriminated against Black voters in redistricting

Messages seeking comment were left with the offices of the Alabama Attorney General and Secretary of State on Tuesday.
“They’re saying they’re not going to redistrict before the 2030 census, but they’re obviously challenging the map as well, so it’s not as if they’re giving up,” Ross said.
Alabama has until June 16 to file a brief on the position. The plaintiffs will have until June 23 to file a response, and any reply should be filed by June 27. If the three-judge panel decides a hearing is necessary, they will schedule it for July 29.
The three-judge panel has repeatedly criticized the Legislature for drawing a map in a 2023 special session that it said did not follow its guidance on drawing congressional districts. The court appointed a special master to draw the map that will now be used for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 election cycles, as well as any special election.
That map was also used in the 2024 elections, when U.S. Rep. Shomari Figures, D-Mobile, won in the 2nd Congressional District last November. That election marked the first time in history that Alabama elected two Black U.S. Representatives at the same time.

(Missouri Governor's Office photo)Legislation to void non-disclosure agreements in child sexual abuse cases was signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Mike Kehoe.
The bill has been called “Trey’s Law,” referring to the late Trey Carlock, who died by suicide in 2019 after being sexually abused by Pete Newman at the Branson-based Kanakuk Kamps.
Trey’s sister, Elizabeth Carlock, said at a hearing on the bill in February that he had to agree to an NDA as a condition of his settlement with the camp.
“Trey told someone just before his death that ‘they’ll always control me and I’ll never be free,’” Carlock said in February. “…A lot of truth dies with people because of NDAs, and that only protects bad actors, which is contrary to public interest.”
Non-disclosure agreements signed after Aug. 28, 2025 will no longer be enforceable for childhood sexual abuse claims under the new law.
Texas also passed a law banning NDAs in child sex abuse cases this session, which awaits the governor’s signature. Tennessee enacted similar legislation in 2018. 
Keith Dygert, who was also abused by Newman, reached a settlement with a non-disclosure agreement, he testified at the February hearing. But only after signing it did he learn more from news articles about the extent of Newman’s abuse and Kanakuk’s possible knowledge, he said. 
Dygert said NDAs have “undeniably prevented proper and timely healing…by silencing victims when sharing their stories in their own time, in their own way.”
He said it was worth his taking the risk of breaking his NDA to speak out.
“When victims are silenced, the truth is also silenced, and the institutions that helped enable child sexual abuse are protected,” Dygert said. 
Kanakuk director Pete Newman pleaded guilty in 2010 to seven counts of sexual abuse, and the prosecutor said Newman’s victim count might be in the hundreds. Newman is currently serving two life sentences plus 30 years in prison. 
Kanakuk leadership maintains that they had no advanced knowledge of his behavior, and Newman was a “master of deception.”
The legislation received little opposition as a standalone measure in the House and Senate. 
Versions of the underlying NDA bill were sponsored by Republican state Rep. Brian Seitz from Branson and Republican state Sen. Brad Hudson from Cape Fair.
The NDA ban passed as part of a broader public safety package sponsored by Republican state Sen. Kurtis Gregory of Marshall and Republican state Rep. Tim Taylor of Bunceton.
The bill also includes provisions to: 

Allow spouses of law enforcement officers to obtain professional licenses more quickly;
Extend the sunset date for line of duty compensation for families of public safety officers who die on duty; 
Expand the authority for state agencies to require fingerprint-based criminal background checks, 
Reauthorize the fee for the emergency response commission; 
And modernize firework laws.

“Public safety remains one of our top priorities, and with this bill, we are reinforcing that with real action,” Kehoe said in a press release Tuesday. “From improving oversight and licensing to supporting law enforcement and victims of childhood abuse, this legislation gives the state the tools it needs to strengthen public safety measures.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Organizations from around the country signed a letter on Monday urging U.S. senators not to include a controversial proposal to sell thousands of acres of federal land in Congress’ budget bill.
The letter comes in the wake of reports that Utah Sen. Mike Lee is considering reviving an amendment to the bill originally proposed by Rep. Celeste Maloy that would dispose of nearly 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah, and about 450,000 acres in Nevada.
Lee, when asked by a Politico reporter last week if he intended to reintroduce the disposal, responded, “I gotta go vote, but yes.”
Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday, and it’s unclear whether Utah’s senior GOP senator is considering bringing back an exact copy of Maloy’s amendment, or something different.
But more than 100 organizations and nonprofits around the country are sounding the alarm, telling Senate leaders to “heed how dramatically unpopular this idea is and reject any misguided attempt to get public lands sales back in this bill.”
“Decisions about the future of public lands should remain in public hands. Leaders in the House and Senate, extractive industry, and private developers are using the reconciliation process to sell off federal lands to pay for billionaire tax cuts. But such moves are deeply unpopular. Polling has repeatedly shown that the public — especially westerners — strongly believes in keeping public lands in public hands and, across partisan lines, rejects any efforts that would lead to the sale of these shared and cherished lands,” reads the letter, signed by Utah groups like the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, Conserve Southwest Utah, Save Our Canyons, Great Basin Water Network and Back Country Horsemen of Utah.

The letter is addressed to Lee, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich, the committee’s ranking member, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.
Maloy’s amendment was dropped from the budget bill after it received pushback from all sides of the aisle. That includes Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross and rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip the proposal from the bill.
“The public had no opportunity to participate in the process of identifying these parcels, let alone time to understand the long-term effect of selling off these public lands,” the letter reads.
Maloy’s proposal identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George. The land would have been used for water infrastructure (like reservoirs and wells), an airport expansion in St. George, new and widened roads, recreation and housing.

Thompson Federal as Kilmar Abrego Garcia was brought to Tennessee on criminal charges. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal prosecutors on Monday detailed legal arguments for the detention until trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration.
Abrego Garcia was returned to Nashville from El Salvador on Friday to face two criminal human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
He appeared briefly in a downtown Nashville courtroom late Friday, and is scheduled to return to court this Friday for a formal arraignment of the charges against him.
That hearing will also consider a motion by the Justice Department to keep Abrego Garcia in custody until the date of his trial, which has not yet been set.
A federal grand jury indictment issued under seal May 21 and made public June 6 charges Abrego Garcia with “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
 

Abrego Garcia “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens” for profit between 2016 and 2025 as a member of the MS-13 gang, prosecutors said.
Dumaka Shabazz, a federal public defender appointed to represent Garcia in the criminal case, declined comment on the charges Monday.
“At this date, we are not inclined to give a statement,” Shabazz said via email.
The criminal charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, court records show.
Abrego Garcia was driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men when he was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville, court records said. He was not charged in the incident.
Prosecutors now allege that further investigation revealed the stop involved Abrego Garcia smuggling migrants within the United States illegally.
Abrego Garcia faces a potentially lengthy sentence: a maximum of 10 years in prison for each person he allegedly transported.

A resident of Maryland until a prior traffic stop on March 12 this year, Abrego Garcia was dispatched within days to an El Salvador prison along with scores of other detainees.
An immigrant from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia had received an immigration court order in 2019 that allowed him to reside in the United States and specifically barred the federal government from deporting him to El Salvador, where, he said, he feared gang violence.
The prosecutors’ memo seeking Abrego Garcia’s detention until trial, filed in federal court Monday, alleges there is a “serious risk” that Abrego Garcia “and/or persons acting on his behalf will obstruct justice and/or intimidate the witnesses against him” should he be released from federal custody pending his trial.
They also argued Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and a danger to the community.
In their memo, prosecutors said they plan to raise allegations that children without legal immigration status were transported and “used in unsafe ways” to avoid detection of Abrego Garcia’s illegal smuggling activities.
Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes involving the illegal transport of children.
Prosecutors also acknowledged that, should Abrego Garcia be released pending trial, he would likely be immediately taken into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to face further proceedings in immigration court.
Nevertheless, they argued that should he not be taken into ICE custody, Abrego Garcia would have an “enormous reason to flee.”
U.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes, who presided over Friday’s brief hearing, has given Abrego’s attorneys until Wednesday to file a legal response.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s ethics code does not explicitly prevent Senate President Valarie Lawson from leading the chamber while also heading one of the state teachers unions.
That’s why the Rhode Island Ethics Commission saw no conflict for Lawson to continue both jobs, affirming the recommendation of its staff in a 7-1 vote Tuesday.
The six-page advisory opinion comes in response to a May 23 request by Lawson. Since she was elected Senate president on April 29, Lawson, an East Providence Democrat, has been dogged by doubts over potential conflicts between the legislative power position and her day job as president of the National Education Association of Rhode Island.
Senate President Valarie Lawson seeks opinion on ethical conflicts with teachers union job

Lawson attended the meeting with her attorney, Nicole Benjamin of Adler Pollock & Sheehan, but did not speak. In a subsequent emailed statement Tuesday, Lawson described the ethics panel’s decision as confirmation of what she has previously  insisted — that she can hold both positions.
“It helps to distinguish between a vague notion of a perceived, general conflict and an actual, specific conflict requiring recusal under the Code of Ethics,” Lawson said of the opinion. “Further, it ensures that one does not have to be retired or independently wealthy to serve in this role. This decision supports the operation of our legislative body as the framers intended: a part-time, citizen legislature comprised of a diverse membership from all walks of life, who can draw from their varied experiences to best serve the public.”
Lawson as Senate president earns $39,654 for her legislative job. She was also paid a $167,869 salary as teachers union vice president in 2022, the most recent data available based on Internal Revenue Service filings from the National Education Association of Rhode Island. She was elected union president in 2023, after more than 30 years teaching in East Providence Public Schools.  
But it’s probably too soon for Lawson to take a victory lap. The ethics opinion offers several caveats, noting that its recommendation cannot be tailored to any specific legislation, since Lawson’s request did not reference any bills being considered or discussed. 
If and when the Senate considers any policy or funding changes that could financially benefit Lawson, her family, or her fellow teachers union members and administrators, she must recuse herself, the opinion states. Recusal is also required on any discussions or votes in which NEARI is involved in lobbying or through verbal or written testimony.

Lawson had previously pledged in her May 23 letter to step aside when potential conflicts arise, a promise she followed through on when the Senate took up two labor-backed bills on June 4. The legislation from which Lawson abstained had proposed extending organizing rights to college graduate students and bolstering information-sharing between collective bargaining units and their members’ employers.

But the peril remains
John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, expects the conflicts to continue to crop up given the wide scope of education and labor bills still pending before the chamber this year — and in future sessions.
“Our comments have never been that it’s illegal to hold both positions,” Marion said in an interview after the meeting. “It’s just that it’s perilous to hold both positions because it’s difficult to manage the conflicts.”
Lawson is no stranger to the overlap between legislative office and teachers union priorities. Indeed, her ascension through the ranks of the Senate, starting as majority whip in 2023, and in 2024, as majority leader, came months into her role as president of the 12,000-member state teachers union. Last year, she sought ethics advice on potential conflicts between her teachers union job and proposed pension changes under consideration by lawmakers; the commission gave her the go-ahead to vote on the bills in question, invoking the class exception of the state ethics code, which lets elected officials participate in discussions or decisions that benefit themselves within the context of a larger group of people.
But the Senate president has outsized influence, setting the daily calendars for the upper chamber, participating as an ex-officio member on every Senate committee, and most importantly, leading behind-the-scenes negotiations to determine which pieces of legislation advance to a vote.
Ethics Commissioner Hugo Ricci Jr., who cast the only vote against the opinion Tuesday, cited concerns with Lawson’s new “undeniable power,” as Senate president.
Lawson’s predecessor, the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, left his own union job when he was elected to the president position, Ricci noted. 
“What I am trying to say is, could mere recusal be sufficient?” Ricci asked. “She is in a class of one. She is not a general member of the Senate anymore. She is president of the Senate. With that comes mass powers.”
Ricci’s line of questioning set off a brief but testy exchange with fellow commissioners, who insisted that they were limited to Lawson’s specific request, as well as state ethics regulations.
“We must accept the good faith of a recusal until a complaint is filed,” Commission Chairman Lauren Jones said. “If the president is saying, for the record, as she has in her application, that she will appropriately recuse herself when matters come before her, we have to take that.”
Commissioner Frank Cenerini agreed, invoking a baseball analogy.
“We have all been appointed by the governor, yet we have no problems reviewing complaints against the person who appointed us,” Cenerini said of the nine-member panel. “It comes down to an issue of character. You’ve got to call the balls and strikes as you see them. 
Ricci proposed delaying a decision to give ethics staff more time to review the potential conflict, including considering what other states have done in similar situations. But his motion failed with no secondary support.
Marion, however, acknowledged Ricci’s concerns in a later interview. The staff report recommending Lawson could preside over the Senate while keeping her union job was “somewhat naive” in its consideration of the unique powers bestowed upon the top chamber leader, he said.
“It talked about how she sets the consent calendar, but not the floor calendar,” Marion said. “It mentioned she is not on any one committee but failed to say she can participate on any committee.”
Marion continued, “I think she’ll be back before the commission on specific bills and on actions that she takes that they didn’t cover.”
Ethics Commissioner Matthew Strauss was absent from the meeting Tuesday.

Price Administration Building in Lexington. (Fayette County Public Schools)Republican State Auditor Allison Ball announced her office would begin a special investigation of Fayette County Public Schools following public scrutiny of a proposed tax increase.
She announced the investigation Tuesday morning. Last week, Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office said the school district’s board failed to give proper public notice before voting to increase occupational taxes within the district. 
“Upon review of publicly available information, as well as listening to concerns from parents and other constituents, I have determined that my office will conduct a special examination of the Fayette County Public School District,” Ball said in her statement. 
In May, the FCPS board voted 3-2 to approved an occupational tax increase of 0.25% to take effect in January. The board approved a $848 million proposed budget with the tax increase that would cost residents an average of $13 more per month, local media outlets reported. Following the attorney general’s opinion, FCPS initially planned to reconsider the tax proposal during a June 23 meeting. However, board chair Tyler Murphy said FCPS would pause the proposal, according to the Lexington Herald-Leader. 
Ball’s investigation received praise from Republican state Sens. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, Jared Carpenter, Donald Douglas, Greg Elkins, Matt Nunn and Steve West. They all represent parts of Fayette County. Mays Bledsoe previously requested the attorney general’s office review the matter. 
In a joint statement released shortly after Ball’s announcement, the senators said they are “committed to the success of our public education system and to standing with the dedicated teachers who serve our students” and have “heard from many constituents who are deeply concerned about Fayette County Public Schools, particularly regarding district spending and the board’s recent occupational tax vote, which was determined to be unlawful.” The senators said that decisions of the school district carry “educational consequences” as well as “regional economic and workforce implications.”
“Transparency, honesty, and community engagement are essential,” the senators said. “The district must practice these principles, not merely talk about them. A deeper, independent review could clarify how taxpayer dollars are being spent, identify areas for improvement, and help restore public confidence in the district’s leadership.
“We believe in our schools, we support our teachers, and we believe accountability, openness, and trust are the foundation for moving forward. If the board seeks to rebuild its image in the eyes of the public, we ask board members and district leadership to support an independent review.”
The issue isn’t completely partisan. Democratic Rep. Anne Gay Donworth, of Lexington, addressed the board during its May 27 meeting to express concern about the transparency behind the tax proposal.
Dia Davidson-Smith, a spokesperson for FCPS, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon that the school district “is committed to continuous improvement and, above all, student success.” 
“We are proud of the strategic investments we’ve made in our schools, which are leading to stronger outcomes, expanded opportunities, and meaningful progress in closing longstanding opportunity gaps,” Davidson-Smith added. “The State Auditor has the full authority to conduct a special examination at her discretion, and we welcome the opportunity to work collaboratively with her office. We are confident that a fair and thorough review of our operations will affirm our commitment to excellence, equity, and transparency in service to our students and community.” 
Previous audits and financial reports for FCPS are published on the school district’s website.
KY United 120-AFT, a teachers’ union, said that it was glad the FCPS board paused the tax proposal in a statement Tuesday afternoon. The union encouraged board members and the school district to “work together to create change in the budget process and to be better to each other and the constituents they serve” as well as work with Ball in her upcoming investigation. 
“We ask them to work with their rank-and-file staff and finally allow a vote on collective bargaining, as the need for formal staff input is much needed. We ask them to embrace the opportunity to highlight the amazing work our district provides to students but also to embrace any criticism as a call to action on how we improve — not as a political attack,” KY United 120-AFT said. 
“Trust is easily broken, but even harder to rebuild. As always, we are ready to work and will continue to show up on behalf of our kids, members, and community. FCPS is and can be a beacon for what public education can be when we all work together. Let’s thrive together.”

State of New Hampshire, on Nov. 13, 2024. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire’s Statewide Education Property Tax is equal and uniform and does not violate the New Hampshire Constitution, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday, in a blow to state taxpayers who had sued the state and alleged unfairness.
In a 3-1 decision, the court held that the tax, known as the SWEPT, is administered fairly and evenly by the Department of Revenue Administration, even though wealthier towns might collect more than they need for their schools and keep the excess. 
“Accordingly, regarding the ‘excess SWEPT’ issue, we hold that the SWEPT scheme is constitutional under Part II, Article 5 because it is ‘administered in a manner that is equal in valuation and uniform in rate throughout the State,’” wrote Chief Justice Gordon MacDonald in the majority opinion. 
The SWEPT is a mandatory process in which towns collect property taxes to pay for their schools. Under law, the state sets a goal each year for New Hampshire cities and towns to collect a combined $363 million, and each year the Department of Revenue Administration sets a tax rate per $1,000 of property value that towns must collect.
But that statewide tax rate typically results in towns with higher property values collecting far more from the SWEPT than towns with lower property values, and sometimes more than is needed to fund their schools. When the tax was enacted in 1999, those wealthier towns were required to relinquish any excess SWEPT revenues to the state to be redistributed to needier towns through the state’s adequacy formula. But in 2011, then-Gov. John Lynch signed a law to allow those towns to keep the excess, after pushback by some communities that considered themselves “donor towns.” 
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Rand v. State, had argued that because the current system allows wealthy towns to collect more in property taxes than they need, and because those towns can use the excess to lower the overall percentage of property taxes paid, the tax is neither equal nor uniform in practice. Residents of towns with lower property values pay much higher local property tax rates as a percentage than those in wealthier towns, plaintiffs said.  
Lawyers for the plaintiffs — who included Natalie LaFlamme as well as John Tobin and Andru Volinsky, two attorneys on the winning side of the landmark Claremont school funding decisions in the 1990s — had brought a motion for “declaratory judgment” to the Supreme Court. That motion was intended to allow the Supreme Court to rule quickly on the constitutionality of the SWEPT tax before the rest of the case receives a hearing in superior court, in order to lay questions about the SWEPT tax to rest. 
The court did put the question to rest Tuesday, but not in the plaintiffs’ favor. MacDonald held that the SWEPT is administered evenly because the Department of Revenue Administration applies the same flat tax rate each year to all cities and towns, wealthy or poor. Whether those towns keep the excess revenue or not, and whether some towns raise enough to pay for schools or not, does not affect whether the underlying tax is unequal and does not make it unconstitutional, MacDonald wrote.
In doing so, MacDonald dismissed evidence from an expert indicating the difference in effective property taxes between towns. 
“The plaintiffs do not dispute that under the SWEPT, as administered, taxpayers are actually assessed at a uniform rate. That concludes the constitutional inquiry,” MacDonald wrote. “The ‘effective rates’ in the expert’s data reflect, at most, an indirect effect of municipalities retaining excess SWEPT revenue, as the statutory scheme permits. Theoretical indirect effects of the scheme on municipalities are not relevant to the analysis under Part II, Article 5.”
Associate Justices Melissa Countway and Patrick Donovan concurred with MacDonald. But Senior Associate Justice James Bassett dissented on the question of the constitutionality of SWEPT. 
Responding to MacDonald, Bassett argued that under SWEPT, taxpayers in poorer towns do face disparities in taxation compared to those in wealthier towns.
“The impact of the SWEPT scheme on taxpayers in excess SWEPT communities is anything but ‘theoretical’ or ‘indirect’: the effective SWEPT rate reduction those taxpayers enjoy is real and direct,” Bassett wrote. “The impact of the SWEPT scheme on taxpayers in other communities that do not generate excess SWEPT is also real and direct: those taxpayers enjoy no comparable reduction in their effective SWEPT rate.”
The fifth associate justice, Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi, has been on administrative leave from the court since July 2024, pending a criminal case against her for allegedly interfering with the criminal investigation of her husband.
The decision overrules parts of an earlier decision by Rockingham Superior Court Judge David Ruoff, who ruled in 2023 that the SWEPT was illegal. 
The ruling does not end the Rand case; it merely answers plaintiffs’ attempts to receive a declaratory judgment on SWEPT. The rest of the Rand case alleges that New Hampshire’s adequacy formula, which currently gives a minimum of $4,182 per student to public schools that need aid, is far too low to pay for an adequate education and is unconstitutional.
The court did not rule on that question Tuesday. But it is currently considering a different school funding case, Contoocook Valley School District v. New Hampshire, in which a number of school districts have also alleged that the adequacy formula is too low to provide an adequate education. Oral arguments in that case, known as the ConVal case, took place at the Supreme Court in December. Ruoff has also ruled that the state’s formula is unconstitutionally low.
The Supreme Court’s expected ruling in the ConVal decision could affect how the rest of the Rand lawsuit plays out in superior court, now that the constitutionality of SWEPT has been affirmed by the high court. In an order sent in October, the court indicated that it is unlikely to overturn the Claremont decisions, in which the Supreme Court established the constitutional requirement that the state of New Hampshire ensure an adequate education. 
Tuesday’s ruling did include a partial victory for plaintiffs. The court held that use of “negative tax rates,” in which the Department of Revenue Administration allows unincorporated towns that don’t have school districts to offset their SWEPT tax with negative rates to effectively raise no SWEPT revenue, is unconstitutional. 
But the court did not direct the state to stop setting negative tax rates. Instead, it said the process for doing so, and fixing the unconstitutional law, is in the hands of the legislative and executive branches.
“Resolving the constitutional infirmity in the State’s practice of setting negative local tax rates is the responsibility of the other co-equal branches of government,” MacDonald wrote.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Supreme-Court-Rand-hearing-1024x657.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

“We are grateful for President Trump acting quickly to get vitally needed federal assistance to the thousands of Missourians hit hard by the violent severe weather that struck our state and who are now struggling to rebuild their lives and homes,” Kehoe said in a news release. “We urge all eligible residents to apply now. The faster you apply, the faster you will receive assistance.”
The tornado did an estimated $1.6 billion in damage and is blamed for the deaths of five Missourians.
So far, the state has identified $57.9 million in public expenses eligible for federal aid and at least $18.7 million in qualifying Individual assistance needs, Kehoe’s release said.
Public agencies and qualifying nonprofit agencies are eligible for reimbursement of 75% of the cost of recovery and rebuilding. Individuals can receive up to $770 for immediate emergency needs, plus up to $43,600 to assist with home repair costs and $43,600 for other recovery costs.
A federal disaster declaration also provides emergency SNAP and unemployment benefits.
The deadline for most Individual Assistance programs is 60 days following the President’s major disaster declaration. Housing assistance may be available for up to 18 months for displaced persons whose residences were heavily damaged or destroyed.
The declaration came as state lawmakers are meeting in special session to provide disaster relief and approve state financial support for professional sports stadiums in Kansas City. 
One bill would provide a tax credit of up to $5,000 for insurance deductibles paid for damages from an area included in a disaster request. Another would authorize the Missouri Housing Development Commission to distribute funds allocated to the Missouri Housing Trust Fund to assist in housing needs in disaster areas.
A separate spending bill includes $25 million for the housing trust fund and $100 million to assist with clean-up and repairs in St. Louis.
U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a Republican from St. Louis County, thanked Trump in a statement issued late Monday.
“The St. Louis region was hit incredibly hard,” Wagner said, “and this disaster assistance is going directly to ensure our community can rebuild stronger and better than before.”

Thompson Federal as Kilmar Abrego Garcia was brought to Tennessee on criminal charges. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal prosecutors on Monday detailed legal arguments for the detention until trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration.
Abrego Garcia was returned to Nashville from El Salvador on Friday to face two criminal human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
He appeared briefly in a downtown Nashville courtroom late Friday, and is scheduled to return to court this Friday for a formal arraignment of the charges against him.
That hearing will also consider a motion by the Justice Department to keep Abrego Garcia in custody until the date of his trial, which has not yet been set.
A federal grand jury indictment issued under seal May 21 and made public June 6 charges Abrego Garcia with “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Abrego Garcia “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens” for profit between 2016 and 2025 as a member of the MS-13 gang, prosecutors said.
Dumaka Shabazz, a federal public defender appointed to represent Garcia in the criminal case, declined comment on the charges Monday.
“At this date, we are not inclined to give a statement,” Shabazz said via email.
The criminal charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, court records show.
Abrego Garcia was driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men when he was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville, court records said. He was not charged in the incident.
Prosecutors now allege that further investigation revealed the stop involved Abrego Garcia smuggling migrants within the United States illegally.
Abrego Garcia faces a potentially lengthy sentence: a maximum of 10 years in prison for each person he allegedly transported.
A resident of Maryland until a prior traffic stop on March 12 this year, Abrego Garcia was dispatched within days to an El Salvador prison along with scores of other detainees.
An immigrant from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia had received an immigration court order in 2019 that allowed him to reside in the United States and specifically barred the federal government from deporting him to El Salvador, where, he said, he feared gang violence.
The prosecutors’ memo seeking Abrego Garcia’s detention until trial, filed in federal court Monday, alleges there is a “serious risk” that Abrego Garcia “and/or persons acting on his behalf will obstruct justice and/or intimidate the witnesses against him” should he be released from federal custody pending his trial.
They also argued Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and a danger to the community.
In their memo, prosecutors said they plan to raise allegations that children without legal immigration status were transported and “used in unsafe ways” to avoid detection of Abrego Garcia’s illegal smuggling activities.
Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes involving the illegal transport of children.
Prosecutors also acknowledged that, should Abrego Garcia be released pending trial, he would likely be immediately taken into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to face further proceedings in immigration court.
Nevertheless, they argued that should he not be taken into ICE custody, Abrego Garcia would have an “enormous reason to flee.”
U.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes, who presided over Friday’s brief hearing, has given Abrego’s attorneys until Wednesday to file a legal response.

That’s why internships and career development need to be institutional priorities,"As a senior completing my final semester of college, I find myself gripped by a familiar anxiety: What’s next? What’s the plan? That has been the life-altering question spinning endlessly in my mind.
It doesn’t help that I see graduates working jobs completely unrelated to their degrees, For example, after graduation a theater major may end up doing construction. Unless they plan on singing in unison like Pirates of the Caribbean, I don’t see how that person is using their degree to its fullest potential. Or what about those heading back to school for another degree entirely. Why is this so common? What if graduate school isn’t a feasible option for everyone? It makes me wonder are students leaving college without the tools they need to succeed in the workforce. And most importantly: are we truly career-ready?
One of the most crucial tools for workforce readiness is experience. Many job listings today demand at least two years of relevant experience, especially in STEM or math-related fields. But what about Arts and Humanities majors? Where do we show our expertise in leadership, communication, or community engagement? These soft skills are essential in today’s economy, but they’re often overlooked because they don’t show up in a bullet-point list of programming languages or lab techniques.
The reality is this: a college degree alone is no longer a guarantee of career readiness. That’s why internships and career development need to be institutional priorities—not optional resources buried deep in a university’s website. For students to be truly prepared for life after college, schools need to equip us with more than just knowledge; they need to help us build real-world experience, transferable skills, and a sense of direction.
But the problem remains: students often don’t realize the real-world skills they’re already developing in class—because no one is clearly connecting the dots. Professors may intentionally design assignments that build communication, analytical thinking, or leadership, but unless that purpose is explained, those skills go unrecognized and unarticulated by students. Faculty should be more intentional about naming and nurturing these competencies. Doing so would allow students to see their education not just as abstract knowledge, but as preparation for meaningful employment.
Colleges also need to make internships more accessible. Internships offer students hands-on learning that can’t be replicated in a lecture hall, but not every student can afford to take on an unpaid position. This is especially true for first-generation students, students of color, or those who work part-time or full-time while attending school. Schools should create more paid internship pipelines, partner with local businesses, and offer stipends or academic credit where financial barriers exist.
Another pressing issue is value—or the lack thereof. Many students don’t believe their degree was worth it. Around one in three recent bachelor’s degree recipients say college wasn’t worth the money. And the disparities deepen by gender and race: women are less likely to earn family-supporting wages, and Black graduates report the lowest levels of post-college satisfaction. These statistics are not just disappointing; they’re a call to action. Institutions must do more to ensure that education leads to opportunity for all students, not just a privileged few.
So, what can be done? Faculty and staff must expand their teaching and advising beyond the classroom. It’s time to be honest with students—not just about the curriculum, but about the reality of the job market and the skills needed to succeed in it. Many professors were once in the same position we are now. Sharing those journeys, mentoring students through uncertainty, and helping them link their studies to real-world outcomes can make all the difference.
Career services also need an upgrade. A once-a-year career fair isn’t enough. Students should be engaging in career planning starting in their first year—not just scrambling in their final semester. Schools could integrate career modules into general education courses or host job shadowing programs that expose students to various industries early on.
At the same time students must take the time to be proactive and seek out this information. Because these resources can be readily available, and because its not being used it will eventually just sit there and gather dust.
If colleges commit to bridging the gap between education and employment, students will no longer feel that their time in school was wasted. They’ll see it for what it should be: an investment in their future. One that pays dividends—not just in knowledge, but in opportunity.

As soon as the skies clear after a hurricane hits eastern North Carolina, Larry Baldwin climbs in the passenger seat of a single-engine plane, usually with his friend and pilot Rick Dove, and surveys the industrialized swine farms inundated with flood water.
“It’s almost indescribable. You look down and see that they’re either flooded or sides of a lagoon—we call them cesspools—are completely blown out,” said Baldwin, the Waterkeeper Alliance’s coordinator for Pure Farms Pure Waters, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger regulations over factory farms.
Meteorologists are predicting an above-average hurricane season, which began June 1. If a storm hits eastern North Carolina this year, flooding could jeopardize the structural integrity of hundreds of industrialized hog farms, whose massive open-air waste lagoons are vulnerable to hurricanes and heavy rain, an Inside Climate News analysis of publicly available flood maps and a state permit database shows.
As of March, there were 8.1 million hogs in North Carolina concentrated animal feeding operations, also known as CAFOs.
Of the 129 permitted swine operations in Bladen County, about 20 percent lie less than 1,000 feet from flood-prone areas. Closer to the coast, in Pender and Craven counties, the figure is 40 percent.
Removing farms from the 100-year floodplain is critical for the environment and public health. If lagoons overtop, millions of gallons of urine and feces can contaminate residents’ yards, private drinking water wells, rivers, creeks and wetlands with E. coli and other harmful bacteria.
But complex USDA requirements, delays related to the COVID pandemic and underfunding have hampered the state in finishing its voluntary swine farm buyout program.
The program receives funding from the USDA’s National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and the state legislature. President Trump has proposed cutting the NRCS budget by 88 percent, from $916 million to $112 million, part of his plan to shrink the federal government. The state Department of Agriculture uses the money to purchase permanent conservation easements on properties within the 100-year floodplain that are currently used for swine production.
Farmers bid on an amount they would accept to relinquish their permit to operate a concentrated animal feeding operation, known as a CAFO, in the 100-year floodplain and to allow the state to establish a conservation easement on the property.
Applications are ranked based on several criteria: the facility’s history of flooding, distance to a water supply or high-quality waters, structural condition of the lagoons and the elevation of the hog barns and lagoon dikes in the 100-year flood plain.
If accepted into the program, farmers can still use the land for other agriculture, such as pasture-based beef, row crops, hay and vegetable farming, but it would prohibit using the easement area as a spray field for swine waste. This disposal system sprays liquid waste from the lagoons onto nearby farm fields as fertilizer. The lagoons are also closed when the conservation easements are put in place.
Demand for the program has exceeded funding. A total of 149 swine operations have bid in at least one of the five buyout rounds. The state has purchased easements on 45, at a cost of nearly $20 million, according to Department of Agriculture figures.
Of that amount, USDA has contributed over $1 million.
The purchases total 1,288 acres of easements and represent the removal of 62,300 hogs and 108 lagoons from the floodplain.
Will Summer is executive director of the state’s Land and Water Fund, which awards grants to the state Agriculture Department for the buyout program. He said “the timing and availability of federal matching funds have further delayed project implementation.”
The USDA did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
David Williams, director of the state’s Soil and Water Division, who has run the program since its inception, said the USDA has been cooperative, but “it’s been challenging” to make specific conditions at the farms fit with federal requirements.
For example, USDA limits the percentage of concrete or asphalt—impervious surface—on a farm that has applied for a buyout. It was difficult for a smaller operation to meet that requirement because it had less acreage, Williams said, so that farm’s easement was purchased solely with state funds.
The state legislature funded the first round of buyouts in 1999, after North Carolina was hit by a trifecta of strong hurricanes within two months. Hurricane Floyd dropped 17 inches of rain on the eastern part of the state, where floods overtopped waste lagoons and killed at least 100,000 hogs.
After four successful buyout rounds, the legislature stopped funding its share of the program in 2007. That stranded dozens of CAFOs in the flood plains and left a backlog of roughly 100 farmers who had applied for a buyout.
The value of the program became apparent during the 2016 storm Hurricane Matthew. State agriculture officials reported that 32 farms, accounting for 103 lagoons, would have been inundated had they not been removed from the flood plain.
Then came Hurricane Florence in 2018, which inundated eastern North Carolina. Six lagoons were damaged, another 32 overtopped and nine were flooded, state records show. Without a dedicated funding source, the state Department of Agriculture cobbled together $5 million to restart the program. The legislature later kicked in another $5 million.
Recently, the state Agriculture Department received two more grants to purchase easements: $2.5 million from USDA and an additional $719,000 from the state’s Land and Water Fund.
That’s only a small portion of the $20 million it would cost to purchase easements on the remaining swine farms that have applied for the program, Williams said.
That doesn’t include the hundreds more farms located next to the flood zones. Some barns and lagoons are as close to a floodway as the distance between home plate and first base on a Major League Baseball field.
The risks also don’t account for the enormous poultry operations and the millions of birds that farmers co-locate with their swine operations. “You see a poultry farm, and right across the field there’s a swine farm, and sometimes there are cattle grazing in the same fields,” Baldwin said.
With a few exceptions, the location of those poultry farms and their waste disposal sites aren’t public record under state law. The only way to locate the poultry CAFOs is to fly over them, consult aerial maps or plow through building permits.
“The poultry issue has become as big, if not a bigger, problem,” Baldwin said. In flood-prone Robeson County, one poultry farm has 48 barns, holding a total of nearly 1.7 million birds.
Baldwin said post-storm flooding is significantly problematic. “Millions of gallons of hog waste, plus poultry waste and in some cases, waste from treatment plants. The water quality is just horrendous,” he said. “I like to use the term ‘petri dish,’ because that’s what it is.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hog-Farm-eastern-NC-Rick-Dove-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

The Trump administration is proposing a change to how people convicted of crimes can have their gun rights restored, raising concerns over what this means for victims of domestic violence.
The Democratic Women’s Caucus and the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force of the U.S. House of Representatives sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Robert Hinchman, senior counsel at the Department of Justice (DOJ), criticizing an interim final rule that would move the responsibility for determining if someone gets their gun rights back from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to the Office of the Attorney General. While the ATF is part of the DOJ, the letter says the proposal would create “an apparent lack of an objective, holistic process for making” these decisions.
In the letter, shared exclusively with The 19th, these U.S. House members underscored that the “restoration of firearm rights should not come at the expense of a woman’s right to live free of violence.”

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

The Department of Justice pointed to the Q&A section on the ATF website about restoring gun rights and said the attorney general can grant such restoration if they believe “the applicant will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of relief would not be contrary to the public interest.” It did not directly respond to a question on the reason for the rule change.
Emma Brown, executive director of the gun violence prevention group GIFFORDS, which endorsed the letter, said the rule change could have a significant impact because it jettisons an established process without clearly replacing it.
“The state of safety for American women is dire and the Trump administration is making it worse,” Brown said.
Approximately half of all women murdered in the United States are killed by a current or former domestic partner and guns are the most common weapons used in domestic violence homicides. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of all mass shooters have histories of domestic violence. Since the inception of the federal background check system, over half a million domestic abusers have been blocked from buying firearms.
The letter also raises concerns about the potential abuse of power, pointing to congressional testimony by a former DOJ pardon attorney who said she lost her job after refusing to recommend that actor Mel Gibson, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump who pleaded guilty to domestic violence charges in 2011, have his gun rights restored. The attorney also said the DOJ was processing appeals “without a consistent and objective process for making restoration decisions.”
Immigrants detained in Leavenworth federal prison live in squalor without sunlight, letters claim

Brown said she was concerned that friendship with the president was a reason to get gun rights restored.
“If the administration decides that it can restore firearms access to anybody, no matter what their history is on domestic violence, just because they’re an ally of the president, we have a situation where we’re re-arming domestic abusers across the country, which is a problem for the women that have been abused, but it’s also a problem for the public,” she said.
The potential new rule comes amid changes by the Trump administration that have weakened domestic violence services and prevention work. Funding pauses, cuts, firings and information purges have destabilized the infrastructure that helps victims of abuse. At the same time, federal teams dedicated to preventing sexual violence are being decimated. Departments in charge of administering grants that fund shelters for those fleeing assault have been deemed “duplicative, DEI or simply unnecessary.” Last week, the administration asked Congress to rewrite federal law to fold the Office of Violence Against Women within the Justice Department into a broader grantmaking office while also cutting its funding.
Approximately 4.5 million women alive today have been threatened by an intimate partner with a firearm; 1 million have been shot or shot at by an intimate partner. Approximately 70% of intimate partner homicides involve a gun and the presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the chance that the victim will die by 500 percent.
The Gun Control Act of 1968 prohibited people convicted of certain crimes, including those with misdemeanor domestic violence convictions, from having firearms and ammunition. Just last year, the United States Supreme Court upheld a related law in an 8-1 ruling that prevents someone under a domestic violence restraining order from possessing firearms.
Rep. Debbie Dingell, Michigan Democrat and a childhood survivor of domestic violence, said she knows firsthand how frightening being in a domestic violence situation can be, especially for women and children.
“I lived it. I lived it,” Dingell said. “I kept my father from killing my mother. I hid in that closet. And when [a domestic abuser has] access to a firearm, it’s five times more likely that a woman will be killed.”
Dingell stressed that she believes in Second Amendment gun rights but also that some people should have their access to guns restricted.
“I have tried very hard to figure out how do you protect people that need protection without taking away the rights of others and we have been working really hard to accomplish this. What they’re doing is just making it more dangerous,” Dingell said of the administration’s proposed change.
Rep. Mike Thompson, a California Democrat and the chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, described the proposed rule as “kind of a rubber stamp where if someone has had their ability to own a firearm prohibited, now you’re going to bring them up and just say, ‘Well I hope you learned your lesson. Here’s your gun.’”
Republicans in Congress axed the ‘green new scam,’ but it’s a red state boon

Thompson acknowledged that given the Republican majority in Congress and the power held by Trump, “I don’t think they’re going to read our letter and have a ‘come to Jesus’ and all of a sudden change their ways, but I think it’s important to highlight this so everybody knows how incredibly insensitive, how incredibly stupid, how incredibly dangerous these activities are.”
In a statement shared with The 19th, Rep. Gwen Moore, a Wisconsin Democrat, one of the co-chairs of the Democratic Women’s Caucus and a domestic violence survivor, said: “I know what it’s like to have a gun to my head. I know what it’s like to fear for my life. We cannot make it easier for abusers to access guns. Gun rights should never take priority over a survivor’s right to stay alive. That’s why we’re sounding the alarm on this Administration’s proposed rule.”
The public comment period for the interim final rule closes June 18. Federal agencies should then review the comments and decide whether the rule will be published, revised or withdrawn.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-10 15:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As feds resume student loan collections, states try to catch borrowers before they sink",Robbie Sequeira | Stateline,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/10/student-loan-collections-trump/,U.S. Dept. of Ed is collecting on defaulted student loans for first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. CT and other states are taking action.,"Over the past few months, Celina Damian’s phone has been ringing off the hook with one bewildered, anxious question after another: “What kind of loan is this?” “Am I in default?” “Will the government really take my wages?”
“Sometimes they just don’t know where to start,” said Damian, California’s student loan servicing ombudsperson.
“I’m talking to borrowers from all ages, from new borrowers to — I have 80-, 90-year-old borrowers,” she said.
The federal government last month restarted collections on defaulted loans. State student loan ombudspersons such as Damian have become some of the only sources of contact for worried borrowers lost in a tangle of conflicting information at the federal level about their loan status and repayment options.
The U.S. Department of Education began collecting on defaulted student loans in May for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.
Federal student loans issued by the U.S. Department of Education come with fixed rates, set repayment plans and borrower protections. Private servicers handle billing, repayment-plan enrollments and defaults.
More than 5 million borrowers are in delinquency, and nearly 10 million — about 25% of the federal student loan portfolio — are at risk of default within months, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
States can’t cancel that debt, but they do register and oversee servicers operating in their states, run ombuds offices, tweak tax rules and offer outreach or limited grants — actions aimed at reducing defaults and the economic fallout.
When borrowers default, states will likely feel the economic impact. They might lose tax revenue as homebuying stalls. They could end up paying more for Medicaid and social services if borrowers need to rely on them. And students with loan debt may be reluctant to go into lower-paying public-sector work, leading to staffing shortages at state agencies.
A borrower is considered delinquent after missing a payment to the servicing companies that handle billing, repayment plan enrollments, and defaults.
Damian’s office, established under California’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights, began as a narrow statutory role but now serves as a hub for outreach, “Student Loan 101” workshops and escalated complaints to federal agencies.
Roughly 16 states plus the District of Columbia have followed suit, creating ombuds offices to guide borrowers through confusing paperwork and misinformation. Damian believes these ombuds offices should be in every state, as borrowers across the country will likely have similar questions and little help at the federal level.
“If you don’t have an ombudsperson or even just a person at the state level who can educate borrowers, that will make a difference,” Damian told Stateline. “These borrowers are trying to pay, but the system is broken. No other financial product works this way.”
Student loans became a key issue during last year’s election race, with President Joe Biden blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court in his effort to offer relief to 40 million Americans. In its waning days, his administration did forgive loans for some 150,000 borrowers under previous programs.
But President Donald Trump opposes most loan forgiveness programs, and in May, the U.S. Education Department issued a “Dear Colleague” letter to higher education institutions, reminding them of their legal obligations to help former students understand repayment responsibilities and access support.
Some conservative economists say that federal loan forgiveness and financial aid hurt all students, offering colleges an incentive to raise tuition or lower their own institutional aid.
Winston Berkman-Breen, the legal director at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit aimed at protecting borrowers and improving the repayment system, said that more than 2 million borrowers are stuck in a backlog of unprocessed applications for income-driven repayment (IDR) plans — calculated pay structures meant to keep payments affordable based on a borrower’s income.
Other borrowers have called federal agencies for help only to find that U.S. Education Department staff, including servicer-oversight teams, have been laid off as the Trump administration works toward dismantling the department entirely.
“There was an expectation to repay,” Berkman-Breen said. “But there was also an expectation that people would have access to affordable plans. That promise has broken down.”
States now have three primary tools to address student loan debt, Berkman-Breen said: enforcement actions to protect consumers, such as the 39-state lawsuit against servicer Navient; legal oversight by suing to uphold or challenge federal policy; and direct outreach to help public servants access Public Service Loan Forgiveness and similar programs.
Nineteen states now require registration for companies that service student loans, he said. And more than a dozen states align with federal policy to exempt forgiven loan balances from state income taxes.
‘Can’t wait for Washington’
Connecticut state Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, a Democrat, calls student debt “a drag on the economy,” and said states can’t afford to wait for Congress — mired in partisan gridlock over student loan forgiveness — to find common ground.
“[Student debt] is stopping people from buying homes, starting families and fully participating in the economy,” she told Stateline. “That hurts us as a state, as a city, and we can’t wait for Washington to figure it out.”
Last year, Connecticut created a bipartisan reimbursement program that provides up to $20,000 for graduates of local colleges who make payments and complete community service. The state has distributed more than $2 million so far.
Kavros DeGraw hopes the program can serve as a model, and has already talked with lawmakers in other states on possibly developing their own versions of it.
“These were people who were already paying,” Kavros DeGraw said. “It just made sense. I think it’s something that other states could explore this session, and it would provide an immense deal of relief.”
Lawmakers in other states also have considered student loan legislation. This year, New Jersey introduced bills to register education lenders and cap interest rates. Lawmakers in New Mexico, New York and North Carolina have proposed Borrower Bill of Rights legislation. Arizona has a registration bill for private servicers. None of these measures has advanced far.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than 20 states have enacted laws expanding loan forgiveness, repayment programs and servicer oversight in recent years.
Several states are also investing directly in workforce-aligned loan forgiveness: Georgia expanded its service-cancelable loan program to cover dental students working in rural areas. Idaho created a loan repayment incentive for rural nurses. Kentucky now offers $5,000 stipends to attract new teachers. Maryland authorized Anne Arundel County to launch a local forgiveness program for public school educators.

Student loan stress is not evenly distributed. Seven states, all with Republican‐controlled legislatures, report delinquency rates above 30% among borrowers required to make payments.
Mississippi leads the nation with a conditional delinquency rate of nearly 45% — meaning borrowers who should be making payments are late. That’s just ahead of Alabama, West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana, all of which have rates above 31%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
By contrast, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and New Hampshire maintain delinquency rates below 15%.
Experts say this chasm reflects deeper systemic differences, such as lower median incomes in higher delinquency states, along with weaker consumer protections and a higher share of students attending for-profit institutions or leaving college without a degree.
States also have promoted the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, established in 2007, that offers help to public service professionals. New Mexico has an outreach campaign that includes prospective teachers and health care workers. Maine has provided guidance to public defenders on how they can take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program and touts a related state tax credit on a marketing site to lure new residents.
“States can regulate and enforce, but they can’t fix the structural problems in how repayment is administered,” said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success, a research organization that advocates for students. “They’re helping around the edges, but the core system is still broken.”
A November report from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found at least 3.9 million borrowers received misleading or inaccurate bills from servicing companies.
“The repayment system is not in a good place to provide the services and repayment options borrowers are legally entitled to,” Zampini said.
The Student Loan Borrower Survey, conducted between October 2023 and January 2024, found that 61% of borrowers who received debt relief made a beneficial life change earlier than they otherwise could have. Yet borrower awareness remains dangerously low: Nearly 42% of federal borrowers have only been on the standard repayment plan, and 31% of those didn’t know other options, such as an income-based plan, existed.
In California, a major part of Damian’s job in the past few months has been to help borrowers access existing forgiveness programs.
Meanwhile, new federal policy proposals could reshape repayment entirely. The Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act would consolidate existing IDR plans into a single tiered structure, with lower-income borrowers paying flat monthly rates and higher earners contributing 8% of their income. The bill also proposes extending standard repayment terms to 30 years — raising concerns it could delay forgiveness and inflate total interest costs.
The bill passed the U.S. House and is pending in the Senate.
‘Incentive to hike prices’
Andrew Gillen, a Cato Institute research fellow who recently testified before Congress, argues that any meaningful fix must address the incentives driving rising tuition — namely, federal aid being tied directly to college sticker prices.
“The link between rising tuition and increasing aid is what drives the Bennett Hypothesis, where federal student aid, in the form of loans, can lead to higher tuition costs at colleges and universities,” Gillen said in an interview. “If we instead use the median cost of attendance to calculate aid eligibility, we remove colleges’ incentive to hike prices just to capture more aid.”
Even without agreement on blanket forgiveness, experts agree on smaller bipartisan steps: streamlined repayment, stronger servicer oversight and targeted help for borrowers with the greatest need.
“We don’t want people defaulting. We don’t want payments that are too high for people just out of school. That should be the bipartisan starting point,” Zampini said.

Thompson Federal as Kilmar Abrego Garcia was brought to Tennessee on criminal charges. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal prosecutors on Monday detailed legal arguments for the detention-until-trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration.
Abrego Garcia was returned to Nashville from El Salvador on Friday to face two criminal human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
He appeared briefly in a downtown Nashville courtroom late Friday, and is scheduled to return to court this upcoming Friday for a formal arraignment of the charges against him.
That hearing will also consider a motion by the Justice Department to keep Abrego Garcia in custody until the date of his trial, which has not yet been set.
A federal grand jury indictment issued under seal May 21 and made public June 6 charges Abrego Garcia with “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Abrego Garcia “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens” for profit between 2016 and 2025 as a member of the MS-13 gang, prosecutors said.
Dumaka Shabazz, a federal public defender appointed to represent Garcia in the criminal case, declined comment on the charges Monday.
“At this date, we are not inclined to give a statement,” Shabazz said via email.
The criminal charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, court records show.
Abrego Garcia was driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men when he was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville, court records said. He was not charged in the incident.
Prosecutors now allege that further investigation revealed the stop involved Abrego Garcia smuggling migrants within the United States illegally.
Abrego Garcia faces a potentially lengthy sentence: a maximum of ten years in prison for each person he allegedly transported.
A resident of Maryland until a prior traffic stop on March 12 this year, Abrego Garcia was dispatched within days to an El Salvador prison along with scores of other detainees.
An immigrant from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia had received an immigration court order in 2019 that allowed him to reside in the United States and specifically barred the federal government from deporting him to El Salvador, where, he said, he feared gang violence.
The prosecutors’ memo seeking Abrego Garcia’s detention until trial, filed in federal court Monday, alleges there is a “serious risk” that Abrego Garcia “and/or persons acting on his behalf will obstruct justice and/or intimidate the witnesses against him” should he be released from federal custody pending his trial.
They also argued Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and a danger to the community.
In their memo, prosecutors said they plan to raise allegations that children without legal immigration status were transported and “used in unsafe ways” to avoid detection of Abrego Garcia’s illegal smuggling activities.
Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes involving the illegal transport of children.
Prosecutors also acknowledged that, should Abrego Garcia be released pending trial, he would likely be immediately taken into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to face further proceedings in immigration court.
Nevertheless, they argued that ,should he not be taken into ICE custody, Abrego Garcia would have an “enormous reason to flee.”
U.S. Magistrate Barbara Holmes, who presided over Friday’s brief hearing, has given Abrego’s attorneys until Wednesday to file a legal response.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods /Virginia Mercury)Senate Democrats rejected several appointees to Virginia’s governing boards at various colleges on Monday, including former Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick. 
The Monday vote by the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee removed all eight appointees made by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The move, which Democratic leaders attributed to differences in political values, now puts the decision to find replacements in the governor’s hands once again. 
“The work and the oversight that we have and as chairman of this committee is to provide accountability and oversight to our prestigious institutions to ensure that those bodies align with our values and what we see in the political climate today, especially coming out of Washington, trying to make their way into our commonwealth,” said Senate Privileges and Elections Committee Chair Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach. “It is our job to stand up and protect those values, and that is what we are doing today.”
In a statement after the meeting, Rouse referred to Cuccinelli and the other seven appointees as “MAGA extremists” and “Project 2025 supporters,” who are opposed to Democrats’ progressive ideals. 
Cuccinelli’s “extreme” position on reproductive rights, his work Project 2025 — a conservative plan for how the country should operate under Republican control — and his “hateful attacks” on LGBTQ Virginians prevented Rouse from lending his support to the governor’s appointment for Cuccinelli to serve on the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors, the Democratic senator said.
“He’s a Trump crony who is simply too extreme to have a role in shaping one of our commonwealth’s flagship universities,” Rouse, who is running for lieutenant governor and facing five Democratic contenders, said of Cuccinelli.
Merrick was slated to serve at George Mason University under the governor’s appointment.

The remaining seven nominees were to serve at Virginia Military Institute and George Mason, but they were all denied by the Democratic-controlled committee in an 8-4 vote. Three Senate Republicans were missing from the meeting.
In response to their colleagues’ action, Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, and Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, defended the governor’s appointees, highlighting that the group is made up of former public servants on the state and federal levels, military service members, and private sector leaders.
“There is nothing about any of these individuals that makes them unqualified to serve the commonwealth of Virginia in any of these positions,” Sturtevant said at Monday’s meeting. “These are all highly qualified appointees.”
DeSteph and Sturtevant also questioned why a joint subcommittee made up of members from both the Senate and House Privileges and Elections Committees had not met to review the statements and economic interests of the appointees, per state code. Rouse directed the question to the subcommittee’s attorney who said he was not aware of if the subcommittee is active. 
“We have to follow the law and what the law says,” Sturtevant said, adding that any motion on the appointees moving forward would be “out of order,” “improper” and “not in compliance” with state law.
DeSteph, who was uncertain if the committee was properly formed, added that the state law says that there “shall” be a subcommittee.
“This isn’t a ‘may.’ This isn’t a ‘you can ignore this.’ This is a ‘shall,” DeSteph said. “Normally, when something is in code that strict we kind of do it. Otherwise this is Step A before Step B.”
Staff was unable to determine when the subcommittee last met or how many of the governor’s appointees have been confirmed. Rouse estimated hundreds.

Earlier this year, Democrats also blocked nine of Youngkin’s appointees, including two Virginia Military Institute Board of Visitors nominees.
 Leader sends letter to rectors

In a June 9 letter, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, wrote to all the heads of Virginia’s public universities that state code requires all governing body members to be confirmed by the General Assembly, stating that they “will not confirm individuals who do not possess the judgment, character, or willingness to follow the principles” he outlined in the letter.
Some of those principles require board members to understand their fiduciary duties, to commit to the independent governance of such institutions, and to avoid excessive partisan inclinations.
“The General Assembly takes seriously its oversight responsibilities regarding Virginia’s public universities,” Surovell wrote. “Should any Board of Visitors fail to exercise appropriate independent judgment or allow external influences to compromise their fiduciary duties, the General Assembly will not hesitate to examine the situation and take whatever legislative action may be necessary.”
The letter went on to remind university heads that they are accountable to the General Assembly and that the boards must exercise independent judgment and are not obligated to the directives of the governor.
“Virginia is proud to maintain one of the strongest public higher education systems in America,” the letter states. “Our commonwealth is home to some of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious institutions, and they deserve governance that is independent, principled, and focused solely on their academic mission and service to the commonwealth.”
State legislators are now considering other university BOV nominees, a process that is slated to continue through the end of the year.
If Youngkin plans to appoint new members to fill expiring seats, he has until the end of his term in January.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Corrections will not offer a promised diesel mechanic training program in a space once occupied by a privately run metal shop that paid inmates market wages.
Last August, the DOC and Southeast Technical College got approval from the state Board of Technical Education to expand the college’s diesel program into the maximum security Jameson Annex in Sioux Falls.
Training inmates to fix diesel engines would “create opportunities within our community to meet the workforce needs of trades careers,” according to the school and the department’s application to the board.
The application anticipated an August 2025 opening.
Private employers say they were pushed out of state prisons

Corrections spokesman Michael Winder told South Dakota Searchlight last week, however, that the school was unable to secure funding to purchase the equipment needed to operate the program inside the Sioux Falls prison.
Jennifer Lambley of Southeast Tech said ongoing debate about the potential construction of a new prison was partially to blame for the decision to freeze talks on the diesel program. The school had been in discussions with the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice on potential funding.
“We believe it’s important to pause and more deeply consider how this initiative fits into South Dakota’s broader plans for addressing long-term prison infrastructure and programming needs,” Lambley said.
Winder and Lambley both said that the school and DOC still aim to expand programming for inmates eventually.
“We remain fully committed to providing high-quality, workforce-relevant education to individuals in custody,” Lambley said.
Job training factors into prison construction talks
The diesel engine program was set to fill the now-empty space occupied for more than 20 years by Metal Craft Industries, a company that says it was pushed out of the prison system by administrators. Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko said the company left voluntarily to avoid adhering to newer, stricter security protocols.
The owner of another private business that had employed female inmates in Pierre, Badlands Quilting, also accused the state of pushing it out the door last year.
The shuttered metal shop’s status came up briefly during a meeting of the Project Prison Reset group last week in Pierre. Consultants with the firm Arrington Watkins said the shop was empty when they toured the Jameson Annex of the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls a few months ago.
The work group is focused on building options that might relieve inmate overcrowding, but its members have also focused on repeat offense rates, reentry programming, job training and post-incarceration placement.


Let us know what you think...


 

Many task force members and members of the public who’ve appeared at the meetings have argued that the state needs to do more to improve the chances for inmates who return to their communities after serving a sentence if it ever hopes to address long-term growth in prison populations.
Last week, the group voted to cap spending on a new prison at $600 million. That’s less than the consultants suggested would be necessary to build one big enough to meet current needs and address future growth projections.
Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, lamented that the cap could hamstring efforts to design a facility capable of training current inmates to become rehabilitated, contributing members of their communities.
Smith didn’t mention Metal Craft Industries last week, but the controversy surrounding its departure sparked a host of questions from lawmakers last year on the role of work programs within the DOC.
Inmates at Mike Durfee State Prison work for the Governors Home program, which builds houses, duplexes and day cares for people under certain incomes and communities that meet certain guidelines.
The state also operates a handful of shops under the banner of Pheasantland Industries, including an upholstery shop that outfits prison cells and a sign shop that prints license plates and road signs.
Metal Craft and Badlands Quilting paid inmates market wages. Some inmates paid off their restitution and child support with their Metal Craft paychecks, and employees of both private businesses paid room and board to the state. Most prison jobs, by contrast, pay about 50 cents an hour.
Some empty classrooms, but partnerships remain
During previous Project Prison Reset meetings, inmates and their family members said extended lockdowns across the system have served as an impediment to job training programs, kept shops from running full-time and otherwise hindered inmates’ opportunities to better themselves.
“There’s classrooms in here that sit empty half the time,” inmate Samuel Lint told the group through a cell phone in early April.
Prison task force rejects original Lincoln County site, tightens budget for new facility

Programs that train inmates outside prison walls have had success, though.
Twelve minimum custody inmates graduated with welding certificates from Southeast Tech last fall, adding to the 57 who’d completed the training since 2022. The welding certificate program is funded with help from the state Department of Labor.
Past cohorts have had an average graduation rate of more than 80% and a similar job placement rate, an announcement on the fall graduation said. The money from the Labor Department covered the cost of books and equipment for inmate students.
Dawn Dovre, spokesperson for the department, told South Dakota Searchlight in an email that part of the funding is from the U.S. Department of Labor.
“As always, if there are changes to these programs or budgets nationally, adjustments to service delivery will be made,” Dovre said.
The Department of Corrections also offers Career and Technical Education courses in precision machining for male offenders at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield through Lake Area Technical College.
That program didn’t field a cohort in the spring, according to Tiffany Sanderson, Lake Area’s president, but not for a lack of funding.
The former instructor left last fall, and Sanderson said it’s been hard to fill that position.
Offenders at the Rapid City Minimum Center can enroll in a plumbing course at Western Dakota Technical College. That school’s spokesperson told South Dakota Searchlight that five inmates graduated from the course this spring.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Democrats successfully beat back an attack on the state’s ban on noncompete agreements, one of their signature pro-worker victories in the 2023 session, with Republicans dropping demands for carve-outs for highly paid workers hours before a marathon special session began on Monday.
Under noncompete agreements, employees are barred from working for a competing company — or starting one — for a period of time and within a certain geographic area.
Rolling back the ban on noncompete agreements for highly paid workers and those with access to confidential and proprietary information was a top priority for Minnesota’s largest companies, whose lobbyists argued the ban jeopardized their right to protect valuable scientific discoveries and trade secrets.
Democrats rejected that argument, saying the push to revive noncompete agreements was more about stifling competition and suppressing wages than protecting trade secrets.
“There’s no evidence that noncompetes actually foster an innovator’s economy,” said Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, an author of the ban. “It actually does the opposite.”
About one in five American workers — in jobs ranging from medicine to child care — are bound by a noncompete agreement, and they cost workers more than $250 billion per year by decreasing competition, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
Under the Biden administration, the Federal Trade Commission moved to ban noncompete agreements nationwide last year, estimating it would increase new business development and raise workers’ wages by an additional $524 per year on average. A federal court later blocked the ban, and the Trump administration signaled it’s likely to reverse course.
Despite the pressure from large technology companies to repeal the ban, retired 3M chemical engineer and patent agent Jim Klein told lawmakers that Minnesota is on the right track. Klein, who managed 3M’s intellectual property portfolio for 23 years, encouraged the House and Senate labor working group to maintain the blanket ban on noncompete agreements. He said the United States has sufficient protections for trade secrets — like the Uniform Trade Secrets Act — beyond restricting employees’ careers.
“It does not make proprietary information any more secure,” Klein said.
Rep. Harry Niska, R-Ramsey, the author of the carve out, argued the ban would put the state at a competitive disadvantage, noting Minnesota is one of just four states with such broad non-compete bans. The other states with noncompete bans are North Dakota, Oklahoma and California, where the lack of enforceable non-compete agreements has been credited with fueling the immense, wealth-creating innovation of Silicon Valley.
The issue tied up the labor committee in the House for weeks until they reached a compromise that passed the House, which would have carved out workers making more than $200,000 and whose primary duties included “the creation, analysis, or modification of trade secret information.” The bill also carved out workers making more than $500,000 a year regardless of their duties.
The Democratic-controlled Senate never passed that provision and the legislative session ended without a deal, which sent the issue to a labor working group, where Rep. Dave Baker, R-Willmar, tried to revive House Republicans’ original proposal.
That would have carved out workers making more than $120,000 a year and whose primary duties include “research and development or the creation, analysis, or modification of confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information.”
Greenman called the proposal a “trojan horse” with language so broad that it would effectively allow employers to use noncompetes with any employee simply by calling their work “confidential.”
The labor working group couldn’t reach a compromise, but Baker said on the House floor on Monday night that lawmakers must revisit the issue or else large companies like Medtronic will shift operations elsewhere.
“If we don’t fix this, these other companies are going to slip away,” Baker said.

Demas photo)A citizen of the People’s Republic of China was arrested and charged with smuggling concealed biological material into the U.S. from a university in Wuhan, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan announced Monday.
The arrest of Chengxuan Han, who is currently pursuing a doctorate degree from the College of Life Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, is the third such arrest in the last few weeks related to smuggling of biological agents into the country involving the University of Michigan.
“The alleged smuggling of biological materials by this alien from a science and technology university in Wuhan, China — to be used at a University of Michigan laboratory — is part of an alarming pattern that threatens our security,” said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Jerome Gorgon Jr. in a statement. “The American taxpayer should not be underwriting a PRC-based smuggling operation at one of our crucial public institutions.”
Han is alleged to have sent four packages with concealed biological material to the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. The packages were addressed to people associated with a laboratory at U of M.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers apprehended Han on Sunday after she arrived at Detroit Metro Airport on a J1 visa. Officers inspected Han and noted that Han made false statements about the packages and the material she had previously shipped to the U.S.
The content of an electronic device Han possessed was deleted three days prior to her arrival in the U.S. this week, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
Han was next interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during which Han admitted to sending the packages and that they contained biological material related to round worms. She also admitted to making false statements to CBP officers during her initial inspection.
“The FBI has zero tolerance for those who violate federal law and remains unwavering in our mission to protect the American people,” Cheyvoryea Gibson, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office, said in a statement. “The alleged smuggling of biological materials by Chengxuan Han is a direct threat to public safety and national security, and it severely compromises the integrity of our nation’s research institutions.””
The Detroit News reported that Han was the third Chinese national with connections to U of M charged with a federal crime in the last two weeks. The FBI recently charged student Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, for attempting to smuggle biological pathogens into the country, which the agency said could be used as an agricultural terrorism weapon affecting food crops.

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)North Carolina lawmakers and community members held a press conference Tuesday morning to back legislation prohibiting ghost guns and other untraceable weapons.
Sen. Jay Chaudhuri (D-Wake) organized the event to garner support for Senate Bill 409: “Ban Ghost Guns & Undetectable Firearms.”
This measure would prohibit the sale and possession of ghost guns, which are firearms without a unique serial number. Undetectable firearms can be purchased in separate components and assembled at home, or manufactured through a 3D printing process.
Chaudhuri filed the bill in March, when it was initially introduced to the legislature and assigned to the Senate Rules Committee. The bill has not moved since then.
“At the time when the General Assembly is set on passing permitless concealed carry bills… we’re ringing the alarm bell about the need to address a real 21st century firearms threat: ghost guns,” Chaudhuri said.
Senate Bill 50, “Freedom to Carry NC,” would remove the permit process for individuals to carry concealed firearms. This legislation will be heard in the House Rules Committee Tuesday afternoon.

Sen. Val Applewhite (D-Cumberland) collaborated with Chaudhuri on SB 409. She emphasized that the measure is not about infringing on gun ownership.
“This is about untraceable, unserialized weapons, often assembled in basements or garages that are increasingly finding their way into the hands of people with no intention of using them responsibly,” Applewhite said. “These are weapons with no paper trail, no accountability, and no way for law enforcement to do their jobs effectively.”
Courtney Banks-McLaughlin, a Fayetteville city council member and appointed member of the governor’s crime commission, spoke at the conference as a grieving parent.

(Screenshot)Attorneys general in 16 jurisdictions, including Rhode Island, sued Monday to block a Trump administration plan to redistribute thousands of devices that convert guns to machine guns, including distribution in states where such devices are banned by state law.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland, said the plan would not only expose residents of those states to greater amounts of deadly violence, but it would be contrary to federal law that calls for the seizure of machine-gun conversion devices. And it would cause federal officials to “aid and abet violations of state law” by distributing the devices in states where they are outlawed, the suit said.
The decision to return almost 12,000 forced reset triggers — which allow shooters to fire hundreds of rounds a minute with one pull of the trigger — was announced in a settlement last month between the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and gun manufacturers and gun-rights groups.
“These devices enable firearms to fire up to 900 bullets per minute. The increased rate of fire allows carnage and chaos to reign on the streets,” said Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) in a virtual press briefing Monday with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin (D) and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings (D).
“Everyone nearby becomes vulnerable to serious injury or death. These are battlefield weapons that have no place in our communities,” Brown said.
Under the Biden administration, ATF classified forced reset triggers as “prohibited machine guns under federal law … and conducted extensive retrieval operations, seizing nearly 12,000 FRTs from the field,” according to the lawsuit.

But the new administration reversed course after a Feb. 7 executive order from President Donald Trump (R) on “Protecting Second Amendment Rights.”
On May 16, the Justice Department announced a settlement with Rare Breed Triggers, a manufacturer of the devices based in Wichita City, Texas. Under the deal, the company agreed not to develop or design such triggers for handguns, to promote safe and responsible use of its products, and to enforce its patents to “prevent infringement that could threaten public safety.”
In exchange, the government agreed not to enforce any policy where an FRT is “contended to be” a machine gun, and to return by Sept. 30 any reset triggers seized or “taken as a result of a voluntary surrender.”
“We won,” Lawrence DeMonico, president of Rare Breed Triggers, said in a video posted online the day settlement was announced. “With the Trump administration’s renewed focused on justice and their commitment to correcting the weaponization of the DOJ under the Biden administration, we were finally able to secure a deal that brought this fight to a close.”
Representatives with Rare Breed Triggers and the Justice Department did not respond to email requests for comment Monday.
The National Association of Gun Rights, which was also a party to the settlement, said it a statement that the deal will survive any challenge from the “anti-gun attorneys general.”
“A federal court already ruled the government unlawfully seized thousands of legal triggers from law-abiding Americans — a decision that the ATF now acknowledges and accepts,” said Hannah Hill, vice president for the association. “These states lack standing to file this lawsuit, and they know it. This suit is just reckless political lawfare.”

Besides Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, other jurisdictions on the suit are the District of Columbia and the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. All but Maine and Vermont currently have state laws prohibiting forced reset triggers or guns modified with them.
The states’ lawsuit highlights the impact of gun violence in their jurisdictions, where it said there were nearly 47,000 gun-related deaths in 2023. Illinois had the most such deaths that year, at 1,691. Of the states represented at Mondays briefing, Maryland recorded 737 gun-related deaths in 2023, New Jersey had 430 and Delaware had 124, according to the suit.
“Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from gun violence, and yet with this action, the Trump Administration seems intent on growing that staggering number exponentially,” said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha in a statement.
“Over the years, ATF has worked to remove FRTs from our streets, and this settlement agreement threatens to undo that progress,” Neronha continued. “Further, the Administration’s plans to redistribute previously confiscated FRTs back into our communities is wildly reckless, adding insult to injury in states that are already reeling from the devastating impacts of gun violence. Finally, if the federal government pushes FRTs back into states where they are prohibited by law, they are complicit in any violations that occur from them doing so. We will not accept this attack on our communities, and we will do everything in our power to stop them from aiding and abetting gun violence and deaths.”
The suit spells out the financial burden that comes with gun violence, for medical bills, police, court and prison costs. It said one fatal shooting in Baltimore can cost $2.4 million and a nonfatal shooting costs $1.5 million. In Newark, New Jersey, the cost is nearly $2.2 million for a fatal shooting and $1 million for a nonfatal shooting.
“This is not a partisan issue. It is a public safety issue,” Delaware’s Jennings said. “The Trump administration’s deal to redistribute these deadly devices violates the law, full stop. It undermines public safety and ties the hand of law enforcement.”
Platkin recalled the shooting death in March 2022, just two months after he took office, of SeQuoya Bacon-Jones, who was a bystander to a shooting when she was struck and killed. Platkin said SeQuoya would have celebrated her 13th birthday last Saturday.
“She had dreamed of becoming a law enforcement officer, but instead she was killed by a single stray bullet while she was playing hide-and-seek in the courtyard of her apartment complex,” Platkin said. “I wish the Trump administration … would put little kids like Sequoya’s interests ahead of the gun lobby’s. But since they don’t seem to care, we’re going to make them care.”

Massachusetts is cracking down on intoxicating hemp edibles, but critics say new rules fall short without funding for enforcement. 
The post House cannabis bill targets intoxicating hemp edibles, but critics warn enforcement gaps will remain appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE HOUSE PASSED a cannabis bill last week that would permit intoxicating hemp-derived beverages to be sold in licensed Massachusetts liquor stores while ordering edible intoxicating hemp-derived products like gummies off store shelves, but critics say the legislation fails to address the core problem of enforcement at the local level. 
Intoxicating hemp-derived edible products have the same active ingredient as cannabis, but are not subject to any oversight by the state Cannabis Control Commission. Sales of hemp products have proliferated across the state because of a federal loophole that defines hemp differently than cannabis. 
State agencies issued guidance last spring that declared the hemp products illegal in the state, but enforcement of the ban has remained uneven, with local boards of health complaining they do not have the resources to police hemp products and take them off the shelves in their communities. 
The House bill explicitly makes hemp-derived edible products illegal in the state, while allowing hemp-derived beverages to be sold in licensed liquor stores under the supervision of the state cannabis commission.  
The law directs local boards of health to monitor the sale of any edible hemp products, including taking samples from stores for testing, removing any illegal products, and providing written warnings of added steps that will be taken for a subsequent offense.  
Cheryl Sbarra, the head of the Massachusetts Association of Health Boards, said that local health boards don’t have the resources to carry out enforcement without added funding. “Your law is only as good as your ability to enforce it, and if you don’t have the ability to enforce it because you don’t have any money, then the law is meaningless,” she said.  
Money from taxes on hemp-derived beverages or fines the state could levy on stores illegally selling hemp-derived edibles would go to the state’s general fund.  
Sbarra said enforcement isn’t as simple as walking in and grabbing the products off store shelves. The local health boards would need to do extra inspections of stores. There would have to be a protocol for storing and testing potentially illicit products. And many local boards of health don’t have established relationships with labs that could test hemp products.  
“I don’t think this will be enforced very evenly on the local level because it will depend on who has the capacity on top of their already extremely busy jobs,” said Phoebe Walker, the director of community health at the Franklin Regional Council of Governments, an umbrella organization that serves communities in Franklin County. “What would happen is uneven enforcement, which is not good for public health.” 
Sbarra and Walker pointed out that there was language in other House bills that would have directed funding from tax revenue on legal hemp products to local boards of health, but that provision didn’t make it into the legislation that was approved last week.  
The cannabis industry has been pushing stricter enforcement on hemp products because they compete with cannabis. Cannabis business owners say hemp products are undercutting their sales with lower priced, unregulated products.  
Ryan Dominguez, the head of the Massachusetts Cannabis Coalition, an advocacy group for the cannabis industry, said the coalition supports including a funding stream in the legislation for local health boards to enforce the ban on sale of hemp-derived edibles.  
“Enforcement is important for the cannabis industry because we have seen that the all-out ban on the intoxicating hemp products, which has been in existence in Massachusetts even prior to this bill, has not been enforced,” said Dominguez. “We really want to focus on removing these products from the shelves of gas stations and liquor stores, and the way to do that is to give the local boards of health the money to do so.” 
Under the legislation approved by the House, the cannabis commission would oversee testing, labeling, and other regulations for hemp beverages, which could only be sold at licensed liquor stores.  
The cannabis bill would also restructure the Cannabis Control Commission, raise the cap on the number of retail licenses a single company can own from three to six, increase purchasing and possession limits for cannabis, and loosen existing requirements for medical marijuana businesses. 
Travis Ahern, the cannabis commission’s executive director, welcomed the move to clamp down on hemp products. But he said the commission – which has previously called for more funding to carry out its existing duties — will need more resources in order to take on the added responsibility of regulating hemp products.  
“The Cannabis Control Commission has been vocal about the need to regulate intoxicating hemp and we’re happy to see action toward closing a loophole created by a federal law,” Ahern said in an emailed statement. But the agency’s proposed 2026 budget “is not adequate even for our current needs,” Ahern said. “We look forward to collaborating with the Legislature to obtain the resources we need to include these potential statutory updates in our mission of overseeing a safe, equitable cannabis marketplace in Massachusetts.”

(Image via NPS)The percentage of Montanans who believe the benefits of tourism outweigh the negative impacts held steady from last year, but residents feel local communities are becoming more overcrowded, according to a report released in April by the University of Montana Institute for Tourism and Recreation Research (ITRR). 
The report, “Montana Residents: Attitudes Towards Tourism 2024,” is the latest survey posing a set of questions to Montanans over the last 30 years regarding their attitudes toward visitors. Overall, 68% of respondents to the 2024 survey agreed that the benefits of tourism outweigh the negative impacts, in line with last year’s 69%. 
However, it was just the fourth time less than 70% of Montanans have expressed a positive attitude toward out-of-state visitors. The lowest recorded positive attitude (52%) was in 2001, which researchers attributed to the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks. The second-lowest finding was in 2022, which followed record-breaking visitation after the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to the ITRR report, residents of Montana’s Glacier Country tourism region, which covers the state’s eight westernmost counties, remained the least likely to see tourism as a benefit, but that sentiment climbed for the second year in a row. 
However, that region of the state is also seeing a drastic visitation change this year, as visits from Canadians are down, following President Donald Trump’s threats to make the neighbor the 51st state, and prompting targeted marketing from Montana.
Residents in Central Montana saw the largest increase in positive sentiment, up to 70%, while residents of Southeast and Southwest Montana dropped their views on visitors.
“In general, Montana residents held a positive yet balanced attitude toward tourism within the state,” the report said. “A majority of residents feel that the benefits of tourism outweigh the negative impacts, while also being in strong agreement that tourism promotion by the state provides an economic benefit to their community.”
In Montana out-of-state visitors spent nearly $5 billion in 2024, contributing to the state’s robust outdoor recreation economy.  
However, the state was split on other nuanced views about tourism.

Forty-two percent of respondents said they felt the state was becoming overcrowded from tourists, while the same percent disagreed with that statement. Compared to 2021 — one of the most crowded years for tourism in Montana — significantly fewer respondents (14%) felt overcrowding was an issue. 
On a local level, more residents felt their communities were becoming overcrowded by tourists, with 47% responding that during the summer travel season they were seeing too many visitors. While that represented a 7% increase from the 2023 survey, the report notes that the responses heavily varied by region. 
Yellowstone Country and Glacier Country, the tourism regions associated with their eponymous national parks, 72% and 67% of respondents, respectively, felt tourists were overcrowding their communities. In contrast, only 23% of Central Montana respondents and 12% from Missouri River Country had the same sentiment.  
The survey also asked respondents if they felt the overall quality of life for Montana residents would improve if tourism were to increase. Overall, 35% of Montanans said that quality of life would improve with increased tourism, compared to 38% who felt it would decrease.

As the region with historically the most negative attitude towards tourism, Glacier Country, officials working to promote western Montana have worked to change the way they market the area.
The Glacier Country Regional Tourism Commission is a nonprofit that partners with Western Montana communities to “welcome visitors and support livelihoods while protecting quality of life, extraordinary outdoor resources, and cultural heritage.” 
Following droves of pandemic-era tourists in 2021, Glacier Country Tourism held a series of community meetings to discuss how to shift their marketing approach to a more sustainable model for communities. A new long-term collaborative “Destination Stewardship Strategy” was launched aimed at promoting smaller communities that wanted more visitors while pulling back from some mainstream destination marketing centered around Glacier National Park and Whitefish – core economic anchors for the region’s tourism industry. 
Another set of community listening events was held in 2024, and Glacier Country Tourism President Racene Friede said many of the conversations showed their strategies had accomplished many of the goals. 
“Tensions towards tourists were still a little high, but we came out of a lot of those community meetings feeling like one, we really heard what people were thinking deep down, and we also were able to make sure these communities felt like they were being heard,” Friede said. “It felt very validating to the work we’d done after what we heard in 2021.”
One nuance Friede said she discussed with many communities across Western Montana was the issue of overcrowding, which she said isn’t perfectly correlated with increasing numbers of tourists. 
“Those tourists are here, but they’re also mixed with a lot of new residents, and that means there’s more new people in the community, year round,” she said. “Some audiences were really interesting to talk with when they extracted that particular point.”
Recent census data shows that Kalispell has been one of the fastest growing cities in the nation since 2020, with most western counties seeing significant growth as well. 
While Friede said these regular community input sessions help shape long-term visitation and marketing strategies for the region, the Tourism Commission also responds to short term changes to visitor patterns. 
“Weirdly,” she said, the region is looking at a shortfall of visitors at the moment, mostly from a decrease in Canadian travel due to inflammatory rhetoric between the federal government and the neighbors to the north. 
“Over 50% of the businesses that replied to a survey I sent out said business is down compared to last year at this point,” Friede said. “The closer you are to the border, the more businesses are feeling it, and they’re really worried.”
“It’s a whole different world this year than we expected to see,” she added. 
Friede said the commission recently launched a short-term marketing campaign targeting Canadian cities near Montana, promoting it as a weekend destination. 
“I wasn’t even thinking about that six weeks ago,” she said. “But we’re focused on people over politics, letting the Canadian people know that we’re here when they’re ready to visit, and we can’t wait to welcome them back.” 
She said the organization being nimble and able to react and respond to different local needs throughout the year is essential.
“We can’t control who’s coming here, but we can control what role we play and how they impact our local communities,” Friede said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/42286140251_715a3ac13d_k-e1734982172919-1024x577.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)After a push from Republican lawmakers, a public hearing for a red flag bill is scheduled for Wednesday. 
The Maine Legislature’s Judiciary Committee will hold a public hearing for LD 1378, which was born out of a citizens initiative process, at 3 p.m. on Wednesday — one week before the Legislature is set to adjourn for the session. 
Red flag laws, formally known as extreme risk protection orders, are a mechanism to temporarily confiscate one’s firearms if they are deemed to be a threat by law enforcement or their family members. Maine’s current “yellow flag law” allows law enforcement officials to take away guns from someone considered a safety risk to themselves or others after an evaluation from a mental health professional.
For several weeks, Republicans have been questioning why a public hearing was never scheduled for the proposal, which is already set to appear on the November ballot for voters to decide on. 
In a late night Senate session last Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook) attempted four maneuvers to force a public hearing for the bill. He argued that they are obligated by state law to hold a hearing, but his attempts were unsuccessful at the time. Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland) said the Judiciary Committee still had possession of the bill, essentially saying it is up to the committee to decide what to do with it next. 
However, after another late Senate session Monday, the Judiciary Committee sent out a public hearing notice. 
“The ‘red flag’ bill isn’t a referendum to change the state flag,” said Assistant Senate Minority Leader Matt Harrington (R-York) after the meeting was announced. “It is a proposal that infringes on one of our most protected rights.”
The red flag proposal was brought about after the Maine Gun Safety Coalition collected more than 80,000 signatures in about two months in support of the initiative. Similar legislation was introduced last legislative session, but it died without a vote in the full Senate or House of Representatives.
The Judiciary Committee held a public hearing in April 2024 for last session’s proposal amid criticisms of the state’s yellow flag law, which has faced scrutiny since an independent commission found that it should have been utilized to remove firearms from Robert Card II, who perpetrated the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston.

In 2024, it was hard to avoid the barrage of ads making the case for one side or the other of some ballot questions. But it was a very different story when it came to seeing who was funding the campaigns. 
The post A push for more transparency on ballot question spending, fundraising appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","BALLOT QUESTION COMMITTEES, hoping to convince voters to vote “yes” or “no” on their respective proposals, ranging from the elimination of the MCAS test as a graduation requirement to an audit of the state Legislature, spent tens of millions of dollars last year.  
It was hard to avoid the barrage of ads making the case for one side or the other of some ballot questions. But it was a very different story when it came to seeing who was funding the campaigns.  
For an eight-month period during the heat of these campaigns – from January to September – ballot question committees were not required to report their fundraising and spending activity to the state campaign finance office, which makes public such filings on its website. The disclosure rules are far stricter for candidates for statewide office, legislative seats, and other posts, who must file monthly reports during the same period. 
CommonWealth Beacon reported during last year’s campaign on the stark difference in finance disclosure requirements for candidates and ballot campaigns, which good-government advocates decried as loophole that should be closed. Now, two Boston-area lawmakers have filed legislation to do just that.
Sal DiDomenico, the state Senate’s assistant majority leader, and Boston state Rep. Dan Ryan have each filed a bill in their respective branch that would require ballot campaigns to file monthly reports. 
The bills would “close a hole in our campaign finance law and ensure our residents have all the information they need to make an educated decision when voting on a ballot question,” DiDomenico, an Everett lawmaker, said in a statement. 
“Massachusetts voters deserve to know, in real time, who is funding the ballot questions that will impact their lives,” said Geoff Foster, the executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, a nonpartisan advocacy group that pushes for election reforms. “The Ballot Spending Transparency Act will empower voters with this valuable information, ensuring big-money special interests can’t go undetected when they try to buy their preferred policies.” 
Under current law, ballot committees are required to file an initial report when they first organize, then another report in January of the election year. Then they don’t have to file again until two months before the election. The committees then switch to reporting every several weeks until the November election. 
Common Cause Massachusetts tallied the last six election cycles, spanning a decade, and found ballot campaigns took in more than $340 million. Roughly 36 percent of the donations – $123 million – came in during the eight months when the campaigns didn’t have to file reports. 
Ballot campaign spending in 2024 totaled $25.2 million on five questions, with another $19.2 million in what are known as in-kind contributions, which is categorized and valued as help, like staff time, that doesn’t come in the form of cash. For example, the Massachusetts Teachers Association had union staffers provide time and research in support of the ballot question ending the MCAS test as a high school graduation requirement.  
The union’s filings revealed it spent $15.7 million on in-kind contributions and $6.3 million in other expenses. The question passed with 59 percent of the vote, and the union ended up spending $8.25 per vote. 
In the September report covering the preceding eight months of spending, the MTA reported spending $2 million in “in-kind” donations, including $1.2 million in “staff time.”  
The September report from the business-backed “no” side showed $870,000 in donations during the same period, with $100,000 coming from Robert Rivers, the Eastern Bank CEO, and $25,000 from the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, among others. 
Chris Keohan, a veteran campaign consultant who has worked on multiple ballot campaigns, welcomed the proposed legislation. He worked on the successful 2024 campaigns to reject legalization of psychedelic substances and a question raising the minimum wage for tipped workers. The “no” campaigns were funded by groups that opposed drug legalization and by the restaurant industry. 
“Transparency’s always better,” Keohan said. “If our legislators have to file monthly, why don’t our ballot questions?”

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Trump administration job cuts in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will result in less scientific information that is needed to set and oversee Alaska seafood harvests, agency officials have warned fishery managers.
Since January, the Alaska regional office of NOAA Fisheries, also called the National Marine Fisheries Service, has lost 28 employees, about a quarter of its workforce, said Jon Kurland, the agency’s Alaska director.
“This, of course, reduces our capacity in a pretty dramatic fashion, including core fishery management functions such as regulatory analysis and development, fishery permitting and quota management, information technology, and operations to support sustainable fisheries,” Kurland told the North Pacific Fishery Management Council on Thursday.
NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, which has labs in Juneau’s Auke Bay and Kodiak, among other sites, has lost 51 employees since January, affecting 6% to 30% of its operations, said director Robert Foy, the center’s director. That was on top of some job losses and other “resource limitations” prior to January, Foy said.
“It certainly puts us in a situation where it is clear that we must cancel some of our work,” he told the council.
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council, meeting in Newport, Oregon, sets harvest levels and rules for commercial seafood harvests carried out in federal waters off Alaska. The council relies on scientific information from NOAA Fisheries and other government agencies.
NOAA has been one of the targets of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has been led by billionaire Elon Musk. The DOGE program has summarily fired thousands of employees in various government agencies, in accordance with goals articulated in a preelection report from the conservative Heritage Foundation called Project 2025.
NOAA’s science-focused operations are criticized in Project 2025. NOAA Fisheries, the National Weather Service and other NOAA divisions “form a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry and, as such, is harmful to future U.S. prosperity,” the Project 2025 report said.
The DOGE-led firings and cuts leave Alaska with notably reduced NOAA Fisheries services, Kurland and Foy told council members.
Among the services now compromised is the information technology system that tracks catches during harvest seasons — information used to manage quotas and allocations. “We really have less than a skeleton crew at this point in our IT shop, so it’s a pretty severe constraint,” Kurland said.
Also compromised is the Alaska Fisheries Science Center’s ability to analyze ages of fish, which spend varying amounts of years growing in the ocean. The ability to gather such demographic information, an important factor used by managers to set harvest levels that are sustainable into the future, is down 40%, Foy said.
A lot of the center’s salmon research is now on hold as well.
For example, work at the Little Port Walter Research Station, the oldest year-round research station in Alaska, is now canceled, Foy said. “We’re talking about the importance of understanding what’s happening with salmon in the marine environment and its interaction with ground fish stocks,” he said.

	Much of the work at Little Port Walter, located about 85 miles south of Juneau, has focused on Chinook salmon and the reasons for run declines, as well as the knowledge needed to carry out U.S.-Canada Pacific Salmon Treaty obligations.
As difficult as the losses have been, Kurland and Foy said they are bracing for even more cuts and trying to figure out how to narrow their focus on the top priorities.
Despite the challenges, Foy said, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center has managed to cobble together scheduled 2025 fish surveys in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, which produce the stock information needed to set annual harvest limits. Some of the employees doing that work have been pulled out of other operations to fill in for experienced researchers who have been lost, and data analysis from the fish surveys will be slower, he warned. 
“You can’t lose 51 people and not have that impact,” he said.
It was far from a given that the surveys would happen this year, Foy said. The science center team had to endure a lot of confusion leading up to now, he said.
“We’ve had staff sitting in airports on Saturdays, not knowing if the contract was done to start a survey on a Monday,” he said.
Pressure for bigger harvests
At the same time the Trump administration is making deep cuts to science programs, it also is pushing fishery managers to increase total seafood harvests.
President Donald Trump on April 17 issued an executive order called “Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness” that seeks to overturn “restrictive catch limits” and “unburden our commercial fishermen from costly and inefficient regulation.”
Federal fishing laws, including the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, require careful management to keep fisheries sustainable into the future. Unregulated fisheries have collapsed in the past, leading to regional economic disasters.
Part of the impetus for the executive order, a senior NOAA official told the council, is the long-term decrease in overall seafood landings.
Prior to 2020, about 9.5 billion pounds of seafood was harvested commercially each year, said Sam Rauch, NOAA Fisheries’ deputy assistant administrator for regulatory programs. Now that total is down to about 8.5 billion pounds, Rauch said.
He acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic played a role in the reduction, as did economics.
At their Newport meeting, council members raised concerns that the push for increased production might clash with the practices of responsible management, especially if there is less information to prevent overharvesting.

	Nicole Kimball, a council member and vice president of a trade organization representing seafood processors, cited a “disconnect” between the goal of increased seafood harvests and the “drastically lower resources” that managers normally rely upon to ensure harvest sustainability.
The typical approach is to be cautious when information is scarce, she noted. “if we have increased uncertainty — which we’ll have with fewer surveys or fewer people on the water — then we usually have more risk, and we account for that by lowering catch,” she said at the meeting.
In response, Rauch cited a need to cut government spending in general and NOAA spending in particular. That includes the agency’s fishery science work, he said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“We have to think about new and different ways to collect the data,” he said. “The executive order puts a fine point on developing new and innovative but also less expensive ways to collect the science.”
Even before this year, he said, NOAA was struggling with the increasing costs of its Alaska fish surveys and facing a need to economize.
The agency had already been working on a survey modernization program prior to the second Trump administration.
The Alaska portion of the program, announced last year, was intended to redesign fisheries surveys within five years to be more cost-effective and adaptive to changing environmental conditions.
Foy, in his testimony to the council, said job and budget cuts will now delay that modernization work.
“I can almost assuredly say that this is no longer a 5-year project but probably moving out and into the 6- or 7-year” range, he told the council.
Since Alaska accounts for about 60% of the volume of the nation’s commercial seafood catch, it is likely to have a big role in accomplishing the administration’s goals for increased production, council members noted.
Alaska’s total volume has been affected by a variety of forces in recent years. Those include two consecutive years of the Bering Sea snow crab fishery being canceled. That harvest had an allowable catch of 45 million pounds in the 2020-2021 season but wound up drastically reduced in the following year and shot down completely in the 2022-23 and 2023-2024 seasons because of a collapse in the stock.
Another factor is the shrinking size of harvested salmon.
Last year, Bristol Bay sockeye salmon were measured at the smallest size on record. The total 2024 Alaska salmon harvest of 101.2 million fish, one of the lowest totals in recent years, had a combined weight of about 450 million pounds.
Past years with similar sizes harvests by fish numbers yielded higher total weights. The 1987 Alaska salmon harvest of 96.6 million fish weighed a total 508.6 million pounds, while the 1988 Alaska salmon harvest of 100.6 million fish weighed in at 534.5 million pounds, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

DemasA citizen of the People’s Republic of China was arrested and charged with smuggling concealed biological material into the U.S. from a university in Wuhan, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan announced Monday.
The arrest of Chengxuan Han, who is currently pursuing a doctorate degree from the College of Life Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, is the third such arrest in the last few weeks related to smuggling of biological agents into the country involving the University of Michigan.
“The alleged smuggling of biological materials by this alien from a science and technology university in Wuhan, China — to be used at a University of Michigan laboratory — is part of an alarming pattern that threatens our security,” said U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Jerome Gorgon Jr. in a statement. “The American taxpayer should not be underwriting a PRC-based smuggling operation at one of our crucial public institutions.”
Han is alleged to have sent four packages with concealed biological material to the U.S. in 2024 and 2025. The packages were addressed to people associated with a laboratory at U of M.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office said in a news release that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers apprehended Han on Sunday after she arrived at Detroit Metro Airport on a J1 visa. Officers inspected Han and noted that Han made false statements about the packages and the material she had previously shipped to the U.S.
The content of an electronic device Han possessed was deleted three days prior to her arrival in the U.S. this week, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
Han was next interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, during which Han admitted to sending the packages and that they contained biological material related to round worms. She also admitted to making false statements to CBP officers during her initial inspection.
“The FBI has zero tolerance for those who violate federal law and remains unwavering in our mission to protect the American people,” Cheyvoryea Gibson, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office, said in a statement. “The alleged smuggling of biological materials by Chengxuan Han is a direct threat to public safety and national security, and it severely compromises the integrity of our nation’s research institutions.””
The Detroit News reported that Han was the third Chinese national with connections to U of M charged with a federal crime in the last two weeks. The FBI recently charged student Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, for attempting to smuggle biological pathogens into the country, which the agency said could be used as an agricultural terrorism weapon affecting food crops.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0009-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from Kansas Legislature video)TOPEKA — A leaked federal budget and the president’s budget forced Kansas advocates for people with disabilities to consider potential funding losses that could dramatically affect their services.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services budget for fiscal year 2026 was leaked to the press in April. It contained significant cuts to wide-ranging services, from mental health to developmental disabilities assistance to substance use programs, all of which would affect the vulnerable people the Disability Rights Center of Kansas serves, the organization’s leader said.
“I think everyone is taking it extremely seriously,” said Rocky Nichols, executive director of the Disability Rights Center of Kansas. “The disability community is pretty concerned about these types of proposals.”
Nichols shared a list outlining budget details, from the leaked budget and the president’s budget bill, that include “deep cuts” for the protection and advocacy system. Nichols said the proposed cuts would have a “grim impact.”
“Everything in the leaked budget is coming to fruition,” he said, pointing to the U.S. Department of Education budget information released recently, which confirmed some of the expected budget cuts.
With budgets for two disability programs unknown, Nichols estimated that federal budgets for programs serving people with disabilities would be cut by more than 64%.
“The best case scenario is, given what we know about the president’s budget, if the two programs that are outstanding are level funded at last year’s amount, it would be a 64% cut to our programs,” Nichols said. “If those programs are zeroed out, it would be an 87% cut.”
That would be devastating for Kansans with disabilities, he said.
The state agency charged with supporting Kansans with disabilities said it’s too early to determine how the Washington policies might affect state work.



Lost funding
In a breakdown of proposed cuts in a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services budget, Protection and Advocacy for Developmental Disabilities funding dropped from $45 million in fiscal year 2025 to zero for 2026, said Rocky Nichols, executive director of the Disability Rights Center of Kansas. 
The Disability Rights Center’s Protection program is part of the federal developmental disabilities network, as are the Kansas Council for Disability Rights and the Kansas University Center on Disabilities, he said.  Nichols said the leaked HHS budget shows the President eliminating all funding for the developmental disabilities network.
Nichols highlighted proposed budgets for other programs, shown here with the 2025 fiscal year budget amount followed by the proposed 2026 budget amount: 

Funding for the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness program, which serves people with significant mental illness, dropped from $40 million to $14.1 million.
The Client Assistance Program serves people accessing programs funded under the Rehabilitation Act, like Vocational Rehabilitation, $13 million to $0. 
The Protection and Advocacy for Voting Access, which helps people with disabilities register to vote and cast a ballot, $10 million to $0.
Protection and Advocacy for Individual Rights serves people who do not have a developmental disability or significant mental illness, which is the majority of Americans with disabilities, Nichols said, including people with mobility impairments, hearing and vision loss and mental illness that is not considered significant. $20.15 million to $0.
Protection and Advocacy for Traumatic Brain Injury and Protection and Advocacy for Assistive Technology, which serves people with disabilities who need access to assistive technology, were maintained at current funding in the proposed budget, $4.96 million and $5.27 million respectively.
Budget information for two programs is still unknown — Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social Security, which helps people who receive Social Security disability and who have barriers to employment, and Representative Payee, which is a program that conducts monitoring and review of representative payees who oversee Social Security benefits.




“At this time, it’s too early to comment on how these proposals may translate into actual policy changes or what the downstream effects on state programs might be,” said Cara Sloan-Ramos, Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services spokeswoman. “We are actively monitoring the situation and will be better positioned to assess the implications once more concrete details emerge.”
For Nichols, the proposed financial cuts would translate to significant service cuts.
“The developmental disability network is us, the Developmental Disability Council and the Kansas University Center on Disabilities,” Nichols said. “Collectively, the DD network serves 46,000 Kansans with intellectual and developmental disabilities, which includes diagnoses like autism, Down syndrome and Fragile X syndrome.”
Nichols said Congress set up the developmental disability network in the 1970s because people with disabilities were being taken advantage of and their rights were being trampled.
Proposed funding in the president’s bill would eliminate Nichols’ organization, the Disability Rights Center, where services include intensive disability rights advocacy services and the ability to respond to abuse, neglect and exploitation, Nichols said. The organization is designated as the protection and advocacy agency for Kansas, which gives it special powers to investigate abuse and neglect in the disability community.
Nichols shared a 2004 example of physical and sexual abuses in the Kaufman House in Newton. When other law enforcement couldn’t enter the home, the Disability Rights Center was able to do so, which was the catalyst for finding out about abuses and allowed them to help individuals with disabilities escape the situation, he said.
Malinda Barnett and Brian Ellefson, members of the disability community, both have spent their lives working to protect and advocate for people with disabilities. Barnett is executive director of the Statewide Independent Living Council of Kansas and Ellefson retired as director of an independent living program. He now volunteers for disability organizations.
The proposed cuts to disability programs are worrying, they said, but Barnett is even more worried about proposed Medicaid cuts included in the budget bill that passed the U.S. House.
More than 56,000 Kansans with disabilities are enrolled in Medicaid, according to KFF, which tracks enrollment rates nationwide.
“So many supports that are funded through Medicaid are essential to people with disabilities, and so that’s my biggest concern,” she said. “Medicaid waivered services were created to keep people out of institutions, and so if those are taken away, then there’s a strong possibility that people will have to go back to being institutionalized.”
While that is obviously not what anyone in the disability community wants, Barnett said it also doesn’t make sense financially.
“In the end, it does cost more money than Medicaid waiver services,” she said. “Nursing home services cost more money than home- and community-based services.”
Nichols agreed that proposed cuts would lead to more people being institutionalized, something the disability community has been consistently moving away from for decades.
“These programs that we’re talking about, developmental disabilities network on the I/DD side and then the protection and advocacy network across all disabilities, help people with disabilities navigate Medicaid, help them cut through red tape and navigate complex bureaucracies — that’s like going from bad to worse,” he said.
Medicaid cuts will kick people off of services and then they won’t have anywhere to turn to overcome the barriers they face, Nichols said.
Ellefson has spent his life helping people with disabilities become more independent with a goal of living on their own. Medicaid cuts would mean loss of support for individuals from waivers, and it would decrease quality of life for many people with disabilities, he said.
“The purpose of the waivers is so those individuals with disabilities that live independently can be more productive people in society, can find employment and can have more dignified quality of life,” he said. “With the cuts in Medicaid, they’re going to end up in institutions, which is what we’re trying to avoid.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A crowd of about 150 demonstrators marched on Monday from an Aurora park to the gates of Colorado’s only Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, in an “emergency protest” in solidarity with an anti-ICE protest movement in Los Angeles that has become the target of an escalating federal crackdown.
Outside the Aurora ICE Processing Center, operated by private prison firm GEO Group, marchers joined a weekly vigil for Jeanette Vizguerra, a prominent immigrant rights advocate and grandmother detained by ICE earlier this year, and other detainees held in the facility.
“This fight continues,” Vizguerra, speaking from inside the facility on a video call with her daughter Tania Baez, told Newsline in a brief interview. “This is solidarity — L.A. and the same here in Colorado, the people are very progressive. I’m very proud of my community, and I’m thankful for the support.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Vizguerra, who has lived in the U.S. since 1997, became a high-profile figure in the immigrant rights movement during the first Trump administration. She was detained in March after the Trump administration reinstated a 2013 removal order against her that had previously been stayed. Her lawyers have alleged in federal court that her arrest was in retaliation for protected speech.
Vizguerra later addressed the crowd, telling them she wished to share the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, which she accepted from within the ICE facility last week, with all of her fellow activists. She noted that June 17 will mark three months since she was taken into custody.
Monday’s demonstration came after protests erupted in Los Angeles over the weekend following a series of ICE raids targeting workers at a downtown clothing wholesaler and outside a Home Depot in the predominantly Latino suburb of Paramount. Federal agents in tactical gear shot tear gas and flash-bang grenades and arrested dozens of protesters they accused of obstructing the operations, including union leader David Huerta, who was charged by federal prosecutors Monday with a felony count of conspiracy to impede an officer.
Another anti-ICE demonstration is planned for the Colorado Capitol on Tuesday.
President Donald Trump has ordered thousands of California National Guard soldiers to be deployed to the city over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom and local leaders, the first such action by a U.S. president in 60 years. Thousands of demonstrators subsequently converged on a federal building in downtown L.A. to protest the Trump administration’s attempted crackdown, where police fired tear gas and less-lethal projectiles at protesters and journalists over several hours on Sunday, and similar scenes continued into Monday evening.
Trump officials, highlighting scattered acts of vandalism like the burning of several empty autonomous vehicles near the site of Sunday’s demonstration, have described the weekend’s events in sensational terms. Trump has baselessly described demonstrators as “paid insurrectionists” and signed an executive order calling the protests “a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”
On Monday, a detachment of roughly 700 U.S. Marines were also ordered by Trump to deploy to L.A. and tasked with “crowd control and establishment of security perimeters” around federal property, U.S. Northern Command announced.
U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, an Aurora Democrat and Army veteran, said in a statement that Trump’s move “threaten(s) the integrity and public trust of our military.”
“Introducing military personnel into domestic law enforcement situations is an escalation and can put both the military personnel and civilians on the ground at additional risk,” Crow said. “I urge President Trump to reverse course and allow state and local law enforcement officials to respond.”

Mass deportation program expanding
In his second term, Trump and his advisers have laid out plans for “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” vowing to deport all of the estimated 12 million people living in the country without permanent legal status.
After a relatively slow start, Trump’s mass deportation program has kicked into a higher gear in recent weeks. ICE agents have begun arresting individuals and families outside federal immigration courts, reversing a longstanding policy that avoided such arrests so as not to deter immigrants from going through lawful court proceedings. A series of high-profile raids at restaurants and other workplaces have occurred in cities across the country after Trump adviser Stephen Miller reportedly pressured the agency to broaden the scope of its enforcement operations.
“Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?” Miller asked ICE leaders on May 20, according to the Washington Examiner. In the same meeting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem reportedly told agency officials they “need to do more.”
The share of people in ICE detention with no criminal record had risen to nearly 25% as of June 1, a sharp uptick from 6% in January, according to the American Immigration Council.
In and around Denver, ICE has struggled to produce arrests of large numbers of people with extensive criminal histories. The agency launched a high-profile raid in February that it said would target more than 100 members of a Venezuelan gang, but admitted soon afterwards to Fox News that out of 30 arrests made that day, only one detainee was suspected of ties to the gang, Tren de Aragua.
Instead, ICE has resorted to arrests of otherwise law-abiding immigrants, including a family with a 1-year-old, attending hearings at federal immigration court in Denver; at least two raids on underground nightclubs in Colorado Springs and Denver that federal agents subsequently said produced no criminal charges; and the detention of Vizguerra, a well-known local figure who was taken into custody outside her workplace, Target.
Demonstrators outside the Aurora facility on Monday cheered the news of the release of Carla Medina, a Honduran immigrant and mother of two who was detained in October while attempting to deliver a DoorDash order to Buckley Space Force Base. Medina subsequently won her asylum case.
“Carla being free is a win. It represents everything that we’ve been chanting for the last couple months,” said Andrea Loya, director of Casa de Paz, a nonprofit that provides welcoming and support services for people released from the Aurora detention center. “We’re here standing up because what’s going on with our neighbors — here, in L.A., in New York, in Chicago, all across the U.S. — that is not fair to these people.”

(From Savannah River Site fact sheet, May 2022, U.S. Department of Energy)South Carolina’s federal nuclear site is part of a plan to replace the plutonium cores of bombs in the country’s nuclear arsenal. But now the federal government is taking a closer look at the environmental impacts of such a venture — or whether it’s even necessary.
A $25 billion factory planned for the Savannah River Nuclear Site in western South Carolina would mean new investment and lots of new jobs for the area — an estimated 1,000 new positions over the next several years.
But anti-nuclear and environmental groups sued in 2021 saying the U.S. Department of Energy, the federal agency that manages the country’s nuclear stockpile, didn’t follow national environmental law in developing its plans and failed to account for disposal of excess radioactive material.
In a settlement in January, the government agreed to redo the necessary study.
The public has until July 14 to weigh in on the scope and factors they think the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department’s nuclear arm, should consider in its review.
“A rushed program will likely increase the risks to the workers and frontline communities who bear still unaddressed burdens from the production of nuclear weapons during the Cold War,” Dylan Spaulding, senior scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote in a recent report.
The Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration did not respond to emails sent by the SC Daily Gazette.

Plutonium decays over centuries. The recycling of spheres of plutonium, called pits, used in nuclear weapons has become a priority over the past couple decades as the country’s nuclear stockpile has aged. In response, scientists at Savannah River, as well as those at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, have been charged with salvaging usable plutonium from old pits and recycling it into new ones.
Savannah River was expected to make 50 pits per year by 2030, though that timeline was considered ambitious to begin with. It  likely will be further delayed by the legal settlement, which halted some of the proposed construction work and equipment installation.
The 310-square-mile complex, known to locals as the “bomb plant,” produced weapons-grade plutonium and tritium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal from the 1950s through the end of the Cold War and nuclear arms race between the United States and Russia.
All radioactive production at the site that covers parts of Barnwell, Aiken, and Allendale counties ceased in 1992, when its mission shifted to cleanup and research.
Federal scientists have said they have no way of knowing how long the nuclear weapons pits will remain usable. But the Union of Concerned Scientists argues new pits aren’t necessary to maintain the existing U.S. nuclear fleet.
“The claim that we need new pits just to maintain a safe and reliable arsenal just doesn’t hold water,” Spaulding wrote. “The reality is NNSA has thousands of existing plutonium pits in reserve and should investigate options for re-use before one more pit is produced.”
Tom Clements, director of Savannah River Site Watch, is a longtime nuclear watchdog whose organization helped bring the federal lawsuit against the pit program. He also pointed to statements in the NNSA’s own study of pit aging, which says plutonium pits have reliable lifetimes of at least 100 years.
The average age of the country’s current pits is now around 42 years.
“While public rationales for the program often emphasize a need to replace aging pits, the national laboratories have offered no evidence that the nation’s existing pits are anywhere near the end of their service lives,” Spaulding wrote. “Moreover, the national laboratories can use existing capabilities to monitor any potential for aging effects without reviving pit production.”
Both Clements and the Union of Concerned Scientists are calling for a new independent assessment of pit lifetimes, an inventory of existing pits, as well as an assessment of all potential pit recycling and waste disposal sites, beyond those just considering Savannah River and Los Alamos.
Defense package includes $2.7B for SRS in 2024

South Carolina has long wrestled with tons of weapons-grade plutonium that have accumulated at Savannah River, suing in 2016 over the federal government’s inability to meet deadlines for its promised removal.
Much of the surplus plutonium from sites across the country was brought to South Carolina in 2002 and stored inside the reactor that once produced the radioactive metal.
It was supposed to be turned into fuel for commercial nuclear reactors — mixed-oxide fuel, or MOX — as part of a nonproliferation agreement with Russia in 2000. But with the plant to convert the plutonium years behind schedule and billions over budget, the Obama administration tried repeatedly to scrap it. However, South Carolina’s delegation balked, and Attorney General Alan Wilson sued, keeping the project going.
The fatal blow came from the Trump administration, which continued with his predecessor’s plans, and another effort by South Carolina officials to revive the project failed. The project was officially terminated in 2018.
That left 11.5 metric tons of plutonium underground at SRS, enough to build the bomb dropped on Nagasaki nearly 2,000 times over, The Post and Courier reported.
A $600 million settlement with the state in fall 2020 gave the U.S. Department of Energy an additional 15 years, until 2037, to get rid of all the plutonium it shipped to SRS. Even if doesn’t, South Carolina can’t sue again until 2042, as per the settlement’s terms.
The proposed pit production factory is meant to be developed at the site of that failed fuels plant.
The state already has invested heavily to prepare for the future of both the Savannah River Site and its associated national laboratory.
Last year, the Legislature allocated $60 million in the budget to fund faculty, student scholarships, lab upgrades and a control room simulator at the University of South Carolina, Clemson University and South Carolina State University, as well as a workforce center at USC’s four-year campus in Aiken.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Waste-tanks-SRS.png,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-10 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Health centers to withdraw CT Medicaid rate petition after budget earmark,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/10/ct-medicaid-reimbursement-rates-budget-petition/,Community health centers will withdraw a petition to the state following an earmark in the CT budget to increase Medicaid reimbursement rates.,"The Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, or CHCACT, will withdraw a petition sent to the state in March demanding the administration admit it was in violation of federal law governing reimbursements for care provided to low-income patients on Medicaid.
The decision to stand down follows a deal between CHCACT and the state included in the 2026-27 biennial budget passed by legislators last week. The budget earmarks a total of $26.4 million over three years to increase how much the state pays the health centers for care provided to patients with Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut. 
“This was a true negotiation,” Deb Polun, chief strategy officer at CHCACT, said. “It’s about getting health centers to a place where they’re more financially sustainable and able to serve all people. And having Medicaid rates go up will benefit all health center patients and really the entire community.”
Federally qualified community health centers provide health care services to patients who may not otherwise have access to them, and they don’t turn away anyone who cannot pay. In 2023, nearly 70% of Connecticut’s FQHC patients had incomes at or below the federal poverty level, according to data presented in the petition. 
Overall, the budget allocates $15 million in fiscal year 2026 and $45 million in FY 2027 to boost Medicaid reimbursement rates for providers. Out of that pot of money, the health centers will receive $5 million in FY 2026 and an additional $7 million in FY 2027, a spokesperson with the state’s Office of Policy and Management confirmed. The legislation also secures an additional $14 million for the health centers in FY 2028. 
If the rate at which the federal government matches state spending on Medicaid doesn’t change, the agreement would bring in an additional $15 million, $36 million and $80 million in combined state and federal Medicaid dollars to health centers over the next three fiscal years, respectively, Polun said.
“We were very pleased with that compromise,” she added.
Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves stated in emailed comments that the state is “delighted” to have reached an agreement with the health centers.
“The FQHC providers are essential partners in delivering high quality health care to all residents. We look forward to continuing to build our partnership, with the shared goals of addressing the health care needs of Connecticut’s residents and increasing access to preventative care throughout the state,” Barton Reeves wrote.
Polun said Barton Reeves “really went to the mat for the health centers” and confirmed that CHCACT intends to officially withdraw its petition once the governor signs the bill and DSS works out certain implementation details. 
In March, CHCACT sent what’s known as a “declaratory ruling request” to DSS asserting that the agency had not been complying with laws that require periodic reviews of, and increases to, Medicaid rates based on changes to services provided by health centers.
An analysis included in the filing found Connecticut’s average FQHC Medicaid rate to be “at the bottom of the spectrum” in New England, at $163.37 per visit, compared to $297 in New Hampshire, $241.96 in Massachusetts and $196.79 in Vermont. 
As a result of DSS’s actions, community health centers have had to freeze hiring and reduce or eliminate important services, Joanne Borduas, CEO of Community Health and Wellness Center in Torrington, said at the time of the filing.
“Every FQHC’s Medicaid rates must be periodically adjusted to account for all increases (or decreases) to the scope of the medical, dental, and behavioral-health services that the FQHC provides to Medicaid patients,” the filing states. “DSS has done virtually everything in its power not to honor its obligation under the Medicaid laws to pay FQHCs reimbursement rates that reflect cost increases attributable to changes in their scope of services.”
In general, community health centers get paid a fixed rate by Medicaid per visit for medical, dental and behavioral health services. That fee can vary based on a facility’s size, volume of patients and the extent of services provided. Federal law requires that those rates get periodically adjusted to account for increases or decreases in the scope of services.
The petition asserted that DSS failed to regularly review and adjust rates, and instead based its decisions on whether to grant requests for increases on “irrelevant substantive factors” — for example, that the state budget doesn’t allow for a rate increase or that the FQHC isn’t in need of one.
The budget agreement reached last week also clarifies the process by which the health centers can apply for Medicaid reimbursement rate increases if the “type, intensity, duration or amount of services” provided to patients changes.
The state is still figuring out how the remainder of the funds to boost Medicaid reimbursement rates, which haven’t been broadly adjusted since 2007, will get divided up amongst other provider types, a spokesperson with the Department of Social Services said. 
Not all providers are as satisfied with the outcome of the legislative session. The state’s hospitals won’t see any of the funding allocated for Medicaid increases in the budget, though they will get a 2% boost in reimbursement rates as part of the hospital provider tax settlement passed in 2019, the DSS spokesperson said.
A spokesperson with the Connecticut Hospital Association said that while the organization welcomes the legislature’s work to begin addressing Medicaid underfunding, there is still a long way to go.
“The legislative action taken this session does not address the $1.4 billion Medicaid funding shortfall experienced by hospitals and in the second year of the biennium hospitals will lose the annual, modest, hospital-tax financed rate increases agreed to under the settlement agreement. This will only worsen the financial struggles that hospitals in the state are experiencing today,” a CHA spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2024_0208_SR_55Farmington_046_2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Organizations from around the country signed a letter on Monday urging U.S. senators not to include a controversial proposal to sell thousands of acres of federal land in Congress’ budget bill.
The letter comes in the wake of reports that Utah Sen. Mike Lee is considering reviving an amendment to the bill originally proposed by Republican U.S. Reps. Mark Amodei of Nevada and Celeste Maloy of Utah that would dispose of nearly 11,500 acres of Bureau of Land Management land in southwestern Utah, and about 450,000 acres in Nevada.
Lee, when asked by a Politico reporter last week if he intended to reintroduce the disposal, responded, “I gotta go vote, but yes.”
Lee’s office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday, and it’s unclear whether Utah’s senior GOP senator is considering bringing back an exact copy of the amendment, or something different.
Amodei outrages NV congressional colleagues with ‘dead of night’ federal land sales amendment

But more than 100 organizations and nonprofits around the country are sounding the alarm, telling Senate leaders to “heed how dramatically unpopular this idea is and reject any misguided attempt to get public lands sales back in this bill.”
“Decisions about the future of public lands should remain in public hands. Leaders in the House and Senate, extractive industry, and private developers are using the reconciliation process to sell off federal lands to pay for billionaire tax cuts. But such moves are deeply unpopular. Polling has repeatedly shown that the public — especially westerners — strongly believes in keeping public lands in public hands and, across partisan lines, rejects any efforts that would lead to the sale of these shared and cherished lands,” reads the letter, signed by Utah groups like the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, Conserve Southwest Utah, Save Our Canyons, Great Basin Water Network and Back Country Horsemen of Utah.
The letter is addressed to Lee, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich, the committee’s ranking member, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat.
The House amendment backed by Amodei and Maloy was dropped from the budget bill after it received pushback from all sides of the aisle. That includes Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross and rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip the proposal from the bill.
“The public had no opportunity to participate in the process of identifying these parcels, let alone time to understand the long-term effect of selling off these public lands,” the letter reads.

(Brian Maffly/University of Utah)As Utah prepares for an overdue, big earthquake, University of Utah seismologists found that current seismic hazard models may be underestimating the intensity of shaking the Salt Lake Valley could experience in future earthquakes. 
That’s because sediments in some areas under the valley are thicker than expected, researchers said in a news release — and thicker sediments can lead to stronger shaking during an earthquake.

“In a basin, seismic shaking is amplified. It’s very important to understand the thickness and rigidity of sediment to better assess potential shaking. The sediment is thicker than previously thought — especially in the heavily populated area south of Salt Lake City,” study leader Fan-Chi Lin, an associate professor of geology and geophysics at the U. said in the release. 
The state is still rebuilding infrastructure shaken up by the 5.7 magnitude Magna earthquake that happened in 2020. However, often referred to as “the big one,” a future earthquake of 6.75 or greater magnitude is highly probable at the Wasatch Front in the next 50 years, according to Envision Utah.

With about 80% of the state’s population living in the area, experts estimate that could be an exceptionally devastating event. 
“Our findings reinforce the idea that a hazard exists in the valley and that shaking could be stronger than expected. Many houses in Salt Lake are unreinforced masonry and could be vulnerable in a big quake,” Lin said. “Buildings should be reinforced, and people should be prepared.”
After installing an extensive network of seismic data sensors along the valley after the spring of 2020 and analyzing seismic waves from distant earthquakes, Lin’s team created a revised and refined three-dimensional seismic velocity model to map the Wasatch Front’s geologic structure and identify earthquake hazard sites.
That model allowed the researchers to find thicker sediment deposits than previously estimated, and can provide answers when preparing for “the big one.”
“If we know the subsurface structure very well, then we can predict how strong the ground motion will be when the big earthquake happens,” Lin said. “And that will allow us to collaborate with the engineers to determine which buildings are potentially hazardous when the big earthquake hits.”

Her son Edward Reeves, an entertainer, a rapper whose stage name was “Bambino Gold” based out of Atlanta, was shot and killed with a companion in 2017. His body was found in Macon County.
Three years later, her son Christopher Noel Brown, was shot in June 2020. He died three months later.
“They said he didn’t die of the gunshot wound, he had other health issues, issues with his heart and his kidney,” she said. “But I am sure having two bullet holes in him didn’t help at all.”
She attempted to claim compensation for Edward’s death under a state program allowing crime victims and their families to apply for help. But the process, she said, was difficult.
“The ABI (Alabama State Bureau of Investigation) agent, he put on the paperwork that my son was in the process of committing a crime when he died,” Harris said. “He didn’t have any proof of that at all. And so, since he put that on the paperwork, they denied my son’s case. And they also said that we did not cooperate with them, which is crazy, I did everything that they asked us to do.”
A spokesperson for the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, responsible for overseeing the Alabama State Bureau of Investigation, said its purpose is to be an independent fact-finding agency.
“When an individual is involved with a claim that is associated with the Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission (ACVCC), law enforcement officers are required to provide information concerning the case and list that information on the ACVCC application,” the agency said in its statement. “Certain eligibility requirements must be met as determined by the Commission such as the claimant or victim must fully cooperate with law enforcement and the victim must not have contributed to the offense.”
Harris was one of more than two dozen people that included activists and caregivers, along with other victims of violent crime who attended the “Right to Heal: Access to Victim Compensation” hosted by the Alliance for Safety and Justice, a criminal justice reform organization based in Oakland, California, the first week of April.
The event was organized by Aswad Thomas, vice president of Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice, the flagship project of the Alliance for Safety and Justice, who is a victim of gun violence himself. Thomas was shot by two attempted robbers while leaving a convenience store in Hartford, Connecticut in 2009.
“I think they fired eight or nine times, and I was shot twice in my back close to my spinal cord,” Thomas said.
The physician told Thomas that the bullets were so close to his spinal cord that it wasn’t clear whether he would walk again.
“That was when it hit me that I was a victim of gun violence,” Thomas said. “My first, immediate thought, was ‘Will I ever play basketball again?’ My second thought — would I ever walk again?”
Thomas did manage to walk again, but the injuries ended any hope of a professional basketball career.
“Like so many victims across the country, I never received any support or services after that incident, and law enforcement, who came to visit me several times during my recovery process to see how I was doing, never mentioned anything about victim services or where I could go to get help,” he said.
Both Thomas and Harris are but two examples of people who were not able to receive assistance pertaining to instances of violent crime.
Several who attended the April event praised victim assistance organizations for offering aid. But organizers of the event highlighted how many victims do not receive any support as they endured their painful experiences.
Some, like Thomas, were unaware that support was available. But for others, such as Harris, highlight how the rules create barriers for people seeking assistance.
Crime victims compensation
Victims of violent crimes are entitled to compensation from money offered by the Office for Victims of Crime, a department within the U.S. Department of Justice.
That agency manages the Crime Victims Fund that was established by the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, which is funded from fines and penalties from convictions in federal cases and not tax dollars, according to the agency’s website.
That money is then allocated to states, as well as federal and tribal victim assistance programs, in the form of grants.
Typically, that money is distributed to victims through the state’s crime victim’s compensation program which can help defray costs such as medical care, counseling and lost wages, as well as funeral expenses for those who died because of an incident involving violent crime.
States can operate their own programs to assist crime victims and outline how to fund such assistance they make available to crime victims.
In Alabama, the Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission reviews applications submitted by victims and their families seeking financial assistance for funeral expenses, medical bills, as well as counseling services and wage compensation.
But the commission, funded for decades by fines and fees from those convicted of crimes, struggled for years to collect the revenues it needed for crime victims.

“People who are assessed fines and fees generally don’t pay them,” said Leah Nelson, formerly the research director at Alabama Appleseed who studies fines and fees in Alabama. “So there isn’t a lot of money to go around.”
The Alabama Legislature in 2023 made a direct appropriation to the commission for the first time in history. It also received a second tranche of money totaling $1 million from the Governor’s supplemental appropriation to help with paying claims to victims.
Organizers of the Right to Heal event said few victims realize they have access to support. If they do reach out, it is difficult for them to obtain compensation because of the layers of rules and regulations pertaining to eligibility and the process.
According to a report published in 2022 by the Alliance for Safety and Justice, only 4% of victims stemming from violent crime received any compensation to help with recovering from the incident.  Of those who did not receive any aid, almost half would have wanted some type of assistance.
Only 8% of victims of violent crimes surveyed as part of the report indicated that the criminal justice system provided sufficient support related to the violent crime incident.
About 29% reported they were unaware that support was available. Another 28% stated that the criminal justice system was “very unhelpful” while another 15% reported the system was “somewhat unhelpful.”
The report also indicates the criminal justice system offered little financial support because 87% of victims surveyed did not receive any financial assistance or economic support, while another 74% did not obtain any counseling or mental health assistance related to the violent crime incident.
Much of the support that victims receive comes from sources that are not part of the criminal justice system. More than half, 52%, received help from family or friends. Another 28% got assistance from medical providers while 16% received assistance from a community-based program.
Without adequate funding and having to navigate multiple obstacles, victims and their loved ones have little hope of receiving the resources they need to cope with the trauma of what they experienced.
“It would have been great to be educated about the psychological effects that I would be experiencing, and how to deal and cope with the PTSD, how to deal with the panic and anxiety attacks,” Thomas said. “Learn to deal with the anger and the deep stage of depression I was in.”
Thomas also wanted pain management education. He said he was discharged from the hospital with a set of pain medications but received little training on how they worked. He would have sought financial support to be placed in a different neighborhood instead of returning to the area where he was shot, staying in the living room in his mother’s house.

– Aswad Thomas, vice president, Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice


Thomas would have also wanted the counselor or therapist to visit him at his mother’s house.
“My car was impounded at the time of the shooting,” Thomas said. “If a counselor or therapist was able to actually come to my home to provide those services, that would have helped.”

A possible compensation model

Thomas and the Alliance for Safety and Justice, recognizing that victims are not receiving the support they need, established a model to allow more victims to receive compensation.
The authors of the report suggested states remove the restrictions for victims who do not report the crime to law enforcement.

“But less than half — only 40% — of violent crimes are reported to the police at all. The victim may be too traumatized to go through the reporting process, may fear being revictimized, or may have reasons to distrust the justice system,” the report states.
They also suggest expanding the eligibility for receiving aid to those on probation and parole, or those with a criminal record, as well as ending the eligibility exclusions to receive funding, as in the case of Harris and her son.
“When a violent crime occurs, the nature of the activities the victim may or may not have been involved in at the time of the incident should not bear on compensation decisions,” the report states.
The Texas Legislature passed legislation in 2021 that allows a crime victim to claim compensation even if they are not ready to cooperate with law enforcement. Another bill that passed in Ohio, also in 2021, removed some eligibility restrictions for victims.
Other states, including Florida, Pennsylvania, California and Michigan, have extended the deadline for people to submit a claim with their respective crime victim’s compensation commissions.
In California, the law more than doubled the limit from three years to seven years, according to the report.
The Alabama Crime Victims Compensation has worked to make changes, such as shortening the application and making it available for victims and their families to complete online.
They also continue to solicit funding to pay for operating expenses. However, commissioners are seeking more changes. In keeping with the actions of the other states, the commission seeks to extend the filing deadline for Alabama.
“How I was able to fill out the forms and get that done within the first year I just don’t know,” said Darlene Hutchinson, one of the commissioners of the Alabama Crime Victims Compensation Commission who was a victim of violent crime herself.
She said that the commission encountered many cases in which the application was filed after the one-year deadline for victims to file for claims, and that they are urging lawmakers to change that requirement.
“I think that is going to be huge for victims,” she said. “A couple of my close victim-advocate friends who have been doing this work for 20-plus years, when I sent them a text message and told them that we are going to pursue this, they were just so excited.”
HB 355, sponsored by Rep. Russell Bedsole, R-Alabaster, would have increased the deadline for ACVCC claims from one to two years after the original crime.
“I think this is one that all members, regardless of what side of the political aisle you are on, we can all agree this is something that we want to do to support the victims in our state,” Bedsole said.
The bill passed the House but did not come to a vote in the Senate before the end of the 2025 legislative session.
“We were disappointed this bill did not get on the Senate calendar/agenda the final days of the session,” Hutchinson said after the session ended.

(Provided)As torrential rains inundated Kentucky in April, Union County Judge-Executive Adam O’Nan needed labor to fill and distribute sandbags to protect homes and businesses from flooding.
After a phone call, local students from the Earle C. Clements Job Corps Center stepped up to the task.
“They loaded those bags for them and were a tremendous help,” O’Nan said.
  Union County, Kentucky, Judge-Executive Adam O’Nan
Now the hundreds of students and employees at the center in Union County could be scattering to uncertain futures after the Trump administration on May 29 announced that it would “pause” Job Corps operations across the country.
O’Nan, a Republican, said that would be a loss for his county.
“It really is difficult to measure the value because we’re just so used to them being around, and not that we take them for granted, but they’re just part of us,” O’Nan said. “If, in fact, this is the end of Job Corps, that’s just going to be a big void for us.”
The abrupt halt would be an even bigger loss for the center’s mostly low-income students who are feeling panic, anger and desperation about their futures, said Jonathan Brown, the finance and administration director for the Clements center.
“Either they have nowhere to go — they’re homeless or house insecure, they don’t have safe places to go — or they’re just not done with their trade,” Brown said. “I couldn’t imagine going to college for two years, halfway done, and then my school closes and loses its accreditation and none of my classes count.”
A federal judge Wednesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from stopping work at Job Corps centers or terminating contracts until a further ruling in the lawsuit brought by a trade group representing Job Corps center contractors.
Brown said the staff in Morganfield had been notified that its contracts to run the center, including contracts for employees, were being cancelled with a deadline of June 30 to have students returned to their home states. Guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor states the department will cover the cost to send students back to their home states by the end of the month and connect them with other job training and educational opportunities.
The Clements enter is one of dozens across the country — including two others in Kentucky in Floyd and Muhlenberg counties —  funded by the federal government that have offered young people free training in a wide variety of career paths including culinary arts, welding, nursing, electrical work, diesel mechanics and more.
There are three Job Corps centers in Missouri, in Excelsior Springs, Puxico and St. Louis. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat from Kansas City, joined 198 other members of Congress in a letter urging the Department of Labor to reverse its decision to close the Job Corps centers.
“As companies continue to onshore and invest in the men and women of our country, a steady stream of skilled laborers will be required to meet the growing workforce demand,” the letter stated. “The Job Corps program is uniquely positioned to fill that role and provide these hardworking young Americans with the vocational and technical job training that will set them and our country up for success.”
Brown said the Clements center is the second largest in the country in terms of students served. He said the center had been contracted to serve more than 1,000 students, bringing in usually 30-40 new students each week. He said about 275 employees serve those students.
Created 61 years ago as a part of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, Job Corps enrolls people between the ages of 16 and  24 who are dealing with challenges such as poverty, homelessness, a disability or falling behind on reading and writing skills.
In announcing the “pause,” the Trump administration cited data from 2023 that it argues shows cost overruns and low graduation rates.
But Brown, the Job Corps administrator in Union County, argues the April report from the Trump administration is largely misleading, cherry-picking data from 2023 when centers were still rebounding from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Brown also thinks the “pause” of operations is essentially a closure.
 ‘A failed experiment’

Brown said the headwinds for his center began to pick up months ago with various positions and departments being cut, but he became particularly troubled with the center’s situation when enrollment of new students was halted in March.
He said the Department of Labor stopped doing background checks for new students, essentially stopping the center from bringing in new enrollees.
Then in April, the department issued a report looking at graduation rates and the cost to graduate students from each center, stating that overall the average cost for each student was a little over $80,000 and the average graduation rate  was 38.6%.

In early May, the Trump administration sent a budget request to Congress that eliminated funding for the Job Corps, calling it “a failed experiment to help America’s youth.” In testimony before Congress on May 15, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told lawmakers the president’s budget request signaled a need to “refocus” on “where those dollars are going to have the outcome for the workforce.”
On May 29, Chavez-DeRemer announced the “pause” of Job Corps center operations, citing the report from April as evidence of the ineffectiveness of the Job Corps programs.
“Job Corps was created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education, training, and community,” Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement provided in a press release. “However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve. We remain committed to ensuring all participants are supported through this transition and connected with the resources they need to succeed as we evaluate the program’s possibilities.”
In Union County, Brown acknowledges there are “inefficiencies” within Job Corps and that some centers perform better than others. But given the United States is the “richest country in the history of the world,” he questioned why the federal government couldn’t provide “this small amount to give people that second chance.”
An information sheet provided to the Lantern from the director of the Earle C. Clements center asserts the average graduation rate for Job Corps centers is higher than the average graduation rate for two-year community and technical colleges. The information sheet also asserts the average cost per student is lower, and comparable to community and technical colleges, when Job Corps enrollees who don’t ultimately graduate are taken into account.
The April report released by the Trump administration says the Earle C. Clements center has a graduation rate of 47% and a cost per enrollee of $67,713 in 2023, both figures better than the national average in the report.
Job Corps’ operations cost roughly $1.53 billion in fiscal year 2024, making up a small fraction of the $6.75 trillion of federal government spending that fiscal year.
“I wish it was a more nuanced look at how to make the program better to meet that national need to provide skilled labor while also serving disadvantaged youth,” said Brown.
A Department of Labor spokesperson did not respond to several emails requesting comment about criticisms of its April report.
 Finding meaning in helping students

Laura Moore, the manager of Amanda’s Floral and Gift Shop in Sturgis, said the loss of Job Corps in Union County  “is really going to impact our whole community.”
Her relatively new business hosted two paid internships with Job Corps students, one of whom worked on revamping the store’s website.
“It kind of gives those kids a chance to get out into the real world without some of the struggles that they have at home,” Moore said. “Getting away from where they are and coming to the Job Corps Center and having a chance at life.”
Job Corps students also put together a “wonderful meal,” she said, for a local gathering called “Derby Days” celebrating the running of the Kentucky Derby.
“All the Derby favorites: They made a virgin mint julep, all the cucumber sandwiches that you could eat,” Moore said. “They put their heart and soul into all of that, and that was a big deal downtown here in Sturgis.”
Brown, the finance and administration director for the local center, said the backgrounds of students can vary depending on what circumstances qualify them to enroll. It’s not uncommon for students to show up with only a garbage bag of “old, dirty clothes.”
Finding meaning in helping those students is what has kept Brown, a Union County native, working at the center for 11 years, starting as a career counselor for students. He’s loved the work since “day one.”
“My whole job was about the student, whatever they needed to get through the program, get their credentials, get their high school diploma, get a good job,” Brown said. “It’s stressful and it’s hard, but it’s meaningful. And you can see it every single day — the meaning.”
He believes Job Corps is unique from other educational opportunities because it provides young people a safe place, free of charge, to sleep, have regular meals and work on a career away from the challenges they left behind. To make sure these young people, he said, don’t fall through the cracks.
“I don’t know what a lot of this population will do. I don’t know what options they really have,” Brown said.

(Elaine Cromie / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
 
Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, an 18-year-old undocumented immigrant, had planned to return to Colombia with his mother after he graduated from Western International High School.
With roughly one semester left in school, Maykol began making arrangements to leave the U.S.
But his plans and his education were upended last month when he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Instead of finishing out his junior year this week, the teen is in custody of the federal government and faces an “imminent” risk of deportation, according to his attorney.
Immigration advocates are now calling on Michigan’s governor, several Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation, and Detroit school district leaders to fight for Maykol’s release so he can complete his schooling in the U.S.
“At this time of the year, students should be focused on graduation and summer,” said Ruby Robinson, senior managing attorney with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, who is representing Maykol. “And here we have a student on precious time who is being deported. He should be able to finish his studies.”
Maykol is only 3.5 credits away from graduating, Robinson said, and would likely be able to finish school around the end of the calendar year.
His attorney said he is asking to be released and granted a stay of deportation to see his studies through before returning to Colombia.
Maykol was arrested on May 20 after he attempted to join a school field trip to Lake Erie Metropark, about 25 miles from Detroit. While driving with three other students in the car, Maykol was pulled over for tailgating another vehicle, said Robinson.
The teen was asked to provide his driver’s license but only had a City of Detroit identification card. Michigan does not currently issue driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.
The local police officers who pulled Maykol over could not speak Spanish and had trouble communicating with him, Robinson said, so they called Customs and Border Protection.
“An important aspect of this story is that local police, instead of relying on internal translation services, were relying on Border Patrol agents to interpret for them,” said Robinson.
The practice of calling on Border Protection for traffic stops with people who can’t speak English could be interpreted as racial profiling, the attorney said.
Randy Krause, chief of the Rockwood Police Department, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Maykol, who came to the U.S. at 16, received a final deportation order in 2024. After that, Maykol was working with ICE and the Colombian Consulate to obtain the travel documents he needed to depart the country, according to his attorney.
“We were in compliance with their order,” said Robinson, adding the documents are required in order to board an airplane out of the country. “It takes time for those documents to be generated.”
He was still in the process of arranging to return to Colombia with his mother when he was arrested. It’s unclear if he would have been able to graduate before leaving.
On Monday afternoon, Robinson and Maykol’s family didn’t know where he was. They believed he was being moved from the Chippewa County Correctional Facility to another location early Monday morning, the attorney said.
“We expect when he does reach where he will spend the night tonight, we will be able to find him, or he will be able to make a phone call to us or his mom,” said Robinson.
The attorney said because of the high number of people detained by ICE, the agency places them wherever bed space is available.
“We’re seeing people detained in far parts of Michigan,” he said. “We’re also seeing people being sent to Ohio and other places as well.”
 Advocates want Michigan leaders to speak out

By Monday afternoon, nearly 900 people had signed a petition asking Michigan officials to condemn Maykol’s arrest, urge for him to be released to complete his high school education, and “to put preventative policies in place to better support immigrant students and families.”
Three advocacy groups — 482Forward, MI Students Dream, and the People’s Assembly — created the petition.
Lindsey Matson, the deputy director of 482Forward, said the advocacy effort is aimed at raising awareness of the issue and the petition, if it gains traction, will put pressure on those who have the power to intervene.
“Even a statement from the school board will be helpful,” Matson added.
The petition calls for action from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, U.S. Sens. Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin, U.S. House Reps. Shri Thanedar and Rashida Tlaib, and the Detroit Public Schools Community District.
Thanedar, in a Monday evening post on X, formerly Twitter, responded to the detention, saying: “ICE should not be detaining high schoolers! Maykol Bogoya-Duarte just needs 3 credits to graduate, but was put in detention by ICE. He should be released immediately and allowed to get his diploma.”
Nikolai Vitti, superintendent of the district, told Chalkbeat last week that the school system’s police department had advocated on the student’s behalf.
But the district did not notify students and families of the arrest because Maykol was not “under the protection and responsibility” of the school system when ICE detained him, said Vitti.
Robinson said notification about the incident or future instances like it would provide reassurances to families about how the district responds in these situations.
“I think people are looking for something like that from the school district,” said Robinson.
In addition to advocating for Maykol’s release to allow the teen to finish school, the attorney said the district should ensure its policies and practices support the needs of community members with immigration challenges.
That includes making sure students and staff understand their rights in interactions with law enforcement, he added.
In New York, the detention of a student has gained widespread attention and calls from advocates and political leaders for his release. (A second teen has since been detained.) Similarly, the detention of a teenager in Massachusetts prompted rallies.
Less attention has been paid to Maykol’s plight in comparison.
Matson said his case isn’t less important than what has happened in the other states.
“I feel like Democrats in Michigan have not really stood up for our immigrant population here,” she said.
The advocacy groups calling for Maykol’s release are asking community members to attend the Detroit Public Schools Community District board meeting at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at Martin Luther King Jr. High School to urge school leaders to make public statements.
Immigration advocates are also encouraging community members to call the offices of state and national lawmakers, as well as ICE.

(Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)With his goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants a year appearing elusive, President Donald Trump, who pledged to rid America of the “worst of the worst,” is revising his game plan in favor of sweeping, untargeted apprehension efforts that are likely to ensnare so-called ‘low-hanging fruit’ – immigrants with no criminal background who find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Over the weekend, the presence of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents staged outside a Home Depot store in Los Angeles ignited protests from individuals angered at the indiscriminate effort to apprehend immigrants who were there seeking work. 
In response, Trump nationalized 2,000 California National Guard troops, a move condemned by Gov. Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass. On Monday, the military said 700 marines would be added to the force, the New York Times reported. 
“They’re essentially fishing with a net and not giving a shit about what they catch,” New York immigration attorney Michael Cataliotti said during a phone interview about the Trump administration’s reported efforts to boost arrests to 3,000 a day. “They are quite literally dredging. And whatever you get, you get, and maybe you throw out a couple things that shouldn’t have been caught. But they’re not even really doing that so much.”
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports it apprehended 66,463 immigrants, an average of 664 a day, in Trump’s first 100 days in office. The effort has been marred by a lack of detention beds. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill adds almost $1 trillion toward the effort, reports the Cato Institute.
Some experts suggest Trump is exacting revenge on California, a blue state, in the same manner he’s cut funding to Harvard for failing to cleanse its curriculum and curb First Amendment expression to his satisfaction; extorted legal services from law firms that represent interests to which he’s opposed; and persuaded TV networks in his disfavor to pay multi-million dollar settlements or face regulatory consequences.  
Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond when asked whether he approves of Trump’s activation of the National Guard in California, or the administration’s deportation tactics in Nevada, such as conducting warrantless arrests and ambushing individuals attending immigration hearings. 
In the past, Lombardo has waffled when asked whether he would deploy Nevada’s National Guard to assist with deportations. 
On Monday, Lombardo announced his veto of legislation that would have limited the access of immigration officials to school grounds and records without a court order or warrant. The measure was intended to give students peace of mind in the classroom that their personal information would not be used to separate family members. 
Leo Murietta, executive director of Make the Road Action Nevada, an immigration advocacy organization, said in a statement Lombardo is “more committed to appeasing the far-right and echoing Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda than he is to protecting children in Nevada’s schools.”
Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill, who has repeatedly said it’s not his job to assist with deportations, has since relented. Last week, McMahill confirmed the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Dept. intends to rejoin ICE’s controversial 287(g) program, in which police departments cooperate by holding undocumented immigrants for 48 hours following their scheduled release to allow federal agents to take custody. 
Metro suspended the program in 2019 after a U.S. District Court ruled that ICE detainers violate the Fourth Amendment by allowing warrantless arrests absent probable cause. 
McMahill did not respond to inquiries from the Current about the reason behind the change of policy, but in an interview with KLAS-TV, said he doesn’t want immigrant offenders “in my community anymore.  We had child pornographers being released; folks that had shot people being released.” 
“The sheriff said some fairly ugly things – smearing immigrants with incredibly heinous crimes that are fortunately relatively rare,” said Michael Kagan, director of UNLV’s Immigration Clinic. “I think that there are a lot of reasons not to take that seriously.”
Most of the defendants caught up in the 287(g) program are likely to be low-level offenders, for crimes such as driving under the influence, Kagan suggests, adding the sheriff could limit cooperation with ICE to exclude low-level offenders.  
Meanwhile, deporting serious offenders renders ICE as the “getaway driver” for high-level offenders who will escape accountability for their offenses, Kagan says.
Others contend McMahill’s about-face is a reaction to Trump’s repeated threats to cut federal funding for jurisdictions that fail to comply with deportation efforts. 
“Maybe everyone is concerned about losing federal dollars,” said Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom. 
A report from the Guinn Center for Policy Priorities says Nevada relied on federal funding for about 28% of its $53.4 billion budget in the last biennium, most of it Medicaid matching funds.
In late April, Trump signed an executive order threatening cuts to federal funding for local jurisdictions that fail to assist with immigration enforcement. Days earlier, a federal judge in San Francisco issued an injunction prohibiting Trump from withholding funds that are unrelated to so-called “sanctuary” policies, which have no legal definition, but are defined by the Trump administration as efforts that deliberately obstruct immigration enforcement.
A list of sanctuary jurisdictions distributed by DHS in late May included Las Vegas. DHS removed the list days later following backlash from the named cities and counties.
“Lombardo and McMahill are capitulating to an agenda of hate,” said Bliss Requa-Trautz, executive director of Arriba Las Vegas Workers Center, which assists workers with immigration and employment issues. “This is not about law enforcement. This is about repression.” 
The threatened loss of funds, she says, is being used by Trump “to manipulate our state and local officials into implementing the federal deportation agenda.”
Requa-Trautz says Metro’s application to revive its 287(g) designation is also a public relations move to “get away from the sanctuary city accusation, which is totally false,” and keep ICE activity from the public’s view and off the minds of tourists. 
“If they actually implement the full Trump agenda as planned, we’re going to be leading boycotts of the Strip, because it’s not safe to come here,” says Requa-Trautz. Stepped-up ICE raids in Nevada could “start contributing to the fears of visitors if we don’t have a community that is safe for those who live and work and vacation here.” 
Real ID requirements for air travelers could also cut into tourism, she says, adding immigrants, documented and undocumented, who regularly fly have been grounded. “People took their last trips in April, and they are done flying.”
Cataliotti, the New York immigration attorney who represents professionals in a variety of fields, including entertainment and sports, says immigration arrests “have spooked a lot of folks who would otherwise be quite confident” about travelling to the U.S., a factor that could complicate entertainment and sports attractions on the Strip.
Scared silent?
Until recently, ICE enforcement in Southern Nevada has been targeted, Requa-Trautz says, but the targets, for the most part, are far from dangerous criminals. The methods employed by ICE to apprehend them, she says, such as masked men in unmarked vehicles plucking individuals off the streets, are fraught with peril. “In a state like Nevada, someone could get shot,” she said.
“In a heavily armed country, something can go really wrong,” said Kagan. 
Kagan affords Lombardo, a Republican, a little grace on the topic, given the state has no role in the immigration actions taken by federal authorities.
“I’m not sure that Lombardo wants to be fully in bed with the Trump immigration agenda, particularly if it starts leading to roundups of people who don’t have criminal records who are going to court,” said Kagan. “I don’t think he wants to speak about it either.”
The silence from Democrats, he says, “is deafening. This is a missed opportunity, morally and politically, for Democrats. They have been afraid of the issue for the wrong reasons for too long, and that’s a serious failure of leadership.”
Kagan suggests Democrats “have felt lost on the issue of immigration for a while, and the election scared some of them into silence. You can see that in our own delegation.” 
U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Southern Nevada, says he’s “very concerned” about ICE tactics under Trump, such as “agents who were not in uniform, who were in unmarked cars, who were wearing masks, who literally have not been identifying themselves at these raid incidents.That is not making our community safer in any regard.”
Nevada’s U.S. senators have also voiced opposition to several policies.
In April, Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was one of 19 senators to urge Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to reinstate temporary protected status (TPS) to some 350,000 Venezuelans. Congress, she and the others wrote to Noem and Rubio, “intended TPS to be both a humanitarian tool and a pragmatic response to unstable conditions abroad.” 
“This administration should be focused on targeting violent criminals, not on using their resources to intimidate hardworking immigrant families,” Cortez Masto said in a statement to the Current. 
Cortez Masto and U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) say they’ve been denied deportation data.
“Our office has not received any data from ICE or DHS regarding deportations, which is in line with the Trump Administration’s unprecedented lack of transparency,” said a spokesperson for Rosen. 
Rosen opposes “deportation efforts targeting law-abiding individuals, and she’s against immigration enforcement in sensitive locations that are meant to intimidate and scare immigrant communities.”
Cortez Masto and Rosen are supporting a bill that would prevent immigration raids at “sensitive areas” such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. Trump rescinded those protections when he took office. 
In the last month, ICE has begun apprehending individuals at immigration hearings, which are not included among the named sensitive locations. 
Last week, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) joined House colleagues who signed on to a letter to Noem and Rubio complaining the policy, “designed to meet an arbitrary quota of deportations, is not targeting criminals — the ‘worst of the worst’ as administration officials have repeatedly claimed — but instead is surreptitiously and deceptively aimed at those who are following the rules, voluntarily appearing in court, and doing it the right way.” 
The letter was not signed by Horsford or Rep. Susie Lee, the only Democrat in the Nevada delegation who did not respond to requests for comment. 
Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s tactics continue to put migrants who are trying to work within the legal system in a frightening quandary. Immigrants who do not appear for hearings can be deported in absentia, creating a dilemma –  appear and be taken into custody, or face the consequences for failing to appear. 
“An attorney could not tell you not to go to a hearing,” says Requa-Trautz of Arriba Workers Center. “And an attorney cannot tell you that you will walk out of there.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2218844607-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by R. Taylor/National Park Service)After an Anchorage Superior Court judge struck down a state program that kills bears in order to help caribou hunters, the Alaska Board of Game is proposing a new version of the program.
According to a public notice published Friday, the board will meet in July in Anchorage to consider changing the state’s predator control program to allow the killing of “brown and black bears in addition to wolves to aid in the recovery of the Mulchatna caribou herd.”
Alaska’s predator control program, implemented in various places across the state, involves killing predator animals in an attempt to boost prey populations for hunters.
The Mulchatna caribou herd’s population has declined dramatically in recent decades, from about 200,000 in the 1990s to about 15,000 as of 2024, according to estimates published by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. 
Hunting from the herd has been banned since 2021, and the department believes that predation by bears is preventing the herd from expanding to a size that will support hunting.
Critics of the program have said the decline is more likely due to other reasons, including a rapidly changing habitat, disease and past overhunting. Climate change is leading to more woody plants growing on the tundra, affecting the caribou, which eat lichen.
The Alaska Wildlife Alliance filed suit against the state in 2023, arguing that ADF&G’s implementation of the predator control program with regard to Mulchatna was unconstitutional.
In part, the alliance argued that the state failed to study the implications for the area’s bear population, which includes animals that live part of the year in the Katmai National Park and Preserve.
That case resulted in a court order against the state, which attempted to continue the bear kills through an emergency regulation. Judge Christina Rankin found the state had acted “in bad faith” when it kept killing bears despite a restraining order against ADF&G.
The court is now considering whether it should hold state officials in contempt.
Meanwhile, the new public notice shows the state is attempting to authorize the bear kills in a different way that could be effective ahead of next spring’s caribou calving season.
“To correct the court-identified administrative issues, the Alaska Board of Game will hold a special meeting in July to discuss the restoration of the Intensive Management Program, as the administration is committed to protecting rural subsistence resources,” said Shannon Mason, a spokesperson for the ADF&G.
“Our predator control program, supported by local users, communities, advisory committees, and the Alaska Federation of Natives, had already shown success with improved calf survival and herd growth. As we have said before, halting the program now, in its third year, jeopardizes our progress. That’s why we’re pursuing our options to ensure the program can continue under Alaska’s intensive management statute,” she said.
Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy ordered a freeze on new state regulations earlier this year, but Mason said by phone that the new predator control program is not subject to that freeze because the new regulations are an extension of an effort that was underway before the freeze took effect.

Jackson filed an early voting bill this session, which was not considered by a committee, along with other voting-related bills. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A collection of bills aimed to enhance voting access in Alabama were never considered by committees during the 2025 legislative session, but advocates say the fight for enhanced voting rights in Alabama is not over
HB 59, sponsored by Rep. Thomas Jackson, D-Thomasville, would have required one early voting precinct in each county for one week before Election Day. According to a study by the Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR), about 70% of the ballots cast nationwide in 2020 were cast before Election Day, and 40% were cast before Election Day in 2016. In 2016, 25% of ballots nationwide were cast through early in-person voting, of the states that offer the option, according to the study.
“Senior citizens really brought it to my attention,” Jackson said in an interview on Monday. “So I drafted it, and I put it the simplest way that I could do it: a week out before the election, four days prior to the elections, and nobody liked that. Republicans don’t like that.”
Alabama does not allow early voting and does not have no-excuse absentee voting. Amid the COVID pandemic in 2020, state leaders effectively allowed anyone to cast an absentee ballot, but that was rescinded after the election. 
The League of Women Voters of Alabama supported the measures. Kim Bailey, president of the league, said in an interview Thursday that the bills would expand access to voting in Alabama, which would increase voter turnout in the state.
“You can make a plan, but if something comes up on voting day, you may not be able to get to the ballot box,” Bailey said. “Voting as a right and not a privilege. I think that’s important that they’d be able to exercise that right.”
In 2024, there were 3.7 million people registered to vote in Alabama, according to the Secretary of State’s website. But only 2.2 million (59%) people voted in the 2024 Presidential election. That was significantly less than the national voter turnout of 88% in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the lowest percentage of Alabama voters to cast ballots in a presidential election since 1988. 
The bill was assigned to the House Constitution, Campaigns and Elections Committee, but Rep. Bob Fincher, R-Woodland, chair of the committee, said he did not take HB 59 up in his committee because he is not in favor of early voting due to the cost to the state. 
“It costs the state extra money when you vote early,” he said. “If there’s a change in the campaign, you cannot go back and change your vote.”
The Legislative Services Agency did not provide a fiscal note for any of the election access related bills. Although a total cost is not available, Bailey said early voting would utilize state employees that are already working and would be held at locations that are already staffed. 
“That wouldn’t require a lot of infrastructure cost in those kinds of things, so depending on what the legislation that passes the cost could be not really very much,” Bailey said.
Jackson said the potential cost to the state for a week of early voting would be much less than the cost to the state for unconstitutional bills and the congressional redistricting trial. In the state’s General Fund budget, a $300,000 line item was added for “reapportionment litigation fees.”
“We don’t have an idea of the cost to the state. Look at all these lawsuits, these millions of dollars that are being paid to lawyers for these unconstitutional bills. That’s a cost to the state,” Jackson said. “See, they can come up with any excuse when they don’t want something.”
Jerome Dees, the Alabama policy director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in an interview Thursday that he was not surprised the bills were not considered. He said the state has been regressing in voting access and inclusivity for the last decade.
“This bill is really kind of an effort to try and present a new vision of what democracy can and should be in Alabama, which is kind of the home of the civil rights movement,” Dees said. 
In fact, Dees said the state’s congressional redistricting trial has highlighted the need for more voter protections and access. 
“The fact that not a single one of these bills that aimed to expand voter access to create oversight over the redistricting process, whether that’s at the municipal level, drawing of city council districts or at the state and federal level,” Dees said. “According to the federal courts, is obviously a problem, just based on recent rulings. The fact that the Legislature intentionally chose not to touch any of those, I think, is as telling as anything.”
In 2021, the Alabama Legislature approved congressional district maps that were later challenged in court and struck down in 2022 by a three-judge panel, which ordered the districts to be redrawn. In 2023, the Legislature redrew the maps, which were again challenged by plaintiffs for not meeting the court’s requirement of allowing Black voters to elect a candidate of their choice in a second district. 
The court struck down the 2023 map passed by the Legislature and appointed a special master to submit three potential remedial maps in time for the 2024 election. The Alabama Attorney General’s Office said last month the state may forgo drawing new congressional district maps before 2030 to prevent federal oversight of future redistricting, pausing the redistricting for five years. 
HB 97, sponsored by Rep. Kenyatté Hassell, D-Montgomery, would have allowed voters to cure their absentee ballot affidavit if they submit them before the election and the absentee election manager finds an error. Currently, the ballots are set aside and not counted if election officials find a defect with the affidavits.
Hassell said in an interview on Wednesday that the bill would have given absentee voters a better chance for their ballot to be counted.
“People were making mistakes on their ballots, and even though they didn’t know they made mistakes,” he said. “We might have people who voted on an absentee ballot for the last 20 years, and their vote never counted because they made the same mistake over and over again not knowing they made that mistake.”
The bill was assigned to Fincher’s committee, but Fincher said he did not take it up because of conversations with Hassell and the Secretary of State Wes Allen. 
“I’ve been very clear, I believe in Election Day, not Election month,” Allen said in a statement Monday.
Hassell raised concerns that the executive branch had control over what bills did or did not get taken up in committee.
“When one person in the executive branch has an agenda, that shouldn’t dictate if we all feel like this is a good piece of legislation that’ll help the citizens,” Hassell said. “That’s why we have a House. That’s why we have a Senate.”
HB 31, sponsored by Rep. Adline Clarke, D-Mobile, allows people with a disability, or those unable to read or write, to designate someone to assist them with delivering an absentee ballot application or the absentee ballot itself, to the election manager. 
Messages seeking comment from Clarke were left Wednesday and Monday.
Dees and Bailey expect the bills to be filed again for the 2026 Legislative Session.
“We’re going to keep filing this year, I’m gonna keep filing until something happens,” Jackson said. “We just have to keep hitting that rock until they crack. That’s why I’m still pushing it, because it’s the right thing to do, and the people of the state want it.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Thomas-Jackson-Nathaniel-Ledbetter-March-6-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(DOTD video via Franklin Associates)The Louisiana Legislature’s leaders want to spend $1.2 billion that would typically be deposited into a state savings account on infrastructure, economic development and technology upgrades. 
State lawmakers expect to send Gov. Jeff Landry a $48 billion budget plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 by the time their legislative session concludes Thursday. The current plan includes additional money for roadways and bridges ($709 million), economic development site upgrades ($150 million), state government technology improvements ($59.8 million) and public university maintenance projects ($28 million). 
The money comes from a state savings account called the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund, which takes in corporate taxes as well as energy production taxes in excess of $600 million each per year. Established by voters in 2016, the fund was set up to provide an additional source of funding to Louisiana during economic downturns when the state faces budget crises. 

Lawmakers gave themselves a significant amount of latitude in the law to access the fund at any time, so long as they can get two-thirds of the House and Senate to vote to draw down the money.

The Senate voted unanimously Monday through House Bill 461 to withdraw $1.2 billion. The House is expected to approve the same plan Wednesday or Thursday. 
Louisiana is not in the midst of a budget crisis but legislators feel confident about using the money anyway because the state’s two major savings accounts are flush with cash. They also took $717 million out of the account just last year, mostly for transportation and youth prison projects. 

Even after the withdrawal, the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund will have $2.7 billion left. There’s also more than $1.1 billion in the Budget Stabilization Trust Fund, a separate account often referred to as the state “rainy day” fund used to cover budget shortfalls. 

Here are some highlights of how the money will be spent: 

$280 million: Transportation funding to attract federal money 
Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, said this allocation will be used to draw down $1.3 billion in federal funding for transportation projects that could include both new construction and maintenance of existing infrastructure. A list of specific items that would be funded was not provided. 

$240 million: Transportation preservation projects
This money would be used to fix and upgrade existing transportation infrastructure, according to McFarland. On top of this money, an additional $63 million is going directly to state transportation districts, where it can also be used for that purpose. 

$150 million: Louisiana economic development site investment
The Louisiana Economic Development agency requested this funding in order to pay for physical upgrades and infrastructure at specific sites where the state hopes to attract private sector investment. 

For example, the state has already committed to spending millions of dollars to build new roads around the site of the anticipated Hyundai steel mill in Ascension Parish. It will also reimburse Hyundai for some of the construction the company undertakes to build its facility at that location, according to The Times-Picayune. It’s unclear whether any of this funding is committed to the Hyundai project or others recently announced. 
On top of this allocation, the economic development agency will also receive an additional $74 million for its “debt service and commitments program” from the $1.2 billion. The department will also get $5 million to launch a marketing campaign for the state. 
$101 million: Bridge upgrades 

McFarland said Louisiana intends to “bundle up” bridge maintenance projects – around 20 at a time – and put them out to bid as a collective in order to get a better price on the construction work. This money would be used to pay for that work. 
$75 million: Water system upgrades 
This money is supposed to be used to improve local drinking water and sewerage systems in Louisiana. The state has put hundreds of millions of dollars toward similar projects since 2021, but the repairs needed are estimated to cost billions of dollars. 
$29 million: College campus deferred maintenance 
The funding will support delayed construction projects and repairs at public universities and colleges. It includes $3 million for work at the University of New Orleans, which is being transferred to the LSU System later this year. 
$24.1 million: OMV technology upgrades
The state Office of Motor Vehicles experienced outages of its system this spring, leading Gov. Jeff Landry to declare a state of emergency and waive driver’s license fees  as members of the public struggled to access the system. The technology motor vehicle offices rely on is approximately 50 years old. 
$10 million: LIV Golf and other ‘major’ events
Lawmakers will combine this money with other state funds in the Major Events Incentive Fund for a total of $16.4 million in spending for tourist-heavy events that are expected to generate revenue. 

These include $7 million for a LIV Golf League event in New Orleans; $3.5 million for the months-long U.S. Bowling Congress Tournament in Baton Rouge; $1.2 million for Essence Festival in New Orleans and $1.5 million for an Ultimate Fighting Championship event in New Orleans. 

$10 million: New voting machines 

For years, Louisiana has been trying to purchase new voting machines to replace ones that are more than three decades old. This allocation comes as lawmakers passed legislation to change the bid process for purchasing a voting system earlier this month. 
$5 million: Upgrade to Medicaid eligibility system 
This money is supposed to allow Louisiana to upgrade the technology it uses to make sure Medicaid recipients are eligible for the public health insurance benefit. The Louisiana Department of Health recently announced its intention to start cross-checking its Medicaid rolls with other state databases, including those used by the Office of Motor Vehicles. 

$4 million: More grass cutting on state roads
This allocation will be used to pay for additional cycles of mowing along state roads over the next fiscal cycle. 
$3 million: AI tool for monitoring state prisoner phone calls 

Louisiana’s prison system will receive $3 million to help pay for an artificial intelligence tool that monitors and collects data on phone calls from state prisoners. The program Verus, made by the company LeoTech, is used to detect criminal activity, prevent self-harm and assist with public safety, according to the LeoTech’s website. 

The company says it does not monitor communication between incarcerated people and their attorneys, spiritual advisors or doctors. 
$3 million: Louisiana Supreme Court building security 

The court is receiving a blanket $1.8 million to upgrade security at its facility in the French Quarter in New Orleans. Another $1.1 million has been allocated specifically for additional fencing around the building. 
$1.8 million: State police payment for the ‘recapture of fugitives’ 

The state’s top law enforcement agency is receiving $1.8 million for “expenses related to the recapture of fugitives.” 

It’s not stated explicitly, but this money may be going to reimburse state police for assisting with the 10-person jailbreak that occurred at the New Orleans jail in May.

(NurPhoto/Corbis via Getty Images)When people use the term “Orwellian,” it’s not a good sign.
It usually characterizes an action, an individual or a society that is suppressing freedom, particularly the freedom of expression. It can also describe something perverted by tyrannical power.
It’s a term used primarily to describe the present, but whose implications inevitably connect to both the future and the past.
In his second term, President Donald Trump has revealed his ambitions to rewrite America’s official history to, in the words of the Organization of American Historians, “reflect a glorified narrative … while suppressing the voices of historically excluded groups.”
Such ambitions are deeply Orwellian. Here’s how.
Author George Orwell believed in objective, historical truth. Writing in 1946, he attributed his youthful desire to become an author in part to a “historical impulse,” or “the desire to see things as they are, to find out true facts and store them up for the use of posterity.”
But while Orwell believed in the existence of an objective truth about history, he did not necessarily believe that truth would prevail.
 Winners write the history

During World War II, the Nazis broadcast reports on German radio describing nonexistent air raids over Britain.
Orwell knew about those reports and wrote: “Now, we are aware that those raids did not happen. But what use would our knowledge be if the Germans conquered Britain? For the purposes of a future historian, did those raids happen, or didn’t they?”
The answer, Orwell wrote, was, “If Hitler survives, they happened, and if he falls, they didn’t happen. So with innumerable other events of the past ten or twenty years. … In no case do you get one answer which is universally accepted because it is true: in each case you get a number of totally incompatible answers, one of which is finally adopted as the result of a physical struggle. History is written by the winners.”
As Orwell wrote in “1984,” his final, dystopian novel, “Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.”
Power, Orwell appreciated, allowed those who possessed it to create their own historical narrative. It also allowed those in power to silence or censor opposing narratives, quashing the possibility of productive dialogue about history that could ultimately allow truth to come out.
 The Ministry of Truth

The desire to eradicate counternarratives drives Winston Smith’s job at the ironically named Ministry of Truth in “1984.”
The novel is set in Oceania, a geographical entity covering North America and the British Isles and which governs much of the Global South.
Oceania is an absolute tyranny governed by Big Brother, the leader of a political party whose only goal is the perpetuation of its own power. In this society, truth is what Big Brother and the party say it is.
The regime imposes near total censorship so that not only dissident speech but subversive private reflection, or “thought crime,” is viciously prosecuted. In this way, it controls the present.
But it also controls the past. As the party’s protean policy evolves, Smith and his colleagues are tasked with systematically destroying any historical records that conflict with the current version of history. Smith literally disposes of artifacts of inexpedient history by throwing them down “memory holes,” where they are “wiped … out of existence and out of memory.”
At a key point in the novel, Smith recalls briefly holding on to a newspaper clipping that proved that an enemy of the regime had not actually committed the crime he had been accused of. Smith recognizes the power over the regime that this clipping gives him, but he simultaneously fears that power will make him a target. In the end, fear of retaliation leads him to drop the slip of newsprint down a memory hole.
The contemporary U.S. is a far cry from Orwell’s Oceania. Yet the Trump administration is doing its best to exert control over the present and the past.
 Down the memory hole

The Trump administration has taken unprecedented steps to rewrite the nation’s official history, attempting to purge parts of the historical narrative down Orwellian memory holes.
Comically, those efforts included the temporary removal from government websites of information about the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the atomic bomb over Hiroshima. The plane was unwittingly caught up in a mass purge of references to “gay” and LGBTQ+ content on government websites.
Other erasures have included the deletion of content on government sites related to the life of Harriet Tubman, the Maryland woman who escaped slavery and then played a pioneering role as a conductor of the Underground Railroad, helping enslaved people escape to freedom.
The administration also directed the removal of content concerning the Tuskegee Airmen, the group of African American pilots who flew missions in World War II.
In these cases, public outcry led to the restoration of the deleted content, but other less high-profile deletions have been allowed to stand.
Over the past several months, many of Trump’s opponents have bemoaned the fecklessness of the Democratic Party in mounting an effective opposition to the president’s agenda.
Critics on the right and even some on the left denounced as little more than a stunt New Jersey Sen. Corey Booker’s marathon 25-hour speech on the U.S. Senate floor detailing the constitutional abuses of Trump’s first few months.
But while words are no substitute for action, in the face of a regime that is intent on stifling voices of dissent, from media outlets to law firms, to university campuses, through a combination of formal censorship and informal coercion and bullying, the act of speaking out matters.
Booker’s protest will be written into the Congressional Record and remain a part of the nation’s contested history.
So too will the meticulous recounting of the administration’s constitutional abuses in publications such as The Atlantic and The New York Times. The existence of such a record allows the potential for a critical historical narrative to be written in the future.
But the administration is also looking ahead.
 Repressing thought

Current proponents of the “anti-woke” agenda at both the federal and state level are focused on reshaping educational curricula in a way that will make it inconceivable for future generations to question their historical claims.
Orwell’s “1984” ends with an appendix on the history of “Newspeak,” Oceania’s official language, which, while it had not yet superseded “Oldspeak” or standard English, was rapidly gaining ground as both a written and spoken dialect.
According to the appendix, “The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the worldview and mental habits proper to the devotees of [the Party], but to make all other modes of thought impossible.”
Orwell, as so often in his writing, makes the abstract theory concrete: “The word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as ‘This dog is free from lice’ or ‘This field is free from weeds.’ … political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts.”
The goal of this language streamlining was total control over past, present and future.
If it is illegal to even speak of systemic racism, for example, let alone discuss its causes and possible remedies, it constrains the potential for, even prohibits, social change.
It has become a cliché that those who do not understand history are bound to repeat it. As George Orwell appreciated, the correlate is that social and historical progress require an awareness of, and receptivity to, both historical fact and competing historical narratives.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)An effort to eliminate confidentiality for people who provide tips to the Louisiana Board of Ethics over government misconduct has failed. 
Louisiana Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said House Bill 160 won’t come up for consideration after it missed a crucial deadline for an initial vote in the Senate Monday. 
“There weren’t the votes” to pass the proposal, Rep. Kellee Hennessy Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, who sponsored the legislation, said in an interview Monday night. 
The bill would have required the ethics board to reveal the name of a person who provides a tip about alleged wrongdoing to whoever the person accuses of misconduct. Currently, the ethics board never shares a tipster’s identity with the target of an investigation.
The proposal would also have required ethics board tips to be either signed by a notary or delivered in person to the ethics board staff at their office in downtown Baton Rouge. 
The board enforces the state’s ethics and campaign finance laws for elected officials, public employees, lobbyists and government contractors. On Friday, board members sent a letter to senators encouraging them to vote against the legislation, saying it would have a chilling effect on the public’s willingness to provide the board information. 

Dickerson described the ethics board’s letter as “harassing” and said it helped kill the bill. 

“I guess people fear the retaliation of the ethics board being against it,” she said.  

Dickerson drafted the proposal in response to her own experience with the ethics board. In 2023, the board fined her $1,500 when she was a member of the Livingston Parish School Board and running for state representative. The ethics board concluded she had broken state ethics laws by inappropriately helping a public school teacher get a construction contract at the high school where the teacher was employed. 

Before Dickerson’s bill stalled, lawmakers had already approved another piece of legislation that creates new barriers for bringing charges over an ethics violation. 

A large share of the board will need to vote in favor of launching an ethics investigation, and the deadline for bringing charges will be more difficult to meet, under House Bill 674 by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia.

About H.454…


As a college student, I’ve pulled many all-nighters. And I find that, oftentimes, I will look at my midnight scribbles a few days later and question my very sanity.
Now, I’m worried that the Vermont Legislature is pulling all-nighter after all-nighter, and in a year when they look back, they will regret the very urgency compelling them forward.
Because I’ve realized that meaningful work can’t be done overnight, or even in a few days. It takes time and consideration. 
Last night, at 12 a.m., I was sitting in my room reading hundreds of pages of information on H.454, the education transformation bill. After a while, I realized something. 
I don’t know what in the world this bill is doing.

READ MORE

I mean, I agree with and understand some aspects, but some of it is spinning my head in circles. Furthermore, this bill is a Band-Aid that doesn’t address the real cost drivers, such as health care. It’s trying to fix something in a few weeks that is decades deep into Vermont’s soil.
So after consideration, I’m asking the Legislature one thing: take your time. If you’re at all — as policymakers — confused and angry about H.454, imagine the students, teachers, parents, and community members on the ground who feel this way. 
We don’t all have time to read through the 100 pages or listen to testimony, or even give testimony. But maybe it’s because we haven’t been given the tools to understand the root causes of this system’s issues.
Instead of rushing to pass a full bill without the time and care it requires, let’s spend the summer and fall working in coalition with communities to understand education reform and search for the collective answers we seek.
A bill must pass, that much is true, but perhaps some of it can wait for a larger conversation. That is up to the Legislature. All I am asking is for you to consider the detrimental effects of urgency.
Only together, only with time, and only with compassion can we push education reform in Vermont. Maybe, just maybe, we should take some time to rest and reconsider before drastically changing our state.
Because for as much as I love and dedicate my life to education, I have no idea what H.454 is about anymore.

The House’s approach to H.454 recognizes the complexity of the task ahead and responsibly moves us toward a more equitable and sustainable public education system.

She is vice chair of the Commission on the Future of Public Education and vice chair of the Winooski School District board of trustees. She has previously served as the general counsel and executive director for the Vermont School Boards Association and the director of finance and operations at the Winooski School District. She currently serves as the dean of administration for the Community College of Vermont.


The stalemate in Montpelier over the fate of H.454 belies the strong consensus on the need for Vermont’s public education system to evolve and the urgency with which we must approach that effort.
Vermont’s education fund is projected to allocate more than $2.3 billion this year to educate 80,000 students and fund a variety of legislative initiatives. Our outcomes are not equitable. Our school buildings are falling into disrepair. The status quo is not sustainable and the fate of our public education system hangs in the balance.
Despite near-universal agreement with the above problem statement, Vermonters are not on the same page about what to do about it. Some believe we need to add income tax revenue to the education fund to take the pressure off the property tax; others believe we should close small schools; some say we need to fix our health care system (or housing system, mental health system, etc); many think we need to control spending and cost centers at the state level; others believe we just need fewer superintendents and central offices.
Based on my years of service in public education at the state and local level, I think the answer is all of the above. Changing the funding system alone will not lower costs for Vermont taxpayers. Neither will closing schools or creating larger districts. But a coordinated and carefully paced plan to address funding, governance, and quality in concert could make a positive difference.

Changing public school governance and finance at the same time significantly increases the complexity of the task and the risk of doing damage to our public schools. H. 454, as passed by the House, lays out a path for the state to take careful steps in the evolution of our public education system.
The House-passed bill, developed in partnership with education leaders and subject matter experts, recognizes the need for cost drivers to be addressed and paces the implementation of funding changes to align with governance change, class size minimums, school building improvements, and multi-tiered systems of supports. The House’s proposed funding formula provides sufficient resources more equitably than our current system, grounded in research and the Vermont context. 
Our public education system has been evolving over the past several decades to respond to the realities of our demographic decline. The legislature has attempted to address concerns over increasing costs and inequitable outcomes using a variety of different policy levers — Acts 60, 68, 153, 156, 46, 173 and 127. We have a lot of lessons to learn from the implementation of those policies.
One lesson is that Vermonters care deeply about their public schools. Students and families have strong connections to the community that is built around their school. If communities feel that decisions about funding, curriculum, and programs are being made without regard for their priorities, assets and needs, support for our public schools will erode. It is important that through the process of reform, communities feel they have a voice and a stake in a reimagined public education system.
Another lesson is that policy interventions that tackle one component of our system in isolation and without strong leadership and support from the Agency of Education will falter. Despite the policy goal in Act 46 of leveraging larger districts to achieve efficiencies and improve quality, there was inadequate technical assistance provided by the Agency to school districts post-merger on how to do so.
The same is true for Act 173. The special education funding model changed, but resources to change instructional practices have been insufficient; some of the rules promulgated by the State Board seem at odds with the act’s purpose. A lack of cohesion and support from the state means critical policy objectives are not achieved. 
Vermont cannot afford to have this legislative session end without clarity on how our public school funding, governance and quality assurance systems will evolve. But clarity should not come at the expense of thoughtful, research-based policy that gives elected officials and the educators of this state time to involve the public in the design of these changes, and the on-the-ground support required to get it right.
The House’s approach to H.454 recognizes the complexity of the task ahead and responsibly moves us toward a more equitable and sustainable public education system.

The state ranks 27th, down one spot from last year, according to an analysis from the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Ten years ago, Washington was 20th.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal’s office took issue with the rankings, arguing that the National Assessment of Educational Progress data the report is based on shouldn’t be used to construct such lists.
More than two-thirds of the state’s 4th graders failed to meet reading standards, and 70% of 8th graders weren’t proficient in math last year, right around the national average — and where Washington pupils stood in 2022.
For two decades, reading proficiency has remained largely unchanged in Washington. In 2005, 64% of the state’s 4th graders failed to meet reading standards. The number improved, falling to just 60% in 2013 and 2015, but last year climbed to a new high of 68%.
Math proficiency among 8th graders dropped over the past decade, from 58% not meeting standards in 2013, to 70% last year, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its toll on student learning and a rise in chronic absenteeism nationally.
A spokesperson for Reykdal pointed to state data showing “robust” improvement since the pandemic. The percentage of students on track in reading and math was up in the 2023-24 school year from the pandemic era, according to state data.
“Our performance in reading is strong, and OSPI and Superintendent Reykdal understand the need for increased focus on and funding for mathematics, particularly in late elementary and middle school,” spokesperson Katie Hannig said in an email Monday. “This is one of the Superintendent’s top priorities moving forward.”
One worrisome data point shows Washington’s youngest learners are missing out on school. Of 3- and 4-year-old children, 57% weren’t enrolled in school from 2019 to 2023, slightly worse than the national average. 
Stephan Blanford, executive director of the Children’s Alliance based in Seattle, said this lays the groundwork for below-average on-time graduation rates. The alliance is the foundation’s partner in Washington on the report known as the Kids Count Data Book.
Sixteen percent of Washington students didn’t graduate on time in 2021 and 2022, the report says, below the 13% national average.
“The fact that our state has made such significant cuts in early education as a result of the last legislative session means it’s pretty easy to predict that these numbers are on the way downward,” said Blanford, speaking broadly about education trends. “There was so much work that was done in order to get them to their current level.”
“Our slide is going to be precipitous,” he added.
State lawmakers agreed this year to delay previously approved expansions to state-paid early learning in the face of a hefty budget shortfall. And the Trump administration has put the federal Head Start early learning program for low-income families in its crosshairs.
These programs help students learn to manage their feelings, and kids who participate are more likely to go on to college and earn more money as adults.
Blanford voiced disappointment that state leaders, particularly Gov. Bob Ferguson, couldn’t reach agreement this year on new revenue options to better fund education.
Ferguson’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment Monday.
Meanwhile, school districts are grappling with tough budget decisions of their own as federal aid provided during the pandemic has dried up, and as enrollment is down in many places. State funding is linked to student headcounts. 
Hannig, from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, said the state budget cuts “cause OSPI concern, and we are exploring options to keep our preschool-age learners learning, despite these reductions in funding.” 
Still, she noted state data shows 53.6% of Washington’s students entered kindergarten ready this school year, a figure that has risen consistently in recent years.
The Kids Count Data Book also tracks family, health and economic data trends. For example, in 2023, just 3% of Washington children lacked health insurance, better than the national average of 5%. And only 12% were impoverished, also better than the average.
As for child well-being, Washington ranks 16th, down from 14th last year.

The region is among the areas meant to benefit from the BEAD program for rural broadband access. (Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)The Trump administration on Friday released revised rules for a federal program meant to widely expand broadband access, stripping the Biden-era effort of many key requirements and making it easier for Elon Musk’s company to win grants.
Under the revised guidelines, the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program, known as BEAD, will take a technology-neutral approach to expanding broadband access rather than focusing on fiber internet. The original program favored fiber because of its speed, reliability, and ability to reach remote locations.
The change opens the door for more internet providers to use BEAD grants for technologies including satellite internet service, which is provided by Elon Musk’s Starlink. Under the new rules, Starlink could receive $10 billion to $20 billion in BEAD money, up from $4.1 billion the company would have received under the original rules, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Groups applying for BEAD funding will no longer be required to offer a low-cost service option for internet users in locations they are serving. Some states had proposed services as low as $30 a month.
Instead, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration now encourages internet providers to propose their “existing, market driven low-cost plans” to meet the cost requirement.
As part of the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives within the government, the new guidelines also remove provisions that encouraged states to work with companies and representatives from minority communities. Requirements related to labor, the environment, and climate change also were cut.
And the agency eliminated a provision of the original program that encouraged states to seek out non-traditional providers, including municipalities or political subdivisions that provide internet service.
Louisiana’s, Nevada’s, and Delaware’s proposals, which had been approved, will be rescinded.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick promised to launch a rigorous review of the BEAD program in March, saying in a statement that because of “woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies, and burdensome regulations, the program has not connected a single person to the internet and is in dire need of a readjustment.”
In April, the Trump administration gave states an additional 90 days to submit their final plans for the $42.45 billion program in anticipation of the changes, further delaying an effort that’s set to go back to the planning phase after more than three years.
Evan Feinman, the former director of the BEAD program, said states will now have to rework their proposals again.
“For some reason, [Secretary] Lutnick, who said the program was going too slowly, wants to slow the program down much more, force states and the private sector to do a ton of extra work, and spend a bunch of extra taxpayer money all so we can get worse connections to people that will cost them more every month,” he said.
The Internet & Television Association, a trade association representing the broadband and cable industries, praised the new guidelines in a statement, saying, “We welcome changes to the BEAD program that will make the program more efficient and eliminate onerous requirements, which add unnecessary costs that impede broadband deployment efforts.”
But Drew Garner, the director of policy engagement at the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, said in a statement that the changes will “cement the digital divide for decades.” The Benton Institute is a nonprofit organization championing digital access for all.
“[Lutnick] is hurting our economic competitiveness, our healthcare and education, and our ability to work and stay connected with loved ones,” Garner said in the statement. “He is denying rural Americans access to the modern economy and our increasingly connected world.”

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek is still legally driving more than five months after an alleged drunken driving incident in Michigan City, and the Republican lawmaker has asked to keep his license — so long as he installs an alcohol-monitoring device in his car, according to new court documents.
The June 5 motion, filed in LaPorte Superior Court by Bohacek’s Michigan City-based attorney, David Payne, requests the installation of an ignition interlock device, or IID, as an alternative to license suspension. 
Under Indiana law, courts can order such devices in lieu of suspending driving privileges when someone is charged with operating while intoxicated, if doing so would cause a hardship. Bohacek also refused a breathalyzer test during the traffic stop.
Payne argued that suspension of Bohacek’s license would impose “a substantial hardship” on the senator and his family.
Indiana GOP Sen. Mike Bohacek charged with DUI months after incident

There was no ruling on the request as of Monday afternoon.
The case remains without a judge, and legal proceedings have been stalled for weeks due to multiple judicial recusals. 
Three special judges, all in LaPorte County, opted out from the case one after another.
Then, all the judges and magistrates of LaPorte County filed a motion saying they collectively “have a conflict herein and they all hereby recuse themselves in this cause of action.”
Judge Jeffrey L. Thode of the Superior Court in neighboring Porter County, was assigned the case last week but has not yet accepted, according to the state’s online court portal. A special prosecutor from Porter County is handling the matter.
The underlying charges, filed May 15, stem from a Jan. 24 incident in Michigan City, after a citizen reported seeing Bohacek “drinking an open container and stumble out of his vehicle” in a Panda Express parking lot, according to charging documents obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
Police later located and pulled him over near Swan Lake Cemetery along U.S. 20. He was taken to a hospital, where a blood test revealed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.28% — more than three times the legal limit in Indiana.
But Bohacek wasn’t arrested at the time. Under Indiana law, members of the General Assembly are shielded from arrest in most cases during the legislative session — a protection known as legislative immunity.
That meant Bohacek’s case was kept sealed and the senator remained uncharged for months.
The incident did not become public until last week when reporters began asking for details. Court records show Bohacek was formally charged with three misdemeanors: operating a vehicle with an alcohol concentration equivalent of 0.15% or more; operating a vehicle while intoxicated endangering a person; and operating a vehicle while intoxicated.

Bohacek’s license has not been suspended. Typically, Indiana law requires a license suspension following a court’s finding of probable cause in DUI cases, as well as when a person refuses a breathalyzer test. But without a sitting judge, that process has stalled.
Bohacek has not commented publicly on the case.
Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, didn’t specify when he learned about the incident or if any disciplinary action was taken during the 2025 legislative session, or since adjournment. 
“I was extremely disappointed to hear this news, and I expressed my disappointment to Sen. Bohacek,” Bray said in a statement. “Our Senate Rules make clear members are to be held to high standards, and this does not meet that standard. Here in Indiana, nobody is above the law. I will be monitoring this case as it goes forward and our legal system does its work, after which I will consider any next steps.”
Bohacek, who represents portions of LaPorte, St. Joseph and Starke counties, has served in the Indiana Senate since 2016. He most recently served on the Corrections and Criminal Law, Health and Provider Services, and Local Government committees.
Since charges were filed against Bohacek, details have emerged about a similar case involving Rep. Jason “Beau” Baird, R-Greencastle, who was arrested in 2018 for operating while intoxicated in Lafayette during his first campaign for office. 
Baird pleaded guilty to OWI and later accepted a plea agreement in 2019, after taking office. But court records show the representative’s name was misspelled as “Jason Bean Baird” rather than “Jason Beau Baird,” making the case more difficult to locate in public searches.
The Tippecanoe County Prosecutor’s office did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about the misspelled name.

Lansing, where the State Capitol Building is located, is the backdrop to more than 700 red-tagged homes, meaning they have been deemed by the city as uninhabitable, Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) told lawmakers on the Senate Housing and Human Services Committee last week. Residents are being forced from their homes, bearing the financial burden of finding new rentals or short-term hotel stays due to issues that could have been resolved if their landlord had acted, Anthony added.
“We’re here because we all know and we hear about Michigan’s housing crisis, and we’re hitting a critical point,” Anthony said. “And whether you live in a rural township, a city or neighborhood, families across our state are struggling to find and keep safe, affordable and quality places to live.”
Senate Bills 19 and 20 of the Tenant Empowerment Package seek to mandate property owners respond to notifications from their lessees of defective conditions on the premises of their residence within 48 hours. If the property owner does not commence repairs to the issue posing a hazard to residents, under the legislation, renters could withhold rent or get the issue repaired and deduct the repair from the rent.
Michigan’s housing stock is old and in critical need of repair if families are going to have healthy and affordable housing opportunities in the state, Julie Cassidy, Michigan League for Public Policy’s senior policy analyst, told lawmakers at the committee meeting.
Research from the University of Michigan and the Michigan State Housing Development Authority last year found that 61% of Michigan’s housing units were constructed prior to 1980, around the time lead-based paint was banned in homes as it posed health risks, most of all for children. Additionally, the 2024 Michigan State Housing Needs assessment, also collaborated on by the two entities, determined there are more than 1 million renter-occupied units in Michigan.
Too many residents in Michigan live in homes with serious health and safety issues that require timely response from landlords, but those issues are not being addressed, Cassidy said.
“Many landlords do operate with ethics and care for their tenants, but the law must be strengthened to empower families whose landlords don’t meet their legal obligation to maintain basic standards of health and safety,” Cassidy said.
There needs to be a shift in how Michigan thinks and addresses the needs of renters, MI Rent Is Too Damn High Coalition Coordinator, William Lawrence said.

Despite societal perceptions of renters, many tenants would like to view the places they rent as homes, Lawrence said. That means homes where they can raise a family, establish their career and invest in the community.
The inability to access repairs or perform them themselves leaves tenants feeling “trapped” and distances them from investing in areas that don’t feel like home, Lawrence said.
“When one is empowered to make necessary repairs to improve your surroundings, it deepens your commitment to that place. It deepens your commitment to the neighborhood,” Lawrence said. “And when tenants are allowed to take responsibility for the places they live, the property owners at that property and in the neighborhood also benefit and our city’s benefit because the right to repair goes a long way towards abating the pink and red tag crisis, which is so severe here in Lansing, and other communities around the state.”
Other bills in the package aim to empower tenants in other ways, Anthony told lawmakers last week.
Senate Bill  21 would require that if a landlord offers lease renewal to a current tenant and plans on increasing the rent, the landlord would have to alert the tenant to the increase at least 90 days before the end of the lease.
Senate Bill 22 would allow landlords to return security deposits to tenants electronically as opposed to a check.
While Erika Farley, executive director for the Rental Property Owners Association of Michigan, said they support Senate Bill 22 for providing electronic options renters may prefer over paper checks, the association opposes the rest of the package.
However, Farley thanked Anthony for including the association in talks surrounding the bills.
“We as an association support that all the properties, these are homes for people, this is where they live, that they’re being kept up and they’re being taken care of in the way that they’re supposed to,” Farley said. “At this time, we are opposed, but we are continuing to work with the sponsor and thank her for her help.”
The package of bills is scheduled to be back before the committee on Tuesday.

This voting location is one of the most popular in the county. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)In American politics, money talks — and usually wins. Candidates fundraise to hire staff, print literature, and reach voters. More often than not, the candidate who raises the most money comes out on top.  
While money speaks volumes in elections, most campaign cash comes from a tiny sliver of Americans. In 2024, just 1% of Americans contributed at least $200 to federal candidates. Those donations accounted for a staggering 80% of all money in federal races. These donors are not representative of the American electorate. They’re overwhelmingly white, wealthy, and predominantly male.  
Money is a problem in local elections, too. When we started researching local elections in Seattle, we found that a tiny sliver of the electorate was funding political campaigns. In fact, in 2013, only 1.49% of Seattle residents donated to a local campaign. Those donors were concentrated in the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods.  
Seattle’s Democracy Voucher Program changed that.  
By giving every voter publicly funded democracy vouchers to support candidates of their choice, the program has brought tens of thousands more people into the political process. Today, the donors in local elections look much more like the voters of Seattle.  
As the program has expanded, participation has surged. The share of registered voters contributing to campaigns nearly doubled — from about 5% in 2017, when voters first began using their vouchers to support city council candidates, to nearly 10% in 2021, when voters could also, for the first time, use their vouchers to support mayoral candidates. Seattle now boasts one of the highest local contributor rates in the country. 
These new donors also reflect the city’s diversity. Democracy voucher users are far more representative — by race, income, and age — than traditional cash donors. To take just one example: in 2013, less than 1% of people of color in Seattle donated to city campaigns. By 2021, with voucher users in the mix, that figure had jumped to 8%. As democracy vouchers draw more people into the system of campaign finance, the program is narrowing the racial and economic disparities that have long distorted our elections and their outcomes. 
Seattle’s success hasn’t gone unnoticed. In 2022, Oakland voters passed a “Democracy Dollars” measure modeled on Seattle’s. And reformers in cities like Los Angeles and San Diego are watching closely as they explore public financing programs of their own. 
 As Seattle heads into its fifth election cycle with democracy vouchers, and voters consider renewing the program’s tax levy, the evidence is clear. The program has moved Seattle toward a fairer, more inclusive democracy. 
We hope Seattle chooses to keep leading the way.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0186-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The historically high surplus Missouri has enjoyed for the past six years will be nearly depleted at the end of the coming fiscal year, state budget director Dan Haug warned lawmakers during a committee hearing last week.
For several years, the state has budgeted billions more from the general revenue fund than current taxes were generating. The extra money has come from a surplus accumulated from double-digit growth in tax collections during 2021 and 2022 and substituting federal COVID-19 relief funds for general revenue, generating savings.
When Gov. Mike Kehoe unveiled his budget plan in January, the unobligated general revenue balance at the end of the coming fiscal year was projected to be $1.4 billion. Five months later, that estimate has been slashed in half.
Now, Haug said, the unobligated reserve will be $600 million to $700 million.
“The times are going to be getting tougher as we go forward, and so I think we would like to try to limit general revenue spending so that we are able to craft responsible budgets,” Haug said last week to the Senate Appropriations Committee.
Lawmakers are meeting in special session to consider Kehoe’s plan to set aside nearly $1.5 billion in future tax revenue to finance new or renovated stadiums for the Kansas City Royals and Chiefs. To win passage in the Missouri Senate, Kehoe agreed to add $125 million in general revenue to a spending bill.
Missouri governor allows more spending, property tax cap as he pursues stadium deal

That addition would reduce Haug’s projection for the June 30, 2026 balance to $500 million to $600 million, the lowest since June 2020.
Haug declined to respond to questions from The Independent explaining what changed to lower the projected balance. The top leaders of the House Budget Committee, which will hold a hearing Tuesday on the special session spending bill, said they had not heard the latest forecast and will ask Haug to explain it.
“I’ll need to ask him about that and have him walk me through what that projection is,” said Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel. “There is a real, legitimate concern around long-term fiscal sustainability, and we’ve got to be mindful of that.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle of Springfield, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said she’s getting pressure from members who want to add spending that failed when a construction spending bill was spiked before a final House vote.
“In order to make decisions about the economic future of Missouri, we need to have all the facts in front of us,” Fogle said.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Lincoln Hough, a Republican from Springfield, said he disagrees with Haug’s estimate, which he said is too low.
“They’re taking a more pessimistic approach to their calculation than is warranted,” Hough said.
 Surplus history

The peak for reserve cash was nearly $8 billion at the end of fiscal 2023, including funds that could be spent like general revenue. For comparison, the lowest recent end-of-year balance was $5.1 million on hand at the end of fiscal 2017.
With the avalanche of cash, the state embarked on several major projects unthinkable just a few years earlier. General revenue made up half of the $2.8 billion allocated for widening Interstate 70. Another $600 million was set aside to fund a major expansion of the Capitol Building.
There were new general-revenue funded buildings on every public college campus, a new state health lab and a new $300 million mental hospital in Kansas City. 
The state employee pension system received $500 million to help its long-term outlook and state workers are enjoying pay raises totaling 21% over the past three years, with another raise of up to 10% coming for long-term workers.
Lawmakers have also taken advantage of the surplus to fund local priorities. The trend began in 2022 with a few dozen items, and accelerated in each of the last three years with about 275 new earmarks added in 2023 and another 280 in 2024.
Former Gov. Mike Parson used a line-item veto to cut many of the items added by lawmakers, but most remained in place.
The budget on Kehoe’s desk includes 250 new earmarked items, using $417.7 million in general revenue.
During the regular session, before the new, lowered surplus projection, Deaton warned that this may be the last year for dipping into the surplus for local needs.
“We’re still in a good position, but certainly those opportunities are diminishing,” he said. “And if it’s not next year, it’ll be the year after that.”
When Kehoe took over in January, the outlook was that the general revenue surplus would be $2.5 billion when the fiscal year ends on June 30, with another $1.4 billion in other funds that can be spent like general revenue.
The budget before Kehoe uses $1.1 billion of those other funds.
The special session spending bill began with $50 million in general revenue. Kehoe agreed to add $125 million, for two items: $100 million for St. Louis tornado recovery and $25 million for a new research reactor at the University of Missouri.
The funds for tornado recovery and the reactor were items demanded by Senate Democratic lawmakers as the price for supporting — or at least not filibustering — the stadium bill.
Democrats in the House, who provided the decisive votes in favor of the stadium financing plan during the regular session, will meet to decide if they will also ask for favors, Fogle said.
The earmarked items in the spiked construction bill is a place to start, she said.
“There were vitally important investments in that bill,” Fogle said.
There may be little room for negotiation, she noted.
“There’s some truth to the fact that there’s an assumption that the House is going to pass the bill, the stadium bill specifically, considering we already have,” Fogle said.
The Republican majority will not seek additions to the spending bill, Deaton said.
“I’ve certainly had members talk to me and basically inquire as if there would be an opportunity, or if there was the possibility of things to be added, as you would expect,” Deaton said. “I certainly won’t be dropping any kind of a House committee substitute or adding anything.”
 Financial future

Haug’s warning of a disappearing surplus came despite positive trends in state tax collections, a growing total balance in the general revenue fund and a budget before Kehoe that spent $119 million less in general revenue than the governor requested in January.
After running below the previous year for 11 months, revenues have turned sharply positive. If the year-to-date growth rate reported Friday continued to the end of the month, the state would collect about $300 million more than was forecast in December for the full fiscal year.
And with modest growth projected for the coming year, the higher-than-expected revenue would carry over into a reset of the basic assumption for tax collections.
The negative factors that will lower tax collections include a tax cut approved by lawmakers, expected to reduce revenue by about $250 million in the coming year, and federal tax changes, currently expected to cost the treasury at least $170 million.
The federal budget bill being considered by the U.S. Senate also has the potential to impose large new costs on the state, up to $400 million annually to continue the SNAP food benefits program and unknown amounts due to changes in federal support for Medicaid.
The state will be limited in its ability to launch new programs in the future, Haug said last week.
“We feel like we need to sort of get back to basics on general revenue spending,” he said.
Future budgets will be tight because the state will need to pay those new costs and continue the programs it has already begun with surplus funds, Deaton said.
“It’s one thing to be able to do it this year, but can you do it next year?” Deaton said. “Can you do it the year after that, obviously, is the big open question. We will see what tax revenues do or don’t do, but we’re definitely on somewhat of a perilous path.”
Hough, however, said he sees no reason to hold money just to maintain a large balance. 
“I try to take what would be a more realistic approach,” Hough said. “Everybody always talks about taxation as theft. Well, if we’re going to steal your money, we ought to invest it in your communities on the things that matter to you and support you.”

Other proposed constitutional amendments to require the popular election of the secretary of state (LD 147) and attorney general (LD 149) were rejected by the majority of both chambers.
With papers frantically shuffling between chambers this week ahead of the planned June 18 adjournment, Maine Morning Star will highlight the biggest items of debate as well as legislation and issues that we’ve followed all session.
Here’s an overview of what happened Monday. 
Both chambers
Both chambers have now passed a resolve (LD 470) directing the Department of Education to review teacher mentoring programs in Maine Public Schools after the House voted Monday to pass an amended version of the bill.
Following the Senate last week, the House voted 81-64 to pass LD 1145, which would give a group of mobile home owners or a mobile home owners’ association the right of first refusal to purchase a mobile home park if the owner intends to sell. The House also adopted a floor amendment stripping the emergency clause from the bill that was also approved by the Senate. (More on this issue here.)
The House and Senate have both also passed LD 13, which establishes a fund for the Secretary of State’s Office for the production and delivery of election-related materials. 
The Senate backed two measures previously supported by the House that would expand access to needle exchange programs (LD 1078) and fund proper disposal of syringe litter (LD 1738). (More on this here.)
Both chambers voted Monday against legislation (LD 1505) that would phase out the sales and use tax, as well as another bill (LD 1899) that would have eliminated taxes on health care spending, which tax committee co-chair Sen. Nicole Grohowski (D-Hancock) said she generally supported but the bill was “not ready for prime time.”
The House voted 74-71 for LD 1113, which asks a court, when sentencing an individual for a Class A, Class B or Class C crime, to consider the age of the individual at the time of the conduct. The Senate later followed, voting 19-15 to pass the measure.
A proposal (LD 1036) to prohibit landlords from refusing to rent to tenants solely because they rely on programs such as General Assistance or housing vouchers is essentially dead after both chambers insisted on their respective positions on the bill. After it was initially passed by the House last week, the Senate rejected the bill after Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) explained that the Judiciary Committee is carrying a similar bill into the next session to allow more time to work on it. (More on this bill here.)
Before the Senate passed LD 1522 without a roll call, the House voted 76-68 to permanently establish the Maine Eviction Prevention Program within the Maine State Housing Authority.
Members of both chambers rejected a measure (LD 152) that would have amended the Freedom of Access Act to require agencies to respond to public records requests within a specific time. 
Both the House and Senate rejected a bill (LD 1593) that would require that, when making a decision based on advancing equity, that a state or a local government agency make public its definition of the term as well as metrics.
Both chambers also voted down a so-called parents rights bill (LD 1974), which would explicitly declare it a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing, education and care of their child.
Both chambers have also now rejected legislation (LD 1707) that would require an individual to be a citizen of the U.S. in order to receive any state or local assistance, aside from education. It would also have required municipalities to comply with federal immigration authorities in order to receive general assistance or state-municipal revenue sharing. 
Non-concurrent matters
LD 613, a bill supported by the Maine Medical Association that allows terminally ill patients to waive the current 17-day waiting period for access to life-ending medication, is in limbo after the Senate voted 17-18 on Monday against passage of the measure, which won the backing of the House last week.
The House Monday again voted against passage of LD 1263 after the Senate last week backed the measure, which would create a Class A crime for aggravated trafficking of fentanyl when it results in an overdose. It now goes back to the Senate to take up again.
After a failed effort to align with the Senate’s rejection of LD 1535, the House insisted on passage of the bill, which would require the Public Utilities Commission to gather a group of municipal, police and fire officials to discuss the high electricity usage related to illegal cannabis grows in the state. Since the Senate last week insisted on its position against the bill, it is now essentially dead.
The chambers are split over a resolve (LD 1364) directing the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife to evaluate efforts to promote the use of non-lead ammunition with the House passing an amended version of the bill that the Senate rejected. During the Senate debate, Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said she is consistently approached by constituents seeking to ban lead-based ammunition but said they’ve never done that because educating people about this topic gets them to choose a better option. The amended version of the bill, she explained, would make educational materials more accessible.
After passage in the Senate last week, the House voted 76-69 to reject LD 371, which would remove the 100-megawatt maximum capacity limit for hydropower to qualify as a renewable resource under the state’s renewable resource portfolio requirement. (More on this issue here.)
After LD 1928 squeaked through both chambers last week, the Senate voted 14-20 against enactment on Monday leaving the bill, which would prohibit lodging establishments from using single-use plastic containers — such as mini shampoo bottles — in limbo. 
Senate action
The Senate on Monday voted under the hammer to pass legislation (LD 1202) to create the African American Studies Advisory Council to measure and monitor the implementation of related curriculum using data collected by the Department of Education. It is an amended version of legislation that passed last year but was never enacted. (More on this here).    
House action
House lawmakers voted 100-44 to back legislation (LD 297) that extends provisions of current law regarding the management of wastewater treatment plant sludge at the state-owned landfill.
The House voted against legislation (LD 1268) that would have provided an annual stipend to all employees of the Maine State Ferry Service.
Legislation (LD 1471) requiring a landlord to provide tenants an energy efficiency disclosure statement for certain rental housing in the state passed the House.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Another potential riot at the Milwaukee County Jail was quelled by guards in April, Wisconsin Examiner has learned through open records requests. On April 12, correctional officers were notified of a “mass refusal,” with jail residents refusing to enter their cells. One occupant was placed on administrative segregation for attempting to incite a riot, according to emails obtained by Wisconsin Examiner. 
This marks the second known instance this year that unrest has occurred within the jail. Emails sent by Sgt. Tiawana Thompson indicate that at about 12:30 pm on April 12, Officer Brenden Zollicoffer radioed the jail’s master control to report the mass refusal. According to the email exchange, Thompson arrived with Officer Billy Howled and saw that additional Milwaukee County Sheriff Office (MCSO) personnel were already responding to POD 5D, where the refusal was occurring. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“I noticed occupants either running to their cells, laying down, or standing at their cells,” Thompson wrote in the email, adding that personnel advised that occupant Corey Kirkwood had “incited a riot by closing all cell doors not allowing inmates to get into their cells.” Kirkwood, who was charged in January with sexual assault and trafficking of a minor, was one of several jail residents who appear to have been transferred to other parts of the facility after the April unrest. 
Thompson’s email also reported that “due to this action, occupant Kirkwood will be placed on administrative segregation (Ad-seg), pending discipline as well as being an ongoing investigation.” Another officer was tasked with completing a rules violation report, the email stated.
The Milwaukee sheriff did not respond to questions about the incident and whether Kirkwood remains in administrative segregation, or how he was able to control whether cell doors were open or closed. 
Ten days after the mass refusal, MCSO Correctional Captain Kerry Turner emailed Sgt. Thompson and asked whether paperwork for those moved to administrative segregation had been finished. Turner asked, “Also, have all violations been completed and signed off on by a supervisor? Have the occupants all received a copy of their violation? Please let me know the status of these concerns of mine.” 
It’s unclear what triggered this particular mass refusal incident. Another potential riot was quelled by jail staff in mid-February after one jail occupant, 49-year-old Keenan Brown, allegedly attempted to incite a riot by “shouting to the entire housing unit that the inmates needed to stick up for themselves and that they would not be taken seriously until they started assaulting staff.” Jail staff had learned that Brown used his jail-issued tablet to contact his mother, urging her to reach out to Fox6. When jail staff talked to Brown, he said jail residents weren’t being let out of their cells enough, and that their rights were being violated. At least 20 people were transferred to other parts of the jail after that incident as well. 
During the late summer of 2023, nearly 30 jail residents were charged with disorderly conduct after they barricaded themselves in a library area and refused to return to their cells. The mass action was done to protest “dissatisfaction with their gymnasium time coming to an end and expressing that, generally, they wanted more ‘open’ recreational time,” according to an MCSO press release issued weeks after the unrest occurred. 
The jail has come under increasing scrutiny under multiple sheriffs in recent years. Over a 14-month period from 2022 to 2023, six people died in custody at the jail. In late May, 33-year-old Gabriel Muniz-Jimenez became the second person to die in 2025.  A third party audit detected severe problems with the physical condition of the jail’s booking areas, housing units, use of force policies and practices for monitoring people placed on suicide watch. A recent review by the auditor, the Texas-based company Creative Corrections, found the jail to be in compliance with 71.2% of  proposed corrective actions, with another 28.8% being in partial compliance.

The online poll conducted by the D.C.-based Hart Research Associates between March 21 and March 28 got feedback from 605 registered voters in Wisconsin as a way of understanding perspectives on abortion in the state. Planned Parenthood is facing the possibility of being cut off from Medicaid funds under Donald Trump and House Republicans’ budget reconciliation package and Wisconsin  Republicans recently reaffirmed their commitment to enforcing a strict statewide abortion ban. 
The poll found that 45% of voters are “base supporters” of abortion, meaning they personally support the right to abortion and believe it should be legal, while 34% were “soft supporters” meaning they are personally against abortion but oppose government restrictions. 
Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in a statement that the poll confirms the “overwhelming” support across the state for abortion care access and for Planned Parenthood. 
“That Wisconsin Republicans in Congress, in the State Legislature and in their own political party platform continue to endorse policies and enact cuts to essential care despite broad support from their constituents is devastating,” Atkinson said. “These cuts mean Wisconsinites will lose access to birth control, wellness visits, STI tests and cancer screenings. This isn’t just about abortion — it’s about whether people can count on the care they need, when they need it.” 
About 69% of survey participants reported a “favorable” view of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin.
Lucy Ripp, communications director for A Better Wisconsin Together Institute, said in a statement that the poll shows that Planned Parenthood is “a healthcare provider that Wisconsinites overwhelmingly support and rely on for quality healthcare access.”
The poll found that 74% of voters think abortion is at risk nationally and 71% said it is at risk on a statewide level. 
Wisconsin Republicans approved a resolution at their state convention in May that calls for the enforcement of a criminal 1849 law, which effectively banned abortion in the state following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022. A Dane County judge ruled that the law doesn’t apply to abortion, though the decision was appealed and is currently before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.
Democrats, meanwhile, have introduced a proposal that would repeal the 1849 law as well as an array of other laws on the books in Wisconsin that restrict abortion access, including a state-mandated requirement that patients have two appointments before an abortion, a requirement that doctors must provide a state-mandated booklet that contains medically inaccurate information, an ultrasound requirement and a law that stops physician assistants, nurse practitioners and APRNs from performing abortions.
The bill would also repeal state laws that prohibit coverage of abortion care under insurance plans for public employees, plans on the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace for Wisconsin and under BadgerCare. Federal law also bans the use of federal money for abortion with exceptions in the case that a pregnancy endangers the life of a pregnant person or is the result of rape or incest. 
The poll also found that 78% of voters support protecting health care professionals from criminal charges related to providing abortion care, that 72% of voters favor allowing advanced health care providers like nurse practitioners and midwives to provide abortion care, 70% favor funding for health care clinics that provide abortion care and 68% favor Medicaid and Badgercare coverage for abortion care.
Atkinson stood alongside Wisconsin Democrats to introduce the bill in May, saying it was the “next step in protecting and securing full reproductive freedom for people in Wisconsin.” 
The bill has not progressed in the Republican-led Legislature, though the authors of the bill Rep. Lisa Subeck (D-Madison) and Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) have said they plan to continue to advocate for better abortion access in the state, even if it has to wait until next session. 
“This legislation is about making a future here in Wisconsin, where everyone has access to the health care in need, where every single person has the ability to thrive. This is legislation that Wisconsinites broadly support, that Americans broadly support,” Roys said. “[The] only people who don’t broadly support it are the Republican politicians who have gerrymandered themselves away from any voter accountability that is coming to an end. We will be getting a hearing on this bill if it’s not this session, it will be next session back — mark my words.” 
Democrats in Wisconsin and nationally have used abortion as a motivator in elections since 2022, including in key state Supreme Court elections and in competitive state legislative races. State Democrats are aiming to win a trifecta in 2026 and need to flip the Assembly and Senate to do so — a goal that could be within their reach under the legislative maps put in place last year. The last time Democrats held majorities in the state Legislature was during the 2009-2010 legislative session 
The survey also asked participants about their electoral preferences, finding that 62% of respondents  said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who supports guaranteeing legal abortion while 57% said they would vote against a candidate who wants to make abortion illegal.  
The poll also found that 70% of voters would support a referendum that guarantees the legal right to an abortion in Wisconsin if it appeared on ballots. It also found that 81% of voters support passing legislation to conduct a statewide referendum on abortion. 
Wisconsin does not have a voter-led ballot initiative process. There is a process to allow voters to decide whether to ratify a law through a referendum, but under that, it would need to be passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers. Democrats and Republicans have at times expressed support for placing a question about abortion on the ballot — both advisory and binding — though neither has agreed on the details.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma’s attorney general is pushing back on a congressional effort to bar states from regulating artificial intelligence for the next decade.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond is one of a bipartisan coalition of 40 attorneys general who signed a letter from the National Association of Attorneys General in opposition to an amendment in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that bans state action on the issue.
Drummond signed the letter opposing the Republican-led bill because there is no proposed federal regulatory framework to regulate artificial intelligence, said Leslie Berger, his spokesperson. 
“Congress should not preclude states from enacting laws on the subject unless Congress itself enacts its own laws,” Berger said in a statement.
“The impact of such a broad moratorium would be sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI,” according to the letter.
States have passed their own regulations to address the harms associated with artificial intelligence such as prohibitions against AI-generated explicit materials, data privacy and protections for renters against using algorithms to establish rent, according to the letter. 
Oklahoma lawmakers have also launched efforts to regulate the growing use of artificial intelligence.
House Bill 3453 attempts to define artificial intelligence and requires that Oklahomans be informed when they are interacting with AI. The bill passed out of the Oklahoma House, but stalled in the Senate. 
Lawmakers proposed other measures tackling AI usage include prohibiting spreading information using deepfake media within 90 days of an election and health care insurance providers, which would require insurers to disclose the use of AI based algorithms in their review process. They did not advance through the Senate.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)WEISER — In late May, Ashley Lynn responded to her first call.
She drove over to the local sheriff’s office, helped a man call 988 — the Idaho crisis and suicide hotline — and stayed with him until more help arrived.
A paramedic for 20 years, Lynn is leading a new program in rural Washington County that’s meant to help steer people experiencing mental health issues or searching for help for others toward the best resources. 
And, hopefully, free up resources for ambulances and law enforcement.
“The two worst places for someone in crisis to go is the hospital and jail,” Lynn said, repeating what she’d heard in crisis intervention training. “Currently, that’s our only option.”
Southwest District Health launched the Washington County community paramedic program this year — calling it the first of its kind. While it’s in its early stages and might evolve, some other rural Idaho counties are already wondering how they can do something similar.
“My vision for this program is to be able to bypass those destinations” — jail and the hospital — and “get someone right into whatever service is going to best serve their needs,” Lynn told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. So, “they’re not accruing emergency room or ambulance bills. They’re not occupying a seat unnecessarily in the jail, and they’re actually getting help and maybe changing the trajectory to where they can get better.”

 With only one staffed ambulance daily, Weiser paramedics are tight on time

Idaho has a shortage of emergency medical services, or EMS, which is a largely volunteer workforce and isn’t required to be funded by the state, Idaho Reports reported. 
For the past two decades, Weiser Ambulance District has worked with the same operational budget, Lynn said.
Only one ambulance there is staffed with a paramedic daily. There is a backup crew, she said, but “we don’t have extra resources to go out and sit with someone who’s experiencing a crisis.”
“Washington County has a really small, although very professional and amazing, team of EMS folks,” said Wendy Young, who manages the federal grant funding the community paramedic program as a project coordinator at Southwest District Health. 
“So when somebody is out on one call, that means the next person that’s calling, the next person that’s in crisis — whether it’s a health care or a behavioral health crisis — they might not get the response time that they would appreciate,” she added.
 



 How to get mental health help: text or call 988

If you, or someone you care about, need help with thoughts about suicide or self harm, or emotional distress, mental health or substance abuse issues, trauma or abuse, you can contact the Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline at 988.
The 988 number is available by text and call — 24/7, every day of the year. Online chats are also available at https://idahocrisis.org/. 
The hotline can also dispatch a mobile response team of behavioral health professionals for in-person support. Teams are available from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Mountain time, but will be expanded to 24/7 service on July 1, the Idaho Crisis and Suicide Hotline’s website says. 
 



 ‘If we need to sit with someone for an hour, that’s what we’re able to do’

For now, the Washington County program is referral-based. 
Lynn’s first call came from a local domestic violence-focused group. But as a paramedic, Lynn can pivot to people’s needs on calls. 
She started by doing a basic medical screening and making sure the person was safe, she said. Then she called the crisis hotline, 988, and stayed until the mobile crisis team arrived. 
For calls, Lynn uses an unmarked, “everyday looking” old county vehicle — not a full ambulance. 
“Not every situation ends in transport or needing to go somewhere. But if we’re able to stay with that person, deescalate the situation and hopefully resolve what’s going on to some degree, and keep them where they’re comfortable and safe,” she said.
But paramedics on the behavioral health program crew aren’t bound by the same time constraints as typical paramedics, who might need to head to another emergency call, she said. 
“If we need to sit with someone for an hour, that’s what we’re able to do,” Lynn said.  
  Weiser only has one staffed ambulance a day, and another backup crew. That leaves resources stretched thin to stay with someone in crisis, says paramedic Ashley Lynn. (Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)
In EMS, burnout is high. But Lynn also hopes the program can show paramedics other career paths. 
“My hope is that I can show that paramedics can do more than just cruise around in an ambulance and show up to bad calls and do paramedic things — that we have a lot to offer the health community,” she said. 
The program is funded by a five-year grant from the federal government agency called the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said Young, with Southwest District Health.
The grant funds “need to be used to divert people away from 911 or higher levels of care such as emergency rooms when such diversion is appropriate,” she said.
The grant is in its second year, with the first year largely spent on administrative tasks to set up the program. 
In other areas with community paramedic programs, local organizations, law enforcement and even hospitals sometimes pitch in funds. 
 Ada County, Nampa Police have other first responder mental health programs 

About an hour away in Ada County, the community paramedic program helps law enforcement, EMS and firefighters with calls. 
Last year, the program responded to nearly 1,200 calls for mental health crises, substance use or other needs, Ada County Paramedics Public Information Officer Ryan Larrondo told the Sun in an email. That work included steering people toward the community crisis center, inpatient psychiatric facilities and referrals to other resources.

But the program also helps with patients’ non-emergency needs, receiving nearly 200 referrals from local first responders last year for people who need health resources that aren’t mental health related, he added. 
In Nampa, the police department is starting a program to send a social worker out to calls with a police officer — similar to programs in local law enforcement agencies in Ada County, like at the Boise Police Department. 
The hope is to reduce mental health holds and avoid arrests, said Nampa Police Department Deputy Chief Curt Shankel.
“Becuase that’s really a no-win, right? They’re not getting the help they need there long term,” he told the Sun in a phone interview. “So we want to be able to divert that. And hopefully be in a place where we aren’t getting law enforcement called as much to the same individuals, or getting to the point where we end up having to make an arrest.”

(Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)[Election 2025 Voter Guide: Eleven candidates are running in the June 10 Democratic and GOP gubernatorial primaries.]It’s primary day in New Jersey.
The Garden State’s voters will select which candidates will face off in November, when term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy’s seat and all 80 seats in the Legislature’s lower chamber come up for a vote.
This year’s contests have seen a swell of candidacies. Six Democrats and five Republicans are seeking their parties’ nods for governor, and more candidates are seeking seats in the Assembly than at any point since 1993.
On the Republican side, contractor Justin Barbera, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, ex-Englewood Cliffs Mayor Mario Kranjac, and longtime radio host Bill Spadea hope to flip the governorship after eight years of Democratic rule.
The Democratic contest includes Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, teachers union president Sean Spiller, and ex-state Sen. Steve Sweeney. They are hoping to win a third consecutive gubernatorial term for their party for the first time since Gov. Richard Hughes succeeded Gov. Robert Meyner more than half a century ago.
Polls have shown Sherrill and Ciattarelli leading their respective races, though public surveys of both contests have been rare, and the sheer number of candidates makes the results unpredictable, particularly on the Democratic side.
Twenty-five of the state’s 40 legislative districts will play host to intraparty challenges Tuesday. Most of those come on the Democratic side and from candidates recruited by and aligned with Fulop, though Republicans face primaries in some districts too.
It’s likely some sitting lawmakers will see their tenures ended by Tuesday’s results.
In the 31st District, Assemblyman William Sampson (D-Hudson) and Hudson County Commissioner Jerry Walker face Assemblywoman Barbara McCann Stamato (D-Hudson) and Bayonne Councilwoman Jacqueline Weimmer, who are running under Fulop’s slogan.

Detroit’s population grew in 2024 for the second year in a row. This is a remarkable comeback after decades of population decline in the Motor City.
What explains the turnaround? One factor may be Detroit’s efforts to attract and settle immigrants.
These efforts continue despite a dramatic national shift in tone toward new arrivals. This includes executive orders from the second Trump administration targeting immigrant communities, international students and their universities, and cities in which immigrants live.
We study urban geography and immigrant integration. Despite these federal policy shifts, our own research and that of others has found that local leaders in cities across the U.S. are actively working to bring immigrants in and help them become part of local communities, generally for economic reasons.
Our recent publications on immigrant integration and immigrant community engagement show how and why cities adapt to changes in their population and economies.
Detroit and other former immigrant gateway metro areas such as Buffalo, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and St. Louis, Missouri experienced significant immigration in the early 20th century. These population booms were followed by a period of decline in immigration numbers.
Now these cities are using branding strategies to construct inclusive identities designed to attract and retain immigrants. It may be surprising to think of a city branding itself, but local governments often work with private nonprofits to shape and manage their city’s image. They try to build a unique and desirable identity for the city, differentiate it from competitors, and attract new businesses, residents and tourists this way.
Here are three reasons why Detroit and other cities want to welcome immigrants:
 1. Encouraging economic growth and attracting talent

Immigration has a positive impact on the economy, research shows.
Local leaders in Detroit recognize that in a global economy, a thriving industrial sector and robust labor market are linked to the contributions of immigrant communities. They also understand that the growth of these communities brings positive economic ripple effects.
Immigrants are more likely than the general population to own their own businesses. Organizations such as Global Detroit encourage entrepreneurship through programs such as the Global Talent Retention Initiative, Global Talent Accelerator and Global Entrepreneur in Residence and provide resources for small businesses.
Immigrants also fill labor needs, from high-tech fields such as engineering and research to manual labor sectors such as construction and food service.
The City of Detroit Office of Immigrant Affairs promotes economic development and immigrant integration through education, English as a second language programs, economic empowerment and community resources.
These efforts are paying off by attracting immigrants to the city.
This economic impact extends to tourism as well. The region’s marketing campaigns embracing diversity shape how visitors perceive the region. The Detroit Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau spotlights the unique experiences the city’s diverse neighborhoods offer to tourists.
 2. Enhancing community and regional resilience

Regional resilience describes a region’s ability to withstand and adapt to challenges such as economic shocks and natural disasters. Cities like Detroit that are still trying to bounce back from deindustrialization know from experience how critical this is.
Immigration contributes to regional resilience, research shows. In addition to supporting local economies and strengthening the labor force, the arrival of immigrants in Detroit has helped offset native-born population decline, stabilizing the overall population and bolstering local tax bases.
According to our analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn metro area grew by 1.2%, from a total population of 4,291,843 in 2010 to 4,342,304 in 2023.
According to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, the Detroit metro area’s native-born population decreased by 58,693 people during that 13-year period, while the foreign-born population increased by 109,154. The top five countries of origin for immigrants in the metro area are India, Iraq, Mexico, Yemen and Lebanon.

From 2023 to 2024, the metro area’s population gained 40,347 immigrants and lost 11,626 native born residents – resulting in a population gain of 28,721.
Efforts to welcome immigrants in Detroit and its surrounding communities contributed to this trend of immigrant population growth offsetting overall population decline.
 3. Promoting social cohesion and enhanced civic engagement

Successful place brands are rooted in inclusion and a strong civil society. Detroit’s rich tapestry of cultures in areas such as Dearborn and Hamtramck creates a vibrant regional identity.
Organizations such as Global Detroit’s Welcoming Michigan actively support local grassroots efforts to build mutual respect and ensure that immigrants are able to participate fully in the social, civic and economic fabric of their hometowns.
Examples include Global Detroit’s Social Cohesion Initiative, Common Bond and Opportunity Neighborhoods. These initiatives help bring neighborhood residents of various backgrounds together to share their cultures, support each other’s small businesses and socialize. Such programs strengthen the region’s democratic foundations and enhance its appeal as a welcoming and inclusive place to live.
 Forging a way forward

Detroit has found that welcoming immigrants and integrating them into the life of the city is one way to navigate the economic, political and cultural challenges it faces.
And it is not alone in embracing this strategy. Other cities practicing similar strategies include Baltimore; Boise, Idaho; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; Dayton, Ohio; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans; Pittsburgh; Roanoke, Virginia; and Salt Lake City.
Although not all cities choose to pursue such strategies, in those that do, local leaders signal a region ready for a globalized future.

It goes far beyond that, according to Mabel Dobbs, the executive director.
“It has become my ministry,” she says.
She’s right. Angel Wings Network is doing the Lord’s work, without a sermon, a choir and congregation.
Idaho is telling health insurers to prepare for new enhanced breast cancer screening law

“I’m 83 years old and I know of people who retire, sit down, do nothing and get old,” she says. “This (Angel Wings Network) has become so much a part of my life. The cool thing is that my board of directors are just as committed as I am. It’s gratifying that we do what we do with people who are all volunteers.”
Angel Wings provides services for cancer patients, mostly transporting them to and from treatment appointments throughout the region. The “angels” in this case are the 15 volunteer drivers who give up untold hours to be with patients.
One of those drivers, Eleonore Huggins, who has been driving for about 10 years – traveling somewhere around 100,000 miles over that time. But that’s not the downside of her volunteer job.
“I’ve lost a lot of friends,” she says, wiping away tears over her sadder stories. But she brightens up when talking about the friendships she has made.
“It’s very rewarding – extremely rewarding,” says Huggins, a member of the Payette Lions Club. “They don’t cry about their condition, and they are very positive. It makes you think about how incidental personal problems can be. For instance, I don’t grow my fingernails well. How stupid is it to think about that when people have no eyebrows, no breasts or no hair.”
But with Huggins, and other drivers, conversing with the patients is one of the best aspects of the job.
“We can talk differently with them, and it’s not all about their condition. They always are so grateful,” she says. “I’ve been a real estate agent, I’ve rodeoed, raced Dune Buggies and raced sailboats. I’ve been in construction and farming, so I’m well versed in just about any conversation that the person next to me wants to talk about.”
And she’s always up for grocery shopping, going to a show or dining with her client friends.
“With one of my good friends that I’ve lost, we went to every Mexican restaurant on the way home from treatment to find the best salsa … and we still hadn’t found it,” she said, chuckling.
Although the drivers don’t get paid, they are reimbursed for expenses. The network has raised thousands of dollars for gas and restaurant cards. So, drivers and patients can count on getting gas and at least one meal for every trip. Angel Wings also offers extensive “goody bags” to patients, including “prayer blankets.”
None of that happens through wishful thinking. As Dobbs says, “Without fundraising, nonprofits don’t work.” So, there are many “angels” in this community, and beyond, who recognize, and respond, to the needs of this nonprofit network.
Generally, Angel Wings serves people within 70 miles of Weiser … but angels don’t operate with those restrictions. Angel Wings is available for anyone who needs it from neighboring rural communities – and there’s no question about the need for the service in this peaceful rural area.
“There is a huge need,” Dobbs says. “You’d be absolutely astounded at the number of people who have no one and no family. We have become a lifeline in a lot of ways.”
Some of the patients may have family, or a spouse. But the spouse, for whatever reason, may not be able to drive or treatment times may conflict with working schedules of family members. In either scenario, Angel Wings comes to the rescue.
And one person who makes it all work is Kelli Banks, the “super angel” who coordinates driving schedules and who cheerfully fields calls – sometimes during the late hours at night. There’s no question about the value she brings.
“We have a large number of clients who would not be able to get treatment without a ride to get there,” she says.
Indeed, these angels do have their wings.

(Photo courtesy of Versant Power)Though initially divided, lawmakers decided to move forward with a proposal to modify the law born out of a 2021 referendum question requiring the Maine Legislature to approve any new high-impact transmission lines.
Although some legislators who worked on the campaign argued the proposal would clarify the law, LD 810 initially fell short of passage in the House of Representatives. After the Senate voted to pass the bill last Wednesday, the House ultimately decided to change course and passed the bill Monday by a one-vote margin.
“I’m shocked that we are being faced with this bill so soon after the historic and controversial battle,” said Rep. Elizabeth Caruso (R-Caratunk) during the House discussion last week. 
Caruso recounted the efforts by volunteers  to gather signatures for the referendum question and the overwhelming support from roughly 60% of voters. The ballot question drew passionate grassroots support and overcame over $60 million in opposition spending fueled mostly by international energy companies.
Therefore, the proposal before the Legislature to reform the law “opposes the will of the people and the vote,” Caruso said. Approving it would send a message to voters that citizens’ initiatives “are a joke,” she added. 
Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) said she was one of those Mainers who stood outside L.L. Bean to collect signatures for the campaign and was proud to vote ‘Yes.’ Though she still supports that referendum, Sachs also backed LD 810 because it “is clarifying, not repealing.” 
Rep. Chris Kessler (D-South Portland), who sponsored LD 810, said he was also among the voters who supported the referendum, but argued his bill is meant to clean up the unintended consequences of the new law. 
Sen. Nicole Grohoski (D-Hancock), who worked on the referendum campaign, said while it is important to offer constituents legislative approval as a backstop on transmission lines proposed by private corporations, the current statute creates higher scrutiny for lines proposed by the Legislature than those from the private corporations.  
More specifically, the bill seeks to clarify that when the Legislature is seeking to develop a new transmission line, that project should not need to come back to the Legislature for approval after the Public Utilities Commission’s review process. 
During committee hearings, the Office of Public Advocate, Maine State Chamber of Commerce and multiple environmental organizations agreed the duplicative process can deter developers, drive up costs for ratepayers and stand in the way of meeting climate goals.
However, Sen. Matt Harrington (R-York) argued in favor of the current model because it gives the Legislature another opportunity to weigh in on a line after a route has been determined. This could be important because constituents could have issues with a line’s route that wouldn’t be known at the time of initial approval.

Ford,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/06/10/16-states-sue-to-block-trump-administration-plan-to-distribute-machine-gun-conversion-devices/,The lawsuit says Trump's plan would expose residents to greater amounts of deadly violence and is contrary to federal law.,"New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin is among 16 attorneys general suing the Trump administration over its plan to redistribute thousands of devices that convert guns to machine guns. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Attorneys general in 16 jurisdictions sued Monday to block a Trump administration plan to redistribute thousands of devices that convert guns to machine guns, including distribution in states where such devices are banned by state law.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland, says the plan would not only expose residents of those states to greater amounts of deadly violence, but it would be contrary to federal law that calls for the seizure of machine-gun conversion devices. And it would cause federal officials to “aid and abet violations of state law” by distributing the devices in states where they are outlawed, the suit says.
The decision to return almost 12,000 forced reset triggers — which allow shooters to fire hundreds of rounds a minute with one pull of the trigger — was announced in a settlement last month between the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and gun manufacturers and gun-rights groups.
“These devices enable firearms to fire up to 900 bullets per minute. The increased rate of fire allows carnage and chaos to reign on the streets,” said Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) in a virtual press briefing Monday with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin (D) and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings (D).
“Everyone nearby becomes vulnerable to serious injury or death. These are battlefield weapons that have no place in our communities,” Brown said.
Under the Biden administration, ATF classified forced reset triggers as “prohibited machine guns under federal law … and conducted extensive retrieval operations, seizing nearly 12,000 FRTs from the field,” according to the lawsuit.
But the new administration reversed course after a Feb. 7 executive order from President Donald Trump (R) on “Protecting Second Amendment Rights.”
On May 16, the Justice Department announced a settlement with Rare Breed Triggers, a manufacturer of the devices based in Wichita City, Texas. Under the deal, the company agreed not to develop or design such triggers for handguns, to promote safe and responsible use of its products, and to enforce its patents to “prevent infringement that could threaten public safety.”
In exchange, the government agreed not to enforce any policy where an FRT is “contended to be” a machine gun, and to return by Sept. 30 any reset triggers seized or “taken as a result of a voluntary surrender.”
“We won,” Lawrence DeMonico, president of Rare Breed Triggers, said in a video posted online the day settlement was announced. “With the Trump administration’s renewed focused on justice and their commitment to correcting the weaponization of the DOJ under the Biden administration, we were finally able to secure a deal that brought this fight to a close.”
Representatives with Rare Breed Triggers and the Justice Department did not respond to email requests for comment Monday.
The National Association of Gun Rights, which was also a party to the settlement, said it a statement that the deal will survive any challenge from the “anti-gun attorneys general.”
“A federal court already ruled the government unlawfully seized thousands of legal triggers from law-abiding Americans — a decision that the ATF now acknowledges and accepts,” said Hannah Hill, vice president for the association. “These states lack standing to file this lawsuit, and they know it. This suit is just reckless political lawfare.”
But the states’ lawsuit highlights the impact of gun violence in their jurisdictions, where it said there were nearly 47,000 gun-related deaths in 2023. Illinois had the most such deaths that year, at 1,691. Of the states represented at Mondays briefing, Maryland recorded 737 gun-related deaths in 2023, New Jersey had 430 and Delaware had 124, according to the suit.
The suit also spells out the financial burden that comes with gun violence, for medical bills, police, court and prison costs. It says one fatal shooting in Baltimore can cost $2.4 million and a nonfatal shooting costs $1.5 million. In Newark, New Jersey, the cost is nearly $2.2 million for a fatal shooting and $1 million for a nonfatal shooting.

“This is not a partisan issue. It is a public safety issue,” Delaware’s Jennings said. “The Trump administration’s deal to redistribute these deadly devices violates the law, full stop. It undermines public safety and ties the hand of law enforcement.”

Platkin recalled the shooting death in March 2022, just two months after he took office, of SeQuoya Bacon-Jones, who was a bystander to a shooting when she was struck and killed. Platkin said SeQuoya would have celebrated her 13th birthday last Saturday.
“She had dreamed of becoming a law enforcement officer, but instead she was killed by a single stray bullet while she was playing hide-and-seek in the courtyard of her apartment complex,” Platkin said. “I wish the Trump administration … would put little kids like Sequoya’s interests ahead of the gun lobby’s. But since they don’t seem to care, we’re going to make them care.”
Besides Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey, other jurisdictions on the suit are the District of Columbia and the states of Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. All but Maine and Vermont currently have state laws prohibiting forced reset triggers or guns modified with them.

(Official headshot)Hannah Pingree officially launched her campaign for governor after months of speculation about the candidacy of the former Mills administration official and speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
Pingree, the daughter of U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree, will join at least three other Democratic candidates facing off in the gubernatorial primary next June, including Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, former Senate President Troy Jackson and Angus King III, the son of independent U.S. Sen. Angus King.
She kicked off the campaign with several planned stops around the state on Tuesday, starting with a rally in Rockland, scheduled meetings with local leaders in Lewiston and Biddeford before capping off the day with a celebration in Portland.
Pingree left her role as head of Gov. Janet Mills’ Office of Policy Innovation and the Future, also known as GOPIF, which she held since 2019. The office was created to recommend policy solutions for some of the state’s biggest issues including climate change, housing, workforce development, the opioid crisis and more.
Under Pingree’s leadership, GOPIF helped advance legislation that created the Maine Climate Council to support the state in meeting its greenhouse gas emission reduction goals while investing in local infrastructure. Pingree served as co-chair of the council, which authored the state’s climate action plan that outlines strategies for electrifying transportation and home heating, among other initiatives.
When Pingree stepped down from that role, Mills said in a statement, “She and her team … have exceeded my expectations at every step, and I look forward to watching her do great things for Maine in the years to come.”
In her campaign announcement, Pingree said her vision for Maine’s future was “rooted in economic opportunity, climate resilience, affordable housing and health care, and strong, connected communities.”
Before working in the Mills administration, Pingree served four terms in the Maine Legislature including two years as speaker of the state House of Representatives. 
In a poll released last week by Pan Atlantic Research, Pingree came in third among likely Democratic voters, with 20% percent of respondents saying they would likely support her, and another 39% saying they would consider supporting the congresswoman’s daughter, though at the time she had not yet officially announced a run.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee officials are resuming the search for a mental health facility site to replace Moccasin Bend after dropping consideration of an Eastdale site in Chattanooga.
The state Department of General Services removed the site from contention last week shortly before Democratic state Rep. Yusuf Hakeem was to hold a town hall to hear concerns about putting the mental health institute in an area of his House District 28.
Hakeem opposed the site for a combination of reasons, including the impact of a mental health facility on people’s properties, poor communication from the state and access by a two-lane road with no sidewalks. The 150-acre tract is bordered by a train track and quarry too.
“It’s like they want to push it in my district,” Hakeem said, adding he and the community were “ready to fight.”
Hakeem said several other locations such as one near Erlanger Hospital and one on Amnicola Highway should be considered.
The state might still be looking at two other pieces of property near Eastdale, but Hakeem does not oppose those.
Tennessee Building Commission approves new Moccasin Bend Mental Health facility minus the site

Department of General Services spokesperson Michelle Parks confirmed Monday the state is evaluating multiple sites in Hamilton County. She added that state law prevents the department from discussing sites under consideration.
State Sen. Bo Watson, a Hixson Republican, said the state has looked at about 50 sites in Southeast Tennessee and will continue the search. At least 15 acres are needed for the hospital.
Watson said the state “never really evaluated” the Eastdale site because it was tied up with a development request through the local planning commission, then changed hands.
“Given the pushback and the concerns that the neighbors had, we never really got a chance to discuss it to any degree,” Watson said.
No public hearings were held on the property, he added. 
The state built the mental health institute at Moccasin Bend along the Tennessee River in 1961 and planned to expand it there until advocates called for the area to be preserved as much as possible because of its Native American history. The area is the site of a national archeological district and part of Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park.
The state had approved a Moccasin Bend expansion in 2023, but Gov. Bill Lee called for another location for the mental health facility because of the archeological review.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Federal prosecutors on Monday detailed legal arguments for the detention until trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration.
Abrego Garcia was returned to Nashville from El Salvador on Friday to face two criminal human smuggling charges tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. 
He appeared briefly in a downtown Nashville courtroom late Friday, and is scheduled to return to court this Friday for a formal arraignment of the charges against him. 
That hearing will also consider a motion by the Justice Department to keep Abrego Garcia in custody until the date of his trial, which has not yet been set.
A federal grand jury indictment issued under seal May 21 and made public June 6 charges Abrego Garcia with “conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported to El Salvador prison, to face federal charges in Nashville

Abrego Garcia “knowingly and unlawfully transported thousands of undocumented aliens” for profit between 2016 and 2025 as a member of the MS-13 gang, prosecutors said. 
Dumaka Shabazz, a federal public defender appointed to represent Garcia in the criminal case, declined comment on the charges Monday. 
“At this date, we are not inclined to give a statement,” Shabazz said via email.
The criminal charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Putnam County by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, court records show.
Abrego Garcia was driving an SUV with nine Hispanic men when he was pulled over for speeding on Interstate 40 in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville, court records said. He was not charged in the incident.
Prosecutors now allege that further investigation revealed the stop involved Abrego Garcia smuggling migrants within the United States illegally. 
Abrego Garcia faces a potentially lengthy sentence: a maximum of 10 years in prison for each person he allegedly transported.
‘A stain on the Constitution’: Abrego Garcia lawyers refuse to drop his case against U.S.

A resident of Maryland until a prior traffic stop on March 12 this year, Abrego Garcia was dispatched within days to an El Salvador prison along with scores of other detainees. 
An immigrant from El Salvador, Abrego Garcia had received an immigration court order in 2019 that allowed him to reside in the United States and specifically barred the federal government from deporting him to El Salvador, where, he said, he feared gang violence.
The prosecutors’ memo seeking Abrego Garcia’s detention until trial, filed in federal court Monday, alleges there is a “serious risk” that Abrego Garcia “and/or persons acting on his behalf will obstruct justice and/or intimidate the witnesses against him” should he be released from federal custody pending his trial.
They also argued Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and a danger to the community. 
In their memo, prosecutors said they plan to raise allegations that children without legal immigration status were transported and “used in unsafe ways” to avoid detection of Abrego Garcia’s illegal smuggling activities. 
Abrego Garcia has not been charged with crimes involving the illegal transport of children. 
Prosecutors also acknowledged that, should Abrego Garcia be released pending trial, he would likely be immediately taken into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to face further proceedings in immigration court.

A list of “sanctuary” jurisdictions accused of failing to cooperate with immigration arrests, including the state of Colorado, was taken down after protests about its accuracy. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A list of 14 states, 298 counties and 200 cities deemed immigration sanctuaries by the Trump administration has disappeared from a government website but continues to hang over the heads of officials who face threats of losing federal funding.
“We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause,” said Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, North Carolina, a heavily Democratic county that nevertheless complies with a new state law requiring cooperation with immigration arrests.
“The list is gone. Am I satisfied that it was rectified? Yes. Am I satisfied that it’s over? No,” Blackwood said.
The list went up May 29. It called out the “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The White House had already threatened “suspension or termination” of federal funds to them.
Along with counties and cities, the list named the whole states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia as “state sanctuary” areas.

There was immediate reaction from some areas, not only Democratic states and counties with court-tested legal policies of declining cooperation with deportation, but also conservative areas mystified by their inclusion.
“We figure it must be some kind of mix-up. We certainly support our fellow law enforcement agencies,” said James Davel, administrative coordinator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, which was included despite no apparent immigration sanctuary policy. The county voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 by more than 67%.
One possible explanation: The county board passed a resolution in 2021 declaring Shawano a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” as a sign of “vigorous support of the peoples’ Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.”
The list disappeared from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website in a matter of days, after the National Sheriffs’ Association complained that many counties were erroneously included.
“It was quite the debacle,” said sheriffs’ association spokesperson Patrick Royal. “We are working with the administration to resolve as much as we can.”
But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a television appearance that the list would come back and was largely accurate.
“That list is absolutely continuing to be used and it is going to be identifying those cities and those jurisdictions that aren’t honoring law and justice,” Noem said in a Fox News interview June 1.
Courts have so far upheld local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration arrests. California won a lawsuit on the issue in 2017 under the first Trump administration, and the same federal judge issued an injunction saying federal funds couldn’t be withheld on the basis of immigration cooperation during a new trial on the issue.
The national sheriffs’ association president, Sheriff Kieran Donahue of Canyon County, Idaho, said in a May 31 statement that the list “was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation.” He said it was “an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.” Canyon County was not on the list, though the city of Boise was.
The pushback from sheriffs was a sign of how seriously flawed the list was, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
“The real problem is, how are they defining sanctuary?” Putzel-Kavanaugh said. “To have pushback from an association that is typically quite supportive of this administration and their agenda points to problems with definition.”
Watauga County, North Carolina, was on the list when it first appeared May 29 but came off before it was taken down. The county’s congressional representative, Republican Virginia Foxx, said in a Facebook post that she intervened.
In the post, Foxx called it “a mistake … made during the Biden administration that resulted in Watauga County being listed incorrectly as a sanctuary county.” She also said that “Watauga County is no longer listed” after she “contacted DHS.”
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group favoring less immigration, said her list of sanctuary jurisdictions included Watauga based on a June 2024 report from U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement listing it as among hundreds of others as “non-cooperative institutions.”
Vaughan said data she requested from ICE shows some counties in North Carolina were still not complying with all detainers this year through early February, but Watauga is not one of them.
“They should probably come off the list,” she said. “None of those sheriffs has contacted me about reviewing their policies or taking them off the map. I would be happy to do so, and have done so frequently with sheriffs in other states.”
Sheriff Len Hagaman of Watauga County told Stateline via email that he had contacted federal immigration officials and confirmed that his county, which voted Democratic for president last year by a 52% to 46% margin, had a solid record of cooperating with immigration arrests.
Hagaman alluded to an April Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, calling out Watauga and eight other North Carolina counties as immigration sanctuaries.
“For several weeks now, I, along with other North Carolina sheriffs have had to endure gross and inaccurate misinformation regarding false allegations,” Hagaman wrote.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)North Dakota is being sued over a new law that requires drug manufacturers to sell more of their medications at a discount.
House Bill 1473, signed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong in April, primarily affects drug companies participating in a federal program called 340B.
A drug manufacturer has filed suit over the policy in North Dakota federal court, claiming it is unconstitutional and will hurt its profits. The state denies the company’s claims.
The 340B program was created by Congress in 1992 to improve health care access in low-income communities. It requires participating drug companies to offer discounted products to qualifying hospitals and other medical facilities. Drug companies must take part in 340B in order to participate in federal Medicaid and Medicare programs.
In legislative hearings, proponents of the bill called 340B a critical program for rural North Dakota, subsidizing medication for patients and allowing hospitals to provide a wider range of services.

“This is a lifeblood to rural facilities across the state,” Rep. Jon Nelson, a Rugby Republican and bill sponsor, said during a February committee meeting.
North Dakota this year became one of a handful of states to pass a law limiting drug manufacturers’ freedom to decide where and how they sell 340B drugs.
House Bill 1473 makes it a class B misdemeanor for companies to adopt policies that “deny, restrict, prohibit, or otherwise interfere” with pharmacies’ ability to obtain and dispense products to patients on behalf of 340B hospitals. 
In testimony on the proposal, hospital representatives complained that drug companies were cutting off access to medications subsidized through 340B, namely by refusing to sell the drugs to more than one pharmacy hospitals work with.
In an April complaint filed against North Dakota, drug company AbbVie argued that Congress intended for manufacturers to be able to set additional requirements for 340B hospitals to access their products — so long as the medications are offered at the reduced costs mandated by the program.
The company alleges that pharmacies and hospitals are taking advantage of the 340B program by selling the discounted medications at full price. Barring drug manufacturers from placing additional parameters on these sales will only harm the low-income patients the program is intended to benefit, AbbVie wrote in its complaint.
In testimony in favor of House Bill 1473, hospital and pharmacy representatives said that the real reason drug companies are reluctant to sell discounted drugs to more pharmacies is because they want to sell their medication at list price at as many places as possible.
AbbVie also alleges that North Dakota is trying to use a state law to change a federal program, which they say is a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause. Any changes to how 340B operates must be approved by Congress, the company argues. 
They claim that federal law makes the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services the sole agency in charge of enforcing 340B compliance, leaving no room for state policies like House Bill 1473.
The company further argues that the law is an illegal attempt to regulate business in other states. Since some North Dakota hospitals have agreements with pharmacies across state lines, House Bill 1473 could affect transactions between out-of-state drug companies and pharmacies — which AbbVie says is unconstitutional.
According to the company, the law also violates rights protected under the Fifth Amendment by forcing it to sell its property to a private party.
Companies found in violation of the new law, which takes effect Aug. 1, could face 30 days in jail, a maximum fine of $1,500, or both. The North Dakota Board of Pharmacy can also impose civil penalties on violators, according to testimony on the bill.
AbbVie has asked a federal judge to declare House Bill 1473 unconstitutional and to order that North Dakota cannot enforce it.

Courts across the country have ruled differently on this issue. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and Third Circuit Court of Appeals have both ruled the 340B program does not prevent drug companies from imposing additional requirements on hospitals and pharmacies, the drug manufacturer noted in court filings.
However, the Eighth Circuit in 2024 upheld an Arkansas law similar to House Bill 1473. The Arkansas law makes it illegal for drug companies to prevent hospitals from using pharmacies to get 340B drugs into the hands of patients.
The Eighth Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and Arkansas.

Jeff Landry’s cabinet says the number doesn’t take into account certain factors.
At the request of state lawmakers, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor reviewed staffing levels at the state’s nine regional child welfare offices under the Department of Children and Family Services. Its review involved employee counts in fiscal year 2024, which ended June 30 last year. The calculations used staff-to-case ratios for the various programs and cases the agency handles.
The audit report counted 1,541 child welfare workers statewide in fiscal year 2024, when DCFS served approximately 4,400 children in foster care per month, conducted 21,901 child protection investigations and spent $327.5 million. 
Turnover rates for state child welfare workers declined slightly, from nearly 16% in fiscal year 2023 to 15.3% in fiscal year 2024. In both years, an average of 214 child welfare employees left DCFS, while from July 1, 2024, through March 26, 2025, just 151 departed the agency.

Louisiana, like many other states, has struggled to hire and retain qualified child welfare workers because of the nature and difficulty of the job and its low salary, according to the audit report.
The audit report lists “standard/goal” ratios for each DCFS child welfare program, ranging from 1:10 for child protective services workers and foster care staff to 1:600 for adoption and guardianship subsidy program employees. It used those ratios to determine the staffing needs at the nine regional child welfare offices.
The greatest need for additional child welfare staffing was in the Alexandria region, which was 31 workers short of the 150 needed. The Covington office needed 27 workers to reach 206, and Thibodaux was 20 short of its optimal 143 staff count.
In his response to the findings, DCFS Secretary David Matlock said the auditor’s ratios did not factor in new hires, who aren’t immediately given a full caseload, and staff on extended leave, whose caseloads are transferred to other workers.     
“In addition, caseloads vary in complexity including the severity of the allegations, family size and dynamics, and geographic location, impacting the time required for each case,” Matlock wrote to Legislative Auditor Mike Waguespack in his response to the report’s findings.
The audit also examined how many regional staffers were assigned more than 10 new child protective services (CPS) cases per month in fiscal years 2024 and 2025. It found the rate decreased year over year at every office but one: Alexandria, where 24% of its staff were given more than 10 new cases in both years.
Other offices had higher rates of 10-plus new CPS case workloads, including Lake Charles (35%), Covington (32%), Shreveport (29%), New Orleans (29%), Lafayette (27%) and Thibodaux (26%).   
According to the audit, DCFS follows Child Welfare League of America caseload standards, which state that workers who conduct initial child protective assessments and provide related services should have no more than 10 “active ongoing families” assigned to them. 
From July 1, 2024, through Jan. 31, 2025, Louisiana CPS workers averaged nearly 16 active cases, and some had far larger caseloads – including 39 with more than 100 cases in a given month.
The audit highlighted the heaviest CPS caseload in each region over the timeframe and found one worker in Alexandria had 344 active cases over a month’s time. 

The statewide backlog of CPS cases declined 20% from July 1, 2022, through Feb. 3, 2025, when the count was 2,463, according to the audit. Cases are considered backlogged if investigations take longer than 60 days.
On a regional basis, CPS case backlogs increased in Alexandria, where there has been an average of 495 delinquent cases per week in fiscal year 2025 (66% increase) and Lafayette (108 cases, 12% increase).
To tackle the growing backlog in Alexandria, the audit report said DCFS has formed a special interview team to expedite staff hiring and added permanent and temporary CPS staff positions.
“Despite ongoing challenges, DCFS remains committed to strengthening its frontline workforce,” Matlock said in his audit response. “The Department continues to explore strategies for effectively managing child welfare caseloads and workloads, with the goal of improving staff retention and increasing positive outcomes for children and families.”

(NASA photo)(This article was updated at 2:07 p.m., Tuesday, June 10, 2025, to clarify a statement attributed to Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program project manager Joshua Horton.)
Former GOP gubernatorial nominee and state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin) has introduced legislation seeking to ban conceptual geoengineering techniques he falsely links to the “chemtrail” conspiracy theory. 
In a pitch for his bill, Mastriano associated the theoretical techniques aimed at combatting climate change have been falsely associated with the baseless conspiracy theory that some condensation trails, or contrails, left by high-flying aircraft are being used to introduce toxic substances into the atmosphere.
The “Clean Air Preservation Act” would outlaw “solar radiation modification or sunlight reflection methods” in Pennsylvania and impose strict penalties on violators. Sen. Camera Bartolotta (R-Washington) is a cosponsor of the bill.
Joshua Horton, project manager at the Harvard Solar Geoengineering Research Program, told the Capital-Star that research behind solar geoengineering aims to identify ways to mitigate climate change by reflecting sunlight back into space. Modeling evidence suggests it would cause little harm and the small amount of outdoor field research already conducted has not harmed the environment, he said.
  State Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Franklin). (Photo by Amanda Berg for the Capital-Star).
“To be clear, there is no geoengineering going on. There’s no solar radiation modification going on,” Horton said. “So to the extent that this bill is premised on the belief that it’s happening, it’s just factually incorrect.”
In a memo in December seeking support for the bill, Mastriano said the “release of unknown, experimental, and potentially hazardous substances into the atmosphere without the consent of the people of Pennsylvania is a clear violation of Article 1, Section 27 of the PA Constitution.” He has previously proposed similar legislation.
Mastriano’s memo also cited a 2023 White House report on potential future solar geoengineering research, falsely claiming it proves the federal government “may conduct solar radiation modification or geoengineering experiments involving the release of air contaminants into the atmosphere, and those activities may occur within the Commonwealth.”
That report “focused on potential research and its governance, not authorizing any deployment or specific activities,” according to Michael Thompson, managing director at the nonprofit Alliance for Just Deliberation on Solar Engineering. “The report explicitly aimed to guide how research could be approached and managed, emphasizing transparency and risk assessment, and to reduce the risk that research is perceived as a step towards inevitable deployment.”
Thompson’s organization seeks to promote “just and inclusive deliberation” on the research and possible future employment of solar geoengineering. He told the Capital-Star that controversy surrounding the theoretical practice is “amplified when state-level discussions wrongly link scientific inquiry into solar geoengineering with debunked ‘chemtrail’ hoaxes.”
“For solar geoengineering, public concern is understandable,” Thompson said. “People rightly want to know what is being researched and would be alarmed by pollutants being added to the skies for nefarious reasons, but that’s just not happening.”
A spokesperson for Mastriano did not respond to requests for comment. 
On May 31, Mastriano held a virtual roundtable to rally support for the bill, which is awaiting consideration in the Senate Agriculture & Rural Affairs committee. 
Jolie Diane, who runs a website called Zero Geoengineering, called in from California to give a presentation riddled with falsehoods on “weather modification policy and the governance of geoengineering experimentation.”
Diane has a history of lobbying state legislatures to ban solar geoengineering. She does not hold any scientific credentials, despite Mastriano calling her a “leading expert in weather modification.” 
During the roundtable, which garnered thousands of views across social media platforms, Mastriano rallied against theoretical methods such as stratospheric aerosol injection.
Horton explained that stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, is a conceptual solar geoengineering method that would involve aircraft introducing aerosols into the upper atmosphere to “reflect a small fraction of incoming sunlight back to space.” 
“It’s pretty simple technology, but it doesn’t exist yet. It’s been explored almost exclusively through computer models,” he said. “The research tends to show it would produce net benefits globally.”
Mastriano also spoke against cloud seeding, a common practice employed for decades to increase rainfall that would be banned under the bill. A 1967 state law already requires anyone who wants to try cloud seeding to apply for a license from the state Department of Agriculture. 
No one has ever applied for this license, nor has the state’s agriculture department ever investigated unauthorized cloud seeding, press secretary Shannon Powers said in an email. 
While cloud seeding is not practiced in Pennsylvania, “there are … cloud seeding weather modification activities that have been ongoing for 75 years, and involve putting silver iodide in clouds to enhance rainfall,” Horton said. “A lot of small counties all over the west, and places beyond the U.S., pay for services for pilots to go up there and spray this stuff.”
Mastriano and Diane both alluded to the debunked “chemtrail” conspiracy theory, which alleges that nefarious actors are spraying toxic substances into the atmosphere via contrails created by high-flying aircraft. He claimed that normal contrails should dissipate within minutes, falsely suggesting that if contrails are visible for longer, it’s an indication they are infused with toxic substances. 
According to the National Weather Service, contrails form as hot, moist air from an aircraft’s engine mixes with freezing outside air. That moisture condenses and forms a contrail, which can be visible for hours depending on factors like humidity and wind. 
“These clouds are not part of a global conspiracy,” Thompson said. “Lawmakers know better than this and should do minimal homework before bringing bills to their legislative bodies.”
Mastriano has a history of sharing “chemtrail” misinformation. In a November 2022 Facebook post, he shared a photo of contrails with the caption, “I have legislation to stop this … Normal contrails dissolve / evaporate within 30-90 seconds.”
“When these bills appear, given there is no active nefarious geoengineering taking place
… one has to assume they are brought forward primarily for political reasons, rather than a  misunderstanding of the facts,” Thompson said. 
“We worry that these kinds of politically motivated legislative efforts, by fostering confusion and fear, make such nuanced and forward-looking consideration far less possible.”
Similar legislation restricting solar geoengineering has been proposed in more than two dozen states. Tennessee lawmakers passed a law banning the practice last year. 
“We are concerned generally that legislation aimed at governing or banning non-existent activities, such as non-existent chemtrails, disempowers and distracts rather than enabling citizens to engage with decisions being made now that will impact them in the future,” Thompson said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/contrails-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Patrick Morrisey on Monday announced an “overhaul” of the state’s Department of Transportation, saying years of financial mismanagement and outsized investment in new projects instead of maintaining existing infrastructure has left the agency broke.","Gov. Patrick Morrisey announces an overhaul of the state Department of Transportation at an event in Bridgeport Monday. (Screen grab of Morrisey's Youtube channel)Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Monday announced an “overhaul” of the state’s Department of Transportation, saying years of financial mismanagement and outsized investment in new projects instead of maintaining existing infrastructure has left the agency broke.
The new “culture change” at DOT will include refocusing existing resources toward “long overdue” deferred maintenance of the state’s bridges and roads, reducing administrative overhead costs by cutting unspecified positions with “too high [of] salaries” and increasing transparency regarding details of the agency’s ongoing projects.
“We’re getting rid of the bureaucracy. We’re going to put more money in the roads and the bridges,” Morrisey said. “That’s what the people want. That’s what the people deserve.”
According to the Federal Highway Administration, as of 2024 West Virginia holds the second highest rate of bridges in the nation ranked in “poor” condition. Per an analysis of that data, more than 18% of the state’s bridges are in “poor” condition while 56% are considered to be “fair” and 25% are classified as being in “good” condition. 
Between 2020 and 2023, West Virginia had the highest percentage of bridges in poor condition of any state. In 2024 — the most recent year with data on record — Iowa outpaced West Virginia with 19% of its bridges considered to be in poor condition.
Though he cited different data from unnamed sources, Morrisey said Monday he wants to see the state get its rate of bridges in poor condition below 10% by 2028.
Bridge conditions are determined federally by a formula analyzing different components of a bridge, including paving, cracks, structural performance, average usage and any reported damage. Bridges that score lower than four with the formula are considered “poor,” those between four and seven are “fair” and bridges scoring higher than a seven are in “good” condition, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
Todd Rumbaugh, the state’s transportation secretary, said the condition of the state’s bridges as well as its roads — of which at least one third are considered to be “deteriorated,” according to a report earlier this year — are only going to worsen in coming years.
That’s due to a lack of investment in maintenance, Rumbaugh said. As those needs increase, he continued, so do safety risks for everyone in the communities that rely on them.
“Deferred maintenance does not go away. It gets more expensive, it gets more dangerous over time,” Rumbaugh said. “That’s why we must shift the focus and resources towards preserving what we already have.”
Morrisey says Justice responsible for outsized debts on road infrastructure
In what has become a trend for Morrisey over his first six months in office, the new governor said several of the overarching challenges for the state’s transportation infrastructure were spurred by policy decisions he inherited.
Though he didn’t mention him by name, Morrisey’s speech Monday came with several not-so-subtle barbs against his predecessor, former Gov. Jim Justice. 
Justice, who now represents the state as a Republican in the U.S. Senate, made West Virginia’s road infrastructure a core tenet during his eight years as governor. From 2017 to 2024, Justice started and oversaw the “Roads to Prosperity” project, which had billions of dollars put into road projects through increased registration fees, taxes and more to pay for general obligation bonds for the projects.
Morrisey said Monday, however, that he believes the money was largely misspent and didn’t account for the actual needs of existing infrastructure. It was so bad, he continued, that the federal government told his administration “very early on” that unless the state changed how it managed its highway system, there would be a cut to federal funds.
Federal funds are crucial for state road and bridge projects.
“Basically, the state was spending so much on some of the new highways without a clear plan for getting them done,” Morrisey said. “A basic look at our financial numbers made it obvious that we can’t even afford a lot of existing highways that were on the books.”
While the bonds purchased by the state for Roads to Prosperity were 30 year bonds, Morrisey said “every little bit” of those funds were allocated in the first seven years they existed.
When he took office in January, Morrisey said he was “alarmed” to learn that the Department of Transportation was “basically out of money.”
“I’m here to tell you that the Roads to Prosperity money — it’s all gone. It’s done. It’s not available into the future because it’s effectively committed,” Morrisey said.
And while the money is gone, debt for those bonds is hanging over the state while numerous projects remain incomplete and other needs are growing. Morrisey said that the state’s highway system is “responsible for $909 in highway debt for every person in the state of West Virginia.” Most other states, he continued, have transportation debts between $500-$600 per a person.
Now, he said, West Virginia will focus on a more “data-driven” approach that balances investments with immediate need. While most of the state’s funds will be going toward much needed infrastructure maintenance and improvements, the state will start to look at partnerships — with localities as well as public private partnerships — to start new roads projects where necessary.
The changes, according to Morrisey, will be large but they represent what he sees as a reflection of his administration’s priorities, especially when compared to Justice’s.
“We’re just not going to let political decisions guide this anymore … Too many of our leaders in the past wanted to kick the can down the road. They want to settle future generations with so much debt,” Morrisey said. “I want to be clear: under our administration, we want to pay our bills on time and not just push them way off into the future to be inherited by a new governor.”

“It is no secret that Frankfort, for whatever reason, is hyper-concerned with the going-ons of Louisville. Doesn’t always make sense to most of us, but it is a reality,” said Lyndon Pryor, the president and CEO of the Louisville Urban League, a civil rights organization. “Whoever the new superintendent was going to be, was going to have to go out and be able to build relationships with legislators in Frankfort.”
Besides educating the most students — 94,000-plus — Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) also is one of Kentucky’s most racially and ethnically diverse districts.
In the current political climate, Yearwood and other Louisville educators face an especially narrow and slippery path — between meeting the needs of their diverse student population and satisfying anti-diversity mandates from the Trump administration and possibly Republicans in Frankfort.
Statewide just 11% of students in Kentucky public schools are Black and 10% are Hispanic or Latino. More than 70% are white.
In Jefferson County, Black and white students each account for a little over a third of the enrollment in public schools. Hispanic or Latino students make up 19% and Asian students about 5%. About 6% are students of two or more races, according to Kentucky Department of Education data from 2023-24. About 21% of JCPS students are multilingual. 
Louisville is also a high-poverty district. About 65% of students in the public schools are economically disadvantaged, slightly higher than the 61% statewide. Students are classified as economically disadvantaged based on eligibility for free or reduced-price meals. By contrast, in neighboring Oldham County, where many residents commute to jobs in Louisville, just 24% of students are economically disadvantaged and fewer than 3% are Black, according to state data.
‘ … need to be forced’
One Republican lawmaker, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, is already anticipating a fight with the Louisville district over her plans for banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) in Kentucky’s public schools.

The legislature banned DEI from Kentucky’s public universities and colleges earlier this year. Tichenor’s bill to end DEI in K-12 schools did not get a committee hearing in the 2025 session but she plans to introduce it again next year. 
Tichenor, who represents Oldham and Trimble counties and part of northern Jefferson County, pointed to recent refusals by Jefferson County Public Schools and Fayette County Public Schools in Lexington to sign a form from the U.S. Department of Education to certify their compliance with the Trump administration’s anti-DEI interpretations of civil rights law. Superintendents of Jefferson and Fayette instead provided documents saying they are in compliance with federal and state laws. 
Said Tichenor: “The fact that the board has also said they will not change course on DEI tells us they they need to be forced to stop these practices because they’re discriminatory, they’re unconstitutional, they’re against the Civil Rights Act, and we need to focus on equal opportunities for our students, and anything outside of that that’s contrary, that’s discriminatory, needs to stop.”
Tichenor said the district’s academic performance also points to the need for change. “We’ve seen that across JCPS, their focus on DEI over the decades has not improved educational outcomes for their students,” Tichenor said. “It just hasn’t. More of the same will get more of the same results.”
According to KDE data from 2023-24, a smaller share of JCPS students than those statewide scored proficient or distinguished on state academic assessments. Among third-graders, 36% of Jefferson County students scored proficient in reading compared with 47% statewide. Among eighth-graders, 24% of Jefferson County students were proficient in math compared with 37% statewide.
Will schools have full array of teaching tools?
  Rep. Tina Bojanowski (LRC Public Information)
Meanwhile, a Democratic lawmaker from Louisville said she hopes Yearwood and the district will challenge Republican efforts to uproot DEI programs from public schools. “We need to do whatever we can to help every student be successful,” said Rep. Tina Bojanowski, who is also a teacher in the school district. She is concerned that some of the tools to provide that help may become illegal — ultimately impacting student success. 
“What is the end goal? Is it to take away any additional supports that a certain group of students end up needing?” 
Bojanowski said the diversity and needs of Louisville students require a full array of teaching tools and resources.
 “We’ve got so many more kids in poverty, so many kids who’ve experienced trauma — are we going to have tools taken away that help us try to mitigate whatever concerns the kids have that then impact their ability to learn?” 
“We need to stay in the frame of what our ultimate goal is — to make the district the best district in the nation for every child who attends the district, including kids in poverty, including kids who’ve experienced trauma, including kids who walked 1,000 miles in order to come to the U.S. and are afraid their parents are going to be picked up and not home when they get home,” Bojanowski said. 
‘I will be in Frankfort’
The school district declined to make Yearwood available for an interview for this story. However, he has spoken publicly about how he would work with lawmakers while also protecting Louisville schools from attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion.
In a community forum on May 20, Yearwood said he would focus on asking lawmakers for support to build up the district’s academic success.

“They’ll be my best friend. I will be in Frankfort, knocking on the doors, talking, inviting (them) to breakfast, lunch, whatever it takes, so that they can understand the great things happening here in JCPS,” he said. 
Asked how he would protect DEI, Yearwood said he did not view education as “one size fits all” because students can have unique personalities and learning styles. 
“If you don’t have a diversity lens, if you don’t have equitable practices within your school district, then there will be the haves and the have nots,” he said. “And that’s not happening.” 
Yearwood moved to the United States when he was 17 years old. He was born in Scarborough, Trinidad and Tobago to parents who were both educators. 
“Success isn’t defined by where you start but how hard you are willing to work and how deeply you truly believe in your own potential,” he said in a recent district press release.
Yearwood, who was formerly the superintendent of Columbia Public Schools in Missouri, will replace Superintendent Marty Pollio starting July 1. Yearwood left the district after taking a separation agreement from the school board, which included a clause to not publicly criticize the school district. 
Current superintendent becoming community college president in Indiana
Pollio announced he planned to retire from JCPS in September in a letter to school district employees. In recent years, JCPS has seen increasing oversight from Republican lawmakers, including an interim session task force that focused on the governance of the school district. 
“Although there have been challenges over my tenure, no one can ever question my passion, fight, and love for Jefferson County Public Schools,” Pollio wrote at the time.

Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana said in April that Pollio would become the institution’s next president following his retirement from JCPS. 
Michael Frazier, the executive director of the Kentucky Student Rights Coalition who testified in favor of this year’s bill to eliminate DEI in higher education, told the Lantern that he viewed Yearwood’s answer on DEI to be “the same goal as the state.”
Frazier said the board’s choice to appoint Yearwood over Ben Shuldiner, superintendent of Lansing School District in Michigan, was “more intentional than what people are giving credit.” Frazier added that choosing Shuldiner would have been “intentionally antagonistic” to Frankfort. Shuldiner, when asked about DEI in his forum, fiercely defended such initiatives, saying that the key to having DEI is “making it part of everything you do so you actually can’t just get rid of it.” 
Surveys conducted by JCPS’ search firm and the Jefferson County Teachers Association found that community members and staff favored Shuldiner over Yearwood. 
Pryor, the Urban League leader, said that Yearwood has “to do everything that he can to protect” DEI initiatives and ultimately the desired educational outcomes. Otherwise, “he’s going to be deemed a failure by everybody.”
“He’s going to have to have to be innovative in this new world order,” Pryor said. “He’s going to have to be thoughtful and considerate. He’s going to have to be collaborative to make it happen because of these attacks. But it’s still doable, and it is a worthy and necessary cause for our kids and, quite frankly, for our community.”

Scott, of Louisville, speaks before the House of Delegates, his last time as president. (Screenshot)In his final address as president of the American Medical Association, Kentucky’s Dr. Bruce A. Scott called on the medical community to turn its “anger into action” to protect the medical safety net now under threat in Congress.  
Scott, an ear, nose and throat specialist from Louisville, closed out his term as president of the AMA by slamming insurance denials and Republican proposals in Congress that he said threaten the future of medicine. 
“The same House bill that brings us closer to finally tying future Medicare payment to the rising cost of running our practices also takes a step backwards by limiting access to care for millions of low income Americans,” Scott said. “Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act are literal lifelines for children and families for whom subsidized health coverage is the only real option.” 
He added: “We must do all we can to protect the safety net and continue to educate lawmakers on how best to target waste and fraud in a system without making it tougher for vulnerable populations to access care.” 
In late May, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the controversial spending and tax package, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump who supports the measure. Many health advocates are warning it will hurt hospitals and patients. The bill, which is now in the hands of the Senate, proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care. 
The AMA is working “to target the Senate as we work for improvements in this bill,” Scott said. 
He called for more legislative advocacy, saying that “the times call for some anger” but “we can channel that anger into positive action.” 
Among other things, Inside Higher Education reports that the bill could “entirely reshape the student loan system.” This, Scott said during his farewell address to the AMA House of Delegates Friday in Chicago, complicates the future for an already dwindling physician workforce. 
The proposed lending practices in the bill would make medical education “virtually unaffordable for many students,” he said, calling that “simply unconscionable.” Kentucky has a well-documented physician shortage. The Kentucky Medical Association reports that most counties don’t have enough primary care providers. 
“Our nation should be working to bring down the cost of medical education, not erecting barriers that defer brilliant young minds from pursuing this noble profession,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Scott said, “our patience is being tested by this new administration and Congress.”
“Despite all the efforts of everyone in this room and our colleagues across the country, our health care system is failing in fundamental ways. It’s failing physicians and, more importantly, it is failing our patients,” Scott said. “I’m angry because the dysfunction in health care today goes hand in hand with years of dysfunction in Congress. Physicians are bearing the brunt of a failed Medicare payment system, and while our pay has been cut 33% in 25 years, we see hospitals and even insurance companies receiving annual increases. Congress needs to know that there is no ‘care’ in Medicare if there are no doctors.” 
In addition to federal policy, Scott criticized insurance companies that deny doctor-recommended care. He said he recently had a patient with a large tumor pushing into her eye that he needed to remove surgically. Her insurance provider initially denied the procedure, recommending “an antibiotic and a steroid nasal spray” first. 
“Are you kidding me?” Scott said. “An antibiotic and a nasal spray to treat her tumor? Without seeing the patient, without talking to the patient, without completing even one single semester of medical school, this insurance representative determined that she knew more than the patient’s doctor.” 
Such denials lead to confusion and stress for patients, Scott said, and frustration for doctors that eventually “become too much to overcome” and force people to leave the profession. 
This, he said, is “a system that is undermining our judgment and eroding our patients’ trust.” 
“What insurance companies are doing to our patients is wrong,” Scott said. “Stepping between us and our patients is wrong. Denying necessary and even life saving care is just plain wrong.” 
Scott’s term as AMA president ends Tuesday. Michigan’s Dr. Bobby Mukkamala was elected as his successor last year.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.
Just below Greenland is a menacing stretch of water known as the Cold Blob. As the planet heats up, the Cold Blob remains a spooky outlier — positioned right above the area where the Atlantic Ocean’s so-called conveyor belt is supposed to switch back and head south.
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current, or AMOC for short, comprises an enormous system of currents that carries water and nutrients across the world and plays a large part in stabilizing the global climate. For years, scientists have warned that the AMOC was slowing down, possibly nearing collapse. The Cold Blob is the most immediately visible proof of its decline, likely a result of Greenland’s melting glaciers, but research on the deep water current’s strength over recent years has varied wildly.
New studies published in Nature Geoscience last week and in Nature earlier this year offer some slightly encouraging news. AMOC’s decline could be “much more of a slow, gradual change, rather than an immediate change,” said David Bonan, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington who served as the lead author on the Nature Geoscience study. The full collapse of the current might not be reached this century, rather than around the midcentury mark as other research has predicted.
The stakes could hardly be higher. Should the current break down, the most frightening predictions describe a world thrown into chaos: Drought could destroy India, South America, and Africa; the Eastern Seaboard of the United States would see dramatic sea level rise; and an arctic chill would spread across Europe.
“You cannot adapt to this,” said Peter Ditlevsen, the co-author of a 2023 study and an ice and climate researcher at the University of Copenhagen, in an interview with Inside Climate News. “There’s some studies of what happens to agriculture in Great Britain, and it becomes like trying to grow potatoes in northern Norway.”
A more gradual change would still cause enormous upheaval, but would give the world more time to put mitigation efforts in place.

Part of what makes AMOC’s behavior so hard to forecast is that consistent monitoring of the current didn’t begin until 2004, so the historical data is limited. When researchers run models to examine AMOC’s behavior in the past, they sometimes get baffling results. “The new models aren’t working for AMOC,” said David Thornalley, a paleoclimatologist at University College London, who wasn’t involved with the latest research. “Some people would say we don’t 100 percent know what AMOC did through the 20th century.”
The February study in Nature found that the current is more stable than expected. Winds in the Southern Ocean churn the incoming Arctic water up to the surface and send it northward again. The research showed AMOC slowing between 20 to 80 percent by 2100, but not collapsing entirely. This is obviously a pretty big range, and “even a moderate weakening could affect rainfall patterns, sea level rise, and the ocean’s ability to take up carbon,” said Jonathan Baker, lead author of the study and a senior scientist in the ocean, cryosphere, and climate group at the Met Office, the weather service for the U.K. Between 2009 and 2010, AMOC wobbled — slowing about 30 percent — and sea levels rose 5 inches between New York City and Newfoundland within a year.
The most recent study in Nature Geosciences narrowed that range to a weakening of 18 to 43 percent by 2100 after investigating how previous models were making their calculations. Models that predict an imminent collapse tend to assume AMOC is fairly strong at the moment, extending to great depths within the ocean and forcing warm surface water deep into the sea. Models that presented the current as weaker, with a shallower reach into the deep ocean, were less affected by warming surface waters.
Bonan and his team found that the North Atlantic is “a little bit more aligned with these weaker models,” he said. “If you warmed up the surface [water], or if you have increased sea ice melt or Greenland Ice Sheet melt, a lot of those surface properties are probably just going to stay at the upper ocean, rather than going deeper into the ocean.”
Still, Bonan highlighted the need for more advanced models that may be able to better forecast interactions between ice sheets and the ocean. Thornalley underlined those concerns — without sophisticated modeling of meltwater coming off Greenland, he said, these studies might be painting an overly rosy picture. “If you look at what all the models do after 2100, a lot of them go on to collapse,” he said.
One problem with estimating a drop-dead date for AMOC is that researchers still don’t understand when the current might reach a tipping point, a threshold that, when crossed, will have a cascading effect from which there is no return. Whether the current dies a slower or faster death won’t matter in the long run if the world breaches that threshold. “It’s a good study,” Thornalley said. “Does it make me calmer about the future? No.”

(Photo By Getty Images)A solar industry group is warning that Kentucky stands to lose out on thousands of jobs in manufacturing solar energy components and batteries if clean energy tax credits are cut short under a mega-bill moving through Congress. 
An analysis published in late May by the nationwide Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) says Republican-led efforts to curtail or sunset tax credits would cost more than 300,000 jobs across the country and sacrifice hundreds of billions of dollars of investment through the end of the decade. Some of the credits are technology neutral but benefit solar and battery manufacturing industries. 
Republicans in Congress axed the ‘green new scam,’ but it’s a red state boon

The U.S. House has approved the spending and tax bill, dubbed the “big, beautiful bill” by President Donald Trump. It is now under consideration by the U.S. Senate. Republicans are using a process called reconciliation to move the bill with a simple majority of votes in the Senate, rather than the three-fifths majority usually required in the upper chamber. That means the package could become law without any Democrats’ votes.
The bill as it came out of the House would accelerate the phase down of tax credits benefiting clean energy production, low-emission hydrogen fuel production, components for renewable energy, carbon capture technologies and the purchase of electric vehicles. These tax credits were created under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and championed by the former Biden administration. A States Newsroom analysis found the tax credits primarily benefitRepublican-controlled states. 
In Kentucky, where solar and battery manufacturing industries are growing though at a slower pace than in other states, the Solar Energy Industries Association estimates about 3,300 existing and potential jobs could be lost. 
Brenden Frazier, a board member for the advocacy organization Kentucky Solar Energy Society, said the sunsetting of tax credits could hamper the residential solar industry in the state. He said recent “Solarize” campaigns, in which cities encourage residents to adopt solar energy in their homes and businesses, show the incentives are having a “big impact” in terms of growing the industry in Kentucky.  
He said he worries about sustaining the business  without the incentives. Frazier serves as the director of product and technology for the Puerto Rico-based solar panel manufacturer SOLX. 
Frazier said the loss of tax credits would set back solar and battery manufacturing as Kentucky, like much of the rest of the country, faces growing energy demands from prospective data centers coming onto the electricity grid. 
While the amount of electricity generated through solar energy in Kentucky is miniscule, the state has seen an influx of solar developers interested in setting up utility-scale solar installations. A Canadian company also announced last year it was investing over $700 million in a Shelby County manufacturing plant to build utility-scale battery storage systems. 
Republicans supportive of ending the tax credits have argued they are too expensive and that incentives give renewable energy an unfair advantage over fossil fuel production. 
Republican Kentucky U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in May said the reconciliation legislation would end spending on “Green New Deal-style waste” and “reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act.”
Matt Partymiller, the president of the Kentucky Solar Energy Industries Association, told the Lantern the accelerated phase down of the tax credits is a “real threat to manufacturing jobs” and to the United States’ ability to compete with China on solar energy. 
“We just started onshoring U.S, manufacturing of solar in earnest in the past couple of years,” Partymiller said. “A lot of these incentives are really tied to that, and if they go away, I think this whole manufacturing industry that was just created largely stops with it.” 
Solar panel manufacturers across the country have significantly ramped up production in recent years to meet a boom in utility-scale solar energy development, producing enough solar panels to generate nearly 52 gigawatts of electricity. China has historically controlled much of the world’s solar panel production as the country has subsidized production. 
The U.S. Senate will likely change the version of the reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House in May.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Modern public policy debates – particularly those surrounding matters of government budgeting – frequently delve into and hinge on complex issues of public finance and economic forecasting.
The current divide between North Carolina Senate and House Republicans over whether to slow down or plow ahead with scheduled income tax cuts is a classic example. The ultimate decision will hinge in large part upon which economic projection carries the day – the Senate’s assessment that state revenues will remain strong even with new tax cuts, or the House’s take that the nation’s softening economy, along with big federal budget cuts, provide grounds for caution.
For many other important debates, however, the criteria lawmakers will ultimately use in making their decisions are not nearly so grand or data driven. Indeed, in many instances, the basis for the decision will come down to a question rooted in gut instinct: Are the people who will benefit worthy?
Seriously. This is not a parody or an exaggeration. Right now, Republican elected leaders in Washington and Raleigh are advancing major changes to how the nation and state dispense social safety net benefits, based not on a complex calculus about how the decision will improve societal outcomes, save lives, or even save the government money.
Instead, the changes are premised on the sponsors’ belief that the people to be cut off from assistance don’t deserve it. It’s really that crass and simple.
The prime example of this brand of decision making is the plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid health insurance enrollees. Under the so-called “big, beautiful bill” narrowly passed by the U.S. House at President Trump’s behest late last month, millions of current low-income program participants will be required to regularly prove that they are working a prescribed number of hours each month, or that they fit into a number of vaguely worded exemptions.
In other words, according to the scheme, poor people who work fewer hours or sporadically at odd jobs (as is so common among many people of modest means trying to scratch out a living) do not deserve health insurance.
Never mind that verifying the work status of millions of people on a regular basis will necessitate the creation of a vast new government bureaucracy. Never mind the research that shows millions of poor people will lose coverage because they lack the wherewithal (computers, transportation, basic literacy) to properly document their work histories. Never mind the research showing that such a change would bankrupt hundreds of community health centers that rely upon Medicaid reimbursements. Never mind that this will, in turn, result in a flood of struggling people inundating hospital emergency rooms. Never mind that thousands of people will experience premature deaths.
In a recent interview with NC Newsline, Sara Rosenbaum a Professor Health Law and Policy at the George Washington University, who recently published a report on work requirements, derided the policy as the latest iteration of the infamous English Poor Laws of 1601 that likewise conditioned public aid on supposed worthiness. “It’s inconceivable to me that we would, in 21st Century America, tell [a poor person] ‘you’re not worthy,’” Rosenbaum said.
Meanwhile, two program reductions advanced by GOP budget writers in the North Carolina General Assembly recently appear to be cut from the same maddening cloth.
The first would eliminate a state Department of Health and Human Services program launched in 2022 called “Healthy Opportunities.”
The program, which has operated as a pilot project in three counties, is based on the simple premise that helping people enrolled in Medicaid with food, transportation, housing, and other non-medical health-related needs would improve their physical health.
And you know what? It did. Program participants were healthier and ended up in hospital emergency rooms less. Indeed, when researchers compared health care costs in the 12 months before and the 12 months after enrollment in Healthy Opportunities, they found cost savings of 85 dollars per person, per month.
Unfortunately, like their colleagues in Washington, North Carolina lawmakers appear to have decided that recipient “worthiness” is more important than saving lives and money, and so unless saner voices prevail, the program will go away.
And the same appears to be true for Medicaid coverage of weight-loss prescriptions. As Jonathan Ray – a Charlotte physician assistant – wrote in a recent essay for NC Newsline, “obesity is not merely a matter of personal responsibility; it’s a complex health issue influenced by various factors, including genetics, environment, and socioeconomic status.”
And these medicines (like Wegovy and Ozempic) have, he added, helped thousands upon thousands of people to achieve significant weight loss, improve their metabolic health, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Unfortunately, obese people too have been deemed insufficiently worthy, regardless of the potential savings in lives and money the drugs might help secure.
In short, try as they might to portray their actions as being about protecting the public purse, the hard truth is that affluent modern American politicians are, like their predecessors in late Medieval England, smugly sentencing poor people whom they deem unworthy of aid to early deaths.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)More than 100 protesters gathered in Raleigh’s Moore Square Monday afternoon to condemn the law enforcement response to demonstrations in Los Angeles, with speakers calling for an end to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Those at the Raleigh gathering demanded the release of David Huerta, a California union leader arrested last week at a protest against ICE. Huerta, the president of Service Employees International Union California as well as SEIU United Service Workers West, was released from custody on a $50,000 bond later in the day, according to the Associated Press, and faces a federal charge for impeding an officer.
Activists with the Union of Southern Service Workers, Siembra NC, the North Carolina Association of Educators, and an array of Triangle area civil rights and labor organizations met in the Square for a “rapid-response” rally to stand in solidarity with the LA protests. Protesters chanted “Free David, end ICE!” and “No justice, no peace!” with some wearing union apparel, keffiyehs, and other symbols of resistance.
The protest took place as clashes between demonstrators and police in downtown LA came to an inflection point Monday, with President Donald Trump deploying 700 U.S. Marines to the city in a move that opponents have criticized as authoritarian, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who Trump said should be arrested. Law enforcement have used tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets to respond to the protests against immigration raids in the city, which have seen some demonstrators set fire to self-driving vehicles and throw objects at police.




Nikki Marín Baena, co-founder of immigrant rights group Siembra NC, condemned ICE agents for conducting masked raids of workplaces and schools as part of mass deportation campaign by the Trump administration.
“They feel they are above the Constitution. Do you feel that ICE agents are above the Constitution?” Banea asked, to which protesters shouted no. “Are you ready to fight back?”
Josh Vincent, executive director of the Southern Vision Alliance, likened ICE agents to the enforcers of slavery in the Antebellum South. And he compared the protesters in LA to groups that played a central role in the Civil Rights Movement, naming the Black Panther Party and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
“The same forces trying to dehumanize immigrants today are the same forces that tried to break us through slavery, through Jim Crow, through mass incarceration, through redlining, and through state violence,” Vincent said. “This movement isn’t new, it’s just wearing new clothes.”

Also among the speakers was Claudia De la Cruz, an activist who ran as the Party for Socialism and Liberation’s candidate in the 2024 presidential election, garnering roughly 165,000 votes around the country. She attended Monday’s protest as part of a “Freedom Ride” from Newark, New Jersey to Jena, Louisiana — both locations of ICE facilities that have come under greater scrutiny amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation operations.
“It’s important to understand who the criminals are and who our enemies are — and they’re not immigrants,” De la Cruz said. “If we do not understand an injury to the immigrant community as an injury to us, they will come for us, too.”
De la Cruz called ICE agents “kidnappers” who are “terrorizing our people” and said descriptions of the protesters in LA as violent criminals are part of a false narrative intended to deter resistance to deportation efforts. She blamed not just Trump but also his predecessors from both parties as well for constructing an “economic and political system that has historically separated families.”
“They are taking away entire lives. They are dividing entire families. They are dehumanizing and dismembering people,” De la Cruz said. “Are we in defense of life? Therefore, we need to be courageous in our defense of life.”
Monday’s rally came one day ahead of the North Carolina Senate’s scheduled vote on legislation (SB 153 and HB 318) that critics say would target immigrant communities and expand the state’s cooperation with ICE.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Abolish-ICE-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo courtesy of Coastal Virginia Conservancy). 2025 05 16 Upper Brandon-NOAA ResponseHampton Roads environmental groups are alarmed over a proposed federal decision that they say could undermine decades of local tidal wetlands restoration and protection.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality are moving toward approval of a new wetland mitigation bank in Prince George County — 50 miles upstream from Hampton Roads — that would allow developers to purchase mitigation credits from outside the region.
Wetland mitigation banks are designed to compensate for environmental damage caused by permitted development projects. Developers buy credits from these banks to offset the impacts, typically by funding the creation or restoration of similar wetlands nearby.
The plan to outsource part of the process has prompted fierce opposition from conservationists, who warn that exporting these credits could lead to the continued loss of local saltwater tidal wetlands without restoring equivalent benefits in the region.
“This allows damages to local wetlands to still occur, but Hampton Roads will lose out on the extensive services and ecological benefits these wetland mitigation sites are designed to offset,” Coastal Virginia Conservancy, a Hampton Roads-based environmental group, said in a statement.
Helen Kuhns, the organization’s executive director, said in a phone interview that the proposed bank represents a dramatic break from long-established practices. 
“In the past, the Army Corps has been very specific about the need for that mitigation to be done in the waterway, or at least in the life ecosystem that the damage is being done,” she said. “But the new bank that is proposed is in Prince George County, it’s 50 miles up the river. And the ecosystem there is not the same as it is here in Hampton Roads.” 
Kuhns warned that credits purchased there would not deliver ecological benefits to impacted waterways like the Elizabeth River. “We would lose those ecosystem services,” she said.
A spokesman for the Army Corps did not provide a comment Monday.
For over 20 years, banks in Hampton Roads have generated more than 75 acres of restored tidal wetlands, supporting local infrastructure projects while preserving critical ecological services.
The proposed shift to an “out-of-kind” mitigation site — replacing saltwater tidal wetlands with freshwater tidal systems — represents a stark departure from that approach.
“The benefits of our local saltwater tidal wetlands are numerous and include coastal protection, erosion control, water quality improvement, aquatic species habitat and nurseries, carbon sequestration, and environmental contaminant remediation,” Coastal Virginia Conservancy stated.
Mary-Carson Stiff, executive director of Wetlands Watch in Norfolk, called the shift deeply troubling. 
“Wetlands Watch is opposed to the expansion of the bank’s reach into the Hampton Roads HUC, because the wetlands losses that we will expect to experience in Hampton Roads cannot be replaced through the creation of wetlands outside of our region,” she said. 
Stiff noted that under the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) system — a national watershed classification system — trading mitigation credits across these distinct watershed boundaries compromises the integrity of local restoration.
“In coastal Virginia, our wetlands loss rates are staggering with the impacts of sea level rise,” Stiff added. “Wetlands growth rates can’t keep up with sea level rise rates, so our wetlands are drowning in place. And if we don’t do something about it, we’re projected to lose as much as 89% of tidal wetlands by 2080.”
Opponents also argue that freshwater wetlands in Prince George County cannot replicate those benefits. Coastal advocates further point to historical damage in areas like Norfolk — where the loss of wetlands has contributed to severe flooding — as evidence of why keeping restoration local is critical. 
“Just considering exporting the flood storage capacity alone, Norfolk’s flood wall has a price tag of $2.7 billion,” Coastal Virginia Conservancy said.
Stiff emphasized the economic stakes as well. 
“Wetlands provide countless ecosystem services, they are the most productive ecosystems in the world,” she said. From filtering pollutants and absorbing floodwaters to supporting fisheries and tourism, she noted, “without them, our fishing economy will tank, which provides a really important economic benefit to everyone in Virginia, not just in our region.”
The Corps has issued a notice of intent to approve the bank, despite objections from federal environmental agencies, local wetland experts, and grassroots groups across the region.
In response to the growing criticism, Irina Calos, a spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, clarified that the notice of intent came from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, not DEQ. 
She noted that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission and the Interagency Review Team (IRT) jointly oversee tidal wetland mitigation banks, with the Army Corps serving as the lead federal agency. 
“The response from the Army Corps to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concludes that the bank complies with applicable laws and would provide the functions and services of tidal wetlands that would provide similar structure and function to the impacted tidal wetland,” Calos said. “As such, we would defer to VMRC and the Army Corps on tidal waters.”
Kuhns stressed that the state agency still plays a role in those decisions. 
“The DEQ’s role in this is that they are part of the Interagency Review Team, and that is the committee that oversees restoration,” she said. “But I will say that the Army Corps does hold the highest influence there.”
According to Kuhns, the Corps originally helped establish the idea of local mitigation to ensure companies damaging tidal environments restored what they took away. 
“We started understanding the important role that wetlands were playing, and why we needed to hold on to those,” she said. “The Army Corps had set up a program that when a company damages wetlands or river bottoms or oyster reefs in a construction capacity, then they have to mitigate for that damage within the watershed ecosystem that they are impacting.”
Stiff argued that the current plan violates that spirit. 
“Everybody understands that in-kind replacement is the preferred option. And so breaking that trend is highly irregular,” she said. “The wetlands benefits that we’re deriving in our region are important to our region. And they’re more critically important to the property owners at the site where the damage is occurring.”
Coastal Virginia Conservancy warned that the precedent could set back progress made over the last two decades in restoring and protecting Hampton Roads’ unique coastal ecosystem.
“In the past, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has worked tirelessly to restore and make sure that damages were mitigated locally,” the group said in its statement. “The pending decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leaves Hampton Roads-based environmental groups greatly confused and concerned about the future of restoration in our local waters.”

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)In about 10 days, we will know the names of all the candidates who will appear on November’s general election ballot for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in Virginia.
What we might not know by then is whether both parties’ tickets are unified.
The nominees are set in the Republican Party. So there should have been no need there for the acrimony and infighting that tests the bonds of party cohesiveness in the run-up to primary elections and then the strained, awkward rapprochements that follow. Right?
The Democrats still have that bridge to cross with a six-way primary for lieutenant governor and a one-to-one showdown in the attorney general primary. 
Levar Stoney ended his two terms as Richmond’s mayor days before a January water treatment plant emergency left residents of the city and some parts of surrounding localities either without water altogether or having to boil it before consumption. Aaron Rouse is a former football star and state senator representing Virginia Beach. Ghazala Hashmi is also a state senator whose district takes in parts of Richmond and Chesterfield County. Three other candidates are newcomers to state-level politics: Victor Salgado, a public corruption prosecutor who resigned from the Justice Department after President Donald Trump’s election; ophthalmologist Babur Lateef and lawyer and labor leader Alex Bastani.
The winner faces Republican nominee John Reid this fall.
Her time has come: Virginia will, after four centuries, have a woman governor

Democrats Shannon Taylor, Henrico County’s two-term commonwealth’s attorney, and Jay Jones, a former Virginia delegate, former District of Columbia assistant attorney general and son of the late judge and legislator Jerrauld Jones are vying to be the state’s next AG. The victor faces Jason Miyares, a Republican seeking a second term, in November.
The party’s gubernatorial nominee, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, has no intraparty opponent. She and the Republican nominee, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, are already on a general election collision course.
We shall see if the Democrats can keep it sufficiently civil to credibly make amends once the ballots are counted and nominees declared on June 17. So far, they’ve created little drama as each, to varying degrees, claims to be the best prepared to stand against Trump, who is zero-for-lifetime when his name has been on Virginia’s ballot and has been an albatross for his party here.
Va. statewide GOP nominees refuse to buck Trump in a state where he’s a proven albatross

Time will tell if the Democrats — who rarely meet an opportunity they can’t squander — form a united front and make compelling arguments for voters to trust them, not just assume Trump will sink his ticket again.
From job losses mainly in Northern Virginia to varied urban dysfunctions in Richmond to persistent economic atrophy in rural areas, their nominees need to do the research, listen to a broad swath of constituents and bring fresh, resonant answers to the table.
As for Republicans, fate seemed to smile on them by obviating the need for primaries. Rather than spending time and money eviscerating one another, they had the chance to marshal their resources, cultivate cohesion as a ticket and fire outward at Democrats quarreling among themselves.
That didn’t happen. Segments of the GOP trashed President Ronald Reagan’s 11th Commandment and launched a homophobic, incomprehensibly stupid and ultimately futile effort to blackmail Reid — Virginia’s first openly gay statewide nominee — into quitting the race.     
For more than a week, Virginia Republicans watched their party’s elite practice a shocking level of fratricide, particularly for a critical statewide election year. What began as a Machiavellian plot to bully Reid into retreat in the face of ruinous (and specious) accusations, enlisting allied evangelicals behind the putsch, resulted in the governor himself, Glenn Youngkin, playing the heavy.
They didn’t know Reid. A former conservative talk radio host who inherited a flinty bring-it-on mindset from his dad, the late Del. Jack Reid, the younger Reid responded with the political equivalent of brass knuckles on one hand and a busted long-neck beer bottle in the other. He shot back with blistering social media videos and a sobering cease-and-desist demand from his lawyer that suggested imminent libel litigation.
The GOP’s disgraceful bid to sandbag its openly gay lieutenant governor nominee

Things died down a bit after Matt Moran, a top Youngkin political Svengali, took the fall. After damning disclosures and Republican recriminations dominated each day’s news cycle for more than a week, Moran was done as the head of Youngkin’s fundraising juggernaut political action committee, Spirit of Virginia.
You’d imagine that would be both a teaching moment and/or occasion for healing. Yet through it all, Earle-Sears has made clear her assertion that it’s every Republican for himself (or herself).
Earle-Sears was a no-show at weekend campaign appearances with Reid in heavily GOP-voting Southwest Virginia the day after the scandal broke in late April. Reid campaigned with U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, and was warmly received, according to on-scene coverage by Laura Vozella of The Washington Post.
The following week, a GOP “unity rally” in which Reid was to appear with Earle-Sears, Miyares and Youngkin was canceled without explanation. A defiant Reid booked the same Henrico County venue for the same hour as the canceled event and packed it with hometown supporters. On April 29, Earle-Sears broke her silence on Reid with a statement posted on social media that reads like a divorce petition, saying the focus on Reid “distracted” the GOP ticket.
“John Reid is the Republican nominee for Lt. Governor. It is his race and his decision alone to move forward,” she wrote. “We all have our own race to run.”
This isn’t the first time members of a statewide ticket have played keep-away from one of its members. In the 2001 election for the top three state executive offices, each party had an odd man out. 
On the Democratic side, ticket leader Mark Warner had seen his party get pounded in recent —elections in increasingly Republican-voting rural Virginia. He ran for governor as a “centrist” who sought to rural voters with promises not to impose new gun restrictions. While he didn’t win the NRA’s endorsement, he kept the organization neutral in the election. Attorney general nominee A. Donald McEachin, however, had watched gun violence turn his home streets in Richmond into killing fields in the 1990s and was a stalwart gun-control advocate. Not only did the candidates coexist uneasily on the 2001 ticket, McEachin and Democratic former Gov. Doug Wilder slammed Warner over his coziness with the NRA in an extraordinary news conference that would have been front-page news if not for its timing: 9 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001.
Appreciation: Congressman A. Donald McEachin

On the GOP side, gubernatorial candidate Mark Earley and attorney general nominee Jerry Kilgore also avoided getting too close to the party’s lieutenant governor nominee, Del. Jay Katzen. 
McEachin lost to Republican Jerry W. Kilgore. Katzen lost to future Gov. and U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine. 
The difference is that Earle-Sears, the ticket leader, has said it publicly and repeatedly — including once in writing. Miyares has neither embraced nor distanced himself from Reid and/or Earle-Sears. He has remained silent throughout the tumult.
Her position that the GOP candidates were free agents appeared unchanged last week when Radio IQ political correspondent Michael Pope reminded Earle-Sears that she, Miyares and Reid had yet to publicly appear together.
“Actually, as you know, we are all running our campaigns,” she said.
Yes, ma’am. We know. By now, so do Virginia voters.
We’re just waiting for you to explain the reason why.

(Photo courtesy of the Transportation Security Administration)Identification screening technology that launched during the pandemic to reduce airport check-in times has helped improve security and travelers’ experiences, but carries a privacy concern stemming from the capture and storage of passengers’ photos.
Virginia lawmakers, privacy advocates and others have questioned how images of citizens are used and stored, and how peoples’ rights are being protected. 
The Transportation Security Administration said in a Thursday announcement that the images captured on the airport screening technology known as Credential Authentication Technology (CAT-2) “are never stored” or “used for any other purpose than immediate identification.”
House Communication, Technology and Innovation Committee Chair Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, said tools like CAT-2 are helpful, but safeguards are important to protect civil liberties and privacy as the technology advances. 
“Travelers deserve both speed and security when it comes to travel, but it’s not at the expense of their privacy,” Hayes told the Mercury.
CAT-2 was first tested at Ronald Reagan Washington Airport in August 2020. Since then, TSA said it has been using the cameras carefully in conjunction with the research from the National Institute of Standards and Technology standards.
The administration said CAT-2 allows TSA officers to scan a traveler’s photo identification card and capture a real-time photo of them, too. Once the images of the traveler are confirmed, that person is able to proceed for further screening. CAT-2 also includes a plexiglass shield to minimize contact between TSA officers and travelers, and uses a secure Internet connection allowing the units to verify that an individual is ticketed for air travel, eliminating the need to show a boarding pass.
Passengers who do not wish to participate in the facial matching process can opt out in favor of an alternative identity verification process, TSA said. The CAT-2 screens are being updated with language that notifies travelers they may decline having their photo taken.
Hayes said after the technology was piloted in Virginia, he visited multiple airports including Dulles and Norfolk International, and declined to use the technology. 
To TSA’s credit, Hayes said, he had no problem being screened. Officers identified him manually using his identification card and boarding pass. 
Hayes said he hopes the procedures and policy governing the photos will be codified to ensure travelers’ privacy remains a priority and that their photos won’t be stored or used beyond screenings.
“What’s to prevent that from changing and then all of a sudden, a different administration or depending who’s overseeing it, they could change that policy,” Hayes said. “It needs to be codified, I believe, and absent the lack of any federal law, I think the states need to begin to address that, just as we did with the Consumer Data Protection Act.”
The Act provides residents certain rights that shield personal data collection by businesses.

(Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A list of 14 states, 298 counties and 200 cities deemed immigration sanctuaries by the Trump administration has disappeared from a government website but continues to hang over the heads of officials who face threats of losing federal funding.
“We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause,” said Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, North Carolina, a heavily Democratic county that nevertheless complies with a new state law requiring cooperation with immigration arrests.
“The list is gone. Am I satisfied that it was rectified? Yes. Am I satisfied that it’s over? No,” Blackwood said.
The list went up May 29. It called out the “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The White House had already threatened “suspension or termination” of federal funds to them.
In Maine, Cumberland and Hancock counties and the city of Portland were listed as sanctuary jurisdictions. Along with counties and cities, the list named the whole states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia as “state sanctuary” areas.










We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause. 


– Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, N.C.


There was immediate reaction from some areas, not only Democratic states and counties with court-tested legal policies of declining cooperation with deportation, but also conservative areas mystified by their inclusion.
“We figure it must be some kind of mix-up. We certainly support our fellow law enforcement agencies,” said James Davel, administrative coordinator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, which was included despite no apparent immigration sanctuary policy. The county voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 by more than 67%.
One possible explanation: The county board passed a resolution in 2021 declaring Shawano a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” as a sign of “vigorous support of the peoples’ Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.”
States are telling sheriffs whether they can — or can’t — work with ICE

The list disappeared from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website in a matter of days, after the National Sheriffs’ Association complained that many counties were erroneously included.
“It was quite the debacle,” said sheriffs’ association spokesperson Patrick Royal. “We are working with the administration to resolve as much as we can.”
But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a television appearance that the list would come back and was largely accurate.
“That list is absolutely continuing to be used and it is going to be identifying those cities and those jurisdictions that aren’t honoring law and justice,” Noem said in a Fox News interview June 1.
Courts have so far upheld local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration arrests. California won a lawsuit on the issue in 2017 under the first Trump administration, and the same federal judge issued an injunction saying federal funds couldn’t be withheld on the basis of immigration cooperation during a new trial on the issue.
The national sheriffs’ association president, Sheriff Kieran Donahue of Canyon County, Idaho, said in a May 31 statement that the list “was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation.” He said it was “an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.” Canyon County was not on the list, though the city of Boise was.
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

The pushback from sheriffs was a sign of how seriously flawed the list was, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
“The real problem is, how are they defining sanctuary?” Putzel-Kavanaugh said. “To have pushback from an association that is typically quite supportive of this administration and their agenda points to problems with definition.”
Watauga County, North Carolina, was on the list when it first appeared May 29 but came off before it was taken down. The county’s congressional representative, Republican Virginia Foxx, said in a Facebook post that she intervened.
In the post, Foxx called it “a mistake … made during the Biden administration that resulted in Watauga County being listed incorrectly as a sanctuary county.” She also said that “Watauga County is no longer listed” after she “contacted DHS.”
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group favoring less immigration, said her list of sanctuary jurisdictions included Watauga based on a June 2024 report from U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement listing it as among hundreds of others as “non-cooperative institutions.”
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Vaughan said data she requested from ICE shows some counties in North Carolina were still not complying with all detainers this year through early February, but Watauga is not one of them.
“They should probably come off the list,” she said. “None of those sheriffs has contacted me about reviewing their policies or taking them off the map. I would be happy to do so, and have done so frequently with sheriffs in other states.”
Sheriff Len Hagaman of Watauga County told Stateline via email that he had contacted federal immigration officials and confirmed that his county, which voted Democratic for president last year by a 52% to 46% margin, had a solid record of cooperating with immigration arrests.
Hagaman alluded to an April Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, calling out Watauga and eight other North Carolina counties as immigration sanctuaries.
“For several weeks now, I, along with other North Carolina sheriffs have had to endure gross and inaccurate misinformation regarding false allegations,” Hagaman wrote.

(Tim Boyle/Getty Images)A third federal lawsuit, filed Monday, challenges Arkansas’ first-in-the-nation law restricting the activity of pharmacy benefit managers in the state, arguing that it limits both a competitive pharmacy market and patients’ access to prescription drugs.
Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers. Navitus Health Solutions, one of the plaintiffs in Monday’s lawsuit, urged lawmakers in April not to pass the bill that became Act 624 of 2025. The law bans pharmacy benefit managers from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026.
In Monday’s complaint, Navitus and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) allege that Act 624 will unfairly prevent out-of-state companies from doing business in Arkansas in the name of keeping local independent pharmacies afloat.
“Not only does Act 624 set out to protect local businesses from competition by out-of-state businesses, but it also aims to punish a discrete population of companies for perceived misconduct,” the complaint states.
The Arkansas Insurance Department received thousands of complaints in 2024, claiming PBMs either illegally paid them below, at or just above the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, independent pharmacists and the department’s general counsel told lawmakers last year.
Arkansas governor signs first-in-the-nation ban on drug middlemen owning pharmacies

Act 900 of 2015 required pharmacy benefit managers to pay pharmacies this average price at minimum, and the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed and upheld the law in 2020 after PCMA challenged it.
Lawmakers and the Arkansas Pharmacists Association have claimed PBMs also routinely violate two 2018 laws that prohibit them from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors. The plaintiffs in Monday’s lawsuit claim this allegation is false.
“Arkansas has never formally alleged in any judicial proceeding that PCMA’s members or Navitus has violated these laws, and such allegations would not hold up in court if ever it did,” the complaint states.
The Federal Trade Commission released an interim report in July 2024 saying PBMs are eliminating competition and increasing drug prices at the expense of patients. The report also states that three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people. Lawmakers of both political parties frequently cited the FTC report when expressing support for Act 624.
CVS Pharmacy Inc., Caremark’s parent company, and Express Scripts each challenged Act 624 in federal court on May 29. Similarly to Monday’s lawsuit, the other two argue that the law violates the U.S. Constitution by interfering with interstate commerce. The three complaints also allege that federal law preempts state laws that affect employee health plans and Medicare coverage.
All three suits take issue with Act 624’s exemption of the state’s largest employer, Walmart, from the ban on PBMs owning pharmacy permits. They also claim Arkansans will lose access to mail-order and specialty pharmacy services, which are the only means of obtaining specific drugs.
The lawsuits all ask the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Arkansas to bar enforcement of the law as well as declare it unconstitutional.
Similarly to the CVS complaint, PCMA and Navitus’ complaint calls Act 624 “unconstitutional economic protectionism, violating the foundational constitutional rule that states may not enact laws to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors.”

PCMA and Navitus complaint 
“This discrimination is not justified by any legitimate, non-protectionist local interest. Even if the state could articulate such an interest, the means chosen — categorically excluding out-of-state PBM-affiliated pharmacies — are not substantially related to the achievement of that interest and are far more restrictive than necessary,” PCMA and Navitus’ complaint states.
The complaint also calls Act 624 an unconstitutional bill of attainder, meaning it imposes a legislative punishment “without the benefits and procedural safeguards of a judicial proceeding.”
PCMA and Navitus’ lawsuit claims that more than 40 pharmacies that cumulatively employ more than 600 Arkansans will lose their permits and be forced to close by the end of the year. CVS claims in its lawsuit that it will be forced to close 23 pharmacies that served more than 340,000 patients and filled over 2.4 million prescriptions in 2024.
Express Scripts’ complaint states that Act 624 “imperils the health” of the 50,000 Arkansans it serves, including members of the military, their families and veterans because the PBM is the primary mail-order pharmacy provider for Tricare, the military’s health insurance program.
Act 624 allows the state pharmacy board to issue limited permits to PBMs if they provide “drugs that are otherwise unavailable in the market to a patient or a pharmacy that would otherwise be prohibited” under the law.
Attorney General Tim Griffin reiterated a previous statement that he will defend Act 624 from its challengers.
“PBMs leverage their affiliated pharmacies to manipulate prices, corrupt the market, and destroy competition,” Griffin said, echoing the talking points of the law’s supporters in the Legislature.

If ever there was a once controversial issue in modern society that has since become a settled matter, it is the question of cannabis legalization. While there’s no doubt that cannabis – that is, marijuana and THC products – raises important public health challenges, it’s also clear that this cow is not going back in the barn.
Indeed, with cannabis possession and sales now fully legal for most Americans, it’s absurd and unjust that a few states, including North Carolina, still criminalize possession – even for medical purposes.
And it’s in light of this simple truth that Gov. Josh Stein’s recent decision to establish a new task force on the subject is a welcome and overdue step.
As Stein notes, the current system that criminalizes some products and leaves other similar ones totally unregulated makes no sense.
The bottom line: It’s long past time for North Carolina to legalize cannabis. But it’s also essential that legalization occur in a way that protects consumers – particularly kids – and public health. Let’s hope Stein’s task force helps make it happen.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)A coalition of government watchdog groups are warning state legislation could hobble Ohio’s initiative process. Direct democracy has been available to Ohioans since 1912, and citizen-led groups can organize initiated statutes or constitutional amendments.
The proposals would create strict new paperwork requirements and add other administrative hurdles like requiring many circulators wear a badge identifying themselves as “paid” even if they’re given something as small as a pen for signature collection.
Above and beyond changes to the initiative process, the bills would also eliminate ballot drop boxes and require all voters to show proof of citizenship to cast a ballot.
“Bottom line, this is attack on direct democracy,” Jen Miller from Ohio’s League of Women Voters argued. “This is an attack on local control. It’s an attempt to bully, intimidate, harass, and possibly prosecute people just because they want to take part in democracy,”
Nitty-gritty
Common Cause Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer praised the people who grab clipboards and collect signatures to put proposals on the ballot.
“This extreme legislation is an attempt to bully, intimidate, and hassle these front-line heroes,” she argued.
The paperwork involved in signature gathering is already complex and time consuming. She explained circulators have to fill out a standard form — name, address, employer, etc. — when they turn in petitions. But the new bills would ratchet up the stakes of that relatively banal procedure. Right now, if the circulator messes something up, they can cross it out and write their initials.
Opponents warn of harm to eligible voters if Ohio lawmakers require citizenship documents

“And it is accepted as a change that was legally made,” Turcer explained. “House bill 233, and Senate bill 153, would make it so that any error here, anything that you made a mistake on, it would mean that the entire booklet would be invalid. And just, I can’t imagine the number of signatures that would just get tossed out.”
She added that provisions requiring circulators to wear a badge identifying themselves as “paid” if they accept “anything of value,” sets an unrealistic standard.
“If I were to give a clipboard and a pen to a volunteer, and a t-shirt that says the name of the campaign,” she explained, “anything of value would then mean that a circulator would have to get a badge.”
That’s more paperwork, she said, and thus more chances for something to go wrong.
Turcer also criticized a provision requiring an individual to be registered to vote prior to signing a petition, rather than by the time the petition gets filed with election officials.
“One of the things that we often do is check registration before we before people sign,” Turcer explained, “so that we can get somebody registered as we’re doing a ballot measure.”
Taking that opportunity away doesn’t just reduce their signature count, Turcer argued, “it also stops that opportunity for a voter-to-voter conversation about, well, this is why you should get registered. These are the things that are coming up on the upcoming ballot.”
Stakes
Ohio Unity Coalition Executive Director Petee Talley drew a straight line from 2023’s Issue 1 defeat, which rejected a GOP-led effort to make it harder to amend the state constitution, and the current slate of legislation. She argued the latest bills are “retribution” for that defeat.
Talley took particular offense at the provision requiring signature gatherers wear a badge if they’re compensated.
“If I wanted to give a can of cold pop and a slice of pizza to someone and maybe even a t-shirt that (Turcer) alluded to, suddenly they’re going to have to add wearing a badge to all of that stuff?” she asked.
“It’s nothing but intimidation. It’s nothing but bullying,” she argued. “It’s voter harassment, and this is an attack on our voice and our rights, and we’re not going to stand for it.”
Miller walked through the follow-on consequences of requiring paid circulator badges. Some voters will mistakenly think volunteers who got a slice of pizza are actually getting a paycheck, she said.
“We should expect opposition trackers attempting to catch circulators without their badges,” she added. “And with the increase in uncivil and polarized rhetoric in political venues, this could result in intimidation or even violence against circulators or voters signing those petitions.”
What’s more, Miller said, “boards of elections would have to become badge police.” It’s a task they don’t have the money, manpower or expertise to carry out, she argued. The requirement voters be registered before signing a petition? Miller said that might be a problem, too.
“We don’t even know if boards of elections have the technical capacity right now to verify that a voter registration was valid on the date that the voter signed,” she said.
One reason that might not have come up is that, so far, county boards haven’t been able to weigh in. The bill’s first and second hearing happened during the early voting period for this May’s primary election. The third hearing landed on the day boards had to certify the election.
Asked whether she thought that was intentional, Miller said, “I don’t think it matters. It’s shameful, either way. There is no more important constituent when it comes to democracy bills than the boards of elections.”

(Photo courtesy of the Metropolitan Public Defender)In September 2023, Ashley, a 29-year-old mother of two who grew up in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, was facing child abuse and neglect charges in a criminal case related to substance use.
Her arrest led to her being separated from her youngest daughter.
But instead of receiving jail time, Ashley was connected with a specialized advocate who took the time to understand her and her case. She completed two inpatient substance-use treatment programs. In April 2024, she started a one-year outpatient treatment program.
By that June, she had reunited with her daughter, who is now 2 years old. And in April 2025 — a year after entering outpatient treatment — Ashley’s criminal case was fully dismissed after she had met every requirement of her court-ordered plan. (Stateline agreed to withhold Ashley’s full name to prevent potential retaliation in the ongoing custody case of her older child.)
When she first entered the courtroom, Ashley recalled, she felt like a “lost puppy.” But through a collaborative defense model spearheaded by the national nonprofit Partners for Justice, she found not just support but strength.
Jaya Duckworth, who has been a client advocate in Los Angeles County for two years, helped Ashley obtain an ID, fill out and sign important documents, and connect to counseling and outpatient treatment.
A high school graduate with some college experience, Ashley now plans to return to school and continue raising her 2-year-old. She’s also working closely with her defense team to regain custody of her 9-year-old daughter.
“Without her help, I don’t think I would have been reunited with my daughter,” Ashley said in an interview with Stateline. “I have my little one here now, and I know that I’m confident to step into that courthouse and keep trying.”
Her experience reflects a growing shift in public defense — one that recognizes that attorney advocacy alone often isn’t enough.
But this shift is unfolding at a time when national momentum is swinging in the opposite direction, with many political leaders renewing calls to crack down on crime through tougher sentencing and increased policing.
Cash assistance may curb recidivism among people leaving prison, study says

“There’s just so much data out there that shows that this approach doesn’t work,” said Alaina Bloodworth, the executive director of the Black Public Defenders Association. Bloodworth previously served as a public defender in Louisiana for six years. “Tough on crime is fueled by emotions. It’s not fueled or based in any type of data.
“It has not worked for us, and it definitely doesn’t work for communities of color.”
A 2019 study by the Rand Corporation and the University of Pennsylvania Law School found that holistic defense — which integrates legal, social and community support — may not only reduce jail and prison time but may also improve long-term outcomes for clients. The study, which compared holistic and traditional public defense models in New York City over a 10-year period, found that holistic representation reduced the likelihood of a custodial sentence by 16% and reduced the expected sentence length by 24%. It also saved taxpayers an estimated $160 million on inmate housing costs.
This model has quietly taken root in pockets of the country — often showing results that are difficult to ignore. As local governments weigh various budget priorities and public safety, some public defenders and advocates are making the case that holistic support isn’t an add-on, but a necessary part of effective legal representation.
“Having holistic defense gives the client the agency and autonomy that they need to decide for themselves,” said Michael Halkias, the chief public defender for Cumberland County, Pennsylvania. “And once people feel empowered to make decisions when they’re in a system that tells them they have no power, I think ultimately it helps them in the long run.”
The county’s office has had client advocates for nearly a year.
The holistic defense model
Holistic defense, which emerged in the 1990s, pairs legal representation with social support and resources. The goal is not to excuse or overlook criminal behavior, but to address the underlying factors, such as poverty, substance use and trauma, that sometimes drive people into the justice system in the first place.
“When you meet those basic needs, it ensures that they don’t come back to the system,” Bloodworth said. “What I am not trained on is how to truly meet social needs in the way that social workers are trained or client advocates, so having a team of professionals representing someone is truly important to ensure that person actually gets the best representation.”
One of the organizations leading this shift is Partners for Justice, a national nonprofit that began operations in 2018. The group created a collaborative defense model by embedding trained client advocates directly within public defender offices, where they work alongside attorneys as part of an integrated and client-led defense team.
Some of the client advocates are recent college graduates with aspirations to go into law or public policy who commit to two-year fellowships, while others bring firsthand experience from the criminal legal system. The team’s goal is to confront the underlying causes and prevent many of the most dire consequences of criminal legal involvement.
‘Tough-on-crime’ policies are back in some places that had reimagined criminal justice

Today, Partners for Justice has placed advocates in 25 public defense agencies across 17 states. Earlier this year, the organization expanded its reach through new partnerships with the Colorado State Public Defender and the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender.
Many client advocates build their own networks of local service providers to connect clients directly with the help they need.
Sometimes, it’s walking a client through a release from incarceration plan. Other times, it’s simply holding their hand in court — or showing up with something to eat.
“One of the most important parts of my job is to contribute in a small part to restoring the dignity and humanity that the system denies them,” said Duckworth, the client advocate who worked with Ashley, the 29-year-old California mother. She is one of more than 20 advocates working within the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office.
The model eases the burden on overworked public defenders by allowing them to focus on legal strategy, rather than juggling the complex needs of dozens of clients at once.
“Our caseloads are high,” said New Jersey Public Defender Jennifer Sellitti. “But at the same time, we’re also creatures of, ‘I’m just going to do it all myself.’”
One of the biggest challenges, she said, was shifting that mindset.
“The biggest hurdle was trying to say to lawyers, ‘We want you just to lawyer,’” Sellitti told Stateline. “But that very, very quickly has turned into an incredible partnership in all three of our pilot offices.”
Since offering the Partners for Justice client advocate program in three offices across Atlantic, Hudson and Monmouth counties in March, Sellitti said, the offices have helped clients access treatment programs more quickly than they would through traditional routes like probation or recovery court.
The collaborative defense model also helps build trust between clients and their defense team. Some client advocates say there’s a common perception among defendants that public defenders don’t care about their clients. But many public defenders are stretched so thin that it’s nearly impossible to give each case the attention it deserves.
“We have been helpful in bridging that communication gap between the lawyers and their clients,” said Paul Boyd, a client advocate with the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender in Atlantic County.
Boyd, who spent time in prison, said his background helps him build trust with clients who relate to his experience and therefore better understand the heavy caseloads their attorneys face. That connection, he said, often makes clients more willing to cooperate with their defense team.
A fragile lifeline in Portland
Budget cuts in some states, though, could threaten the advocacy work.
A program that has helped dozens of defendants in the Multnomah County area of Oregon is now at risk of being cut from two of the county’s major law firms that offer public defense services. The county faces a $15.5 million budget shortfall driven by a pandemic-era drop in property tax revenues.
Public Defenders Were Scarce Before COVID. It’s Much Worse Now.

Among those the program has supported in Portland is a 33-year-old resident and Alaska Native who has lived there for nearly a decade. The resident, who asked that their name not be used out of concerns for safety, was arrested last fall and charged under Measure 11, Oregon’s mandatory-minimum sentencing law. A prison sentence loomed over them.
After spending nearly a month in county jail, they worked with client advocate Cierra Carlson on a release plan — outlining their goals for substance use recovery, going over the resources they wanted to be connected to and naming other steps to keep out of the criminal legal system.
“I was worried that I was going to fall through the cracks, that I was just going to be treated like a number,” they said in an interview with Stateline.
But upon release, they entered a “culturally specific” substance use treatment center that serves people of color. They secured more stable housing, and with Carlson’s help reactivated their food stamps and health insurance.
“I feel way more seen than I have in the past,” they said.
But Carlson’s position could soon be eliminated.
Under Multnomah County’s proposed budget, $621,261 in funding for client advocate or case manager positions at the Metropolitan Public Defender, a nonprofit law firm that contracts with the state to offer public defense services, and Multnomah Defenders Inc. would be eliminated — cutting all six positions across the county. It’s one of many potential cuts that county leaders are looking at to save money.











I was worried that I was going to fall through the cracks, that I was just going to be treated like a number.

Two amendments have been proposed to keep the program, though. One would fully reinstate the $621,261 in funding, while the other would allocate about $415,000, likely resulting in the loss of one or two positions.
The county board of commissioners is expected to vote to approve the proposed $4 billion budget on June 12.
Carlson said she’s worried about what might happen to her clients if the program were cut. “I have seen the difference that it can make.”
The proposed cuts come as Oregon’s public defense system is in crisis.
More than 3,700 people charged with crimes across the state currently have no legal representation, according to the latest state data. More than 1,700 others have missed their court dates after never being assigned an attorney — and now face active arrest warrants.
“Even if this program goes away temporarily, it’s not something that we are going to back away from because it is so critical to our work and to the success and safety of our community, too,” said Grant Hartley, the director of the Metropolitan Public Defender.

(Photos courtesy of the Sullivan, Shaheen, and Beriont campaigns, respectively) A military veteran with a previous unsuccessful bid for Congress, the daughter of a household name in New Hampshire politics, and a Harvard University professor — all Democrats — are the first to jump in the 2026 race for New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District.
Maura Sullivan, a Marine Corps veteran and former Obama administration staffer, became the first candidate to join the race in April. Former Portsmouth City Councilor Stefany Shaheen, who is the daughter of U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, followed late last month. On Wednesday, Carleigh Beriont, who teaches at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and serves on Hampton’s select board, announced her campaign. No Republican has officially entered the race yet.
The district, which has been in Democratic hands for nearly a decade, is being closely watched to see whether a Republican can flip it or whether it’s become a Democratic stronghold.
  Chris Pappas
Sullivan, Shaheen, and Beriont are vying to represent the eastern half of New Hampshire, including Manchester, the state’s largest city; the Seacoast cities of Portsmouth, Dover, and Exeter; and parts of the Lakes Region, including Laconia. Chris Pappas has represented the 1st District since 2018, but it became an open contest in April when Pappas announced a run for the Senate seat being vacated by Jeanne Shaheen.
Both Sullivan and Shaheen targeted President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk in their opening pitches to voters. Sullivan put particular emphasis on her military service in Iraq and Southeast Asia.
“I saw too many of my fellow Marines give their lives for this country to just sit by and watch Donald Trump and Elon Musk tear it down,” Sullivan said in her announcement video. “They’re driving up costs for New Hampshire families, making it even more difficult to own a home and pay the bills, and that’s why I’m running for Congress.”
Born in the Chicago area, Sullivan holds degrees from Northwestern University and Harvard. After serving in the Marine Corps, Sullivan worked in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense under former President Barack Obama. In 2017, she moved to New Hampshire and within three months announced she was running for Congress, a move widely criticized by people who pointed out how few ties she had to the state. She finished runner-up to Pappas among 11 candidates in the primary.
In her campaign announcement, Shaheen focused on health care-related issues, saying her experience raising a daughter with type 1 diabetes inspired her to fight for medical research.
“When I see Donald Trump crushing medical research in our country,” Shaheen said in her video, “when I see Elon Musk with a chainsaw chasing out our best scientists and doctors, when I see Bobby Kennedy Jr. allowing measles to run rampant because he believes in conspiracy theories instead of proven vaccines, and when I see congressional Republicans slashing Medicaid, children’s health care, veterans’ health care, all to fund massive tax breaks for billionaires and corporations, well, I’m going to fight.”
Shaheen’s mother, a mainstay of New Hampshire politics for decades, served as governor from 1997 to 2003 and has represented the state in the U.S. Senate since 2009 (she announced her upcoming retirement in March). In addition to formerly serving on the Portsmouth City Council, the younger Shaheen was chairwoman of the Portsmouth Police Commission. She works as chief strategy officer for the Manchester-based biomanufacturer ARMI and founded Good Measures, a company that seeks to connect people with chronic illnesses to proper supports.
In announcing her candidacy, Beriont characterized herself as an outsider rather than an establishment candidate.
“I’m not a career politician — I’m a mom, an educator, a neighbor,” she said in a press release. “I’ve spent my life standing up for people who don’t always have a voice in the room. Now, I’m ready to bring that same fight to Washington — not for the powerful, but for the rest of us.”
Beriont teaches religion, government, and U.S. history at Harvard. She previously worked as an organizer with Democratic campaigns. She said she hopes to build a grassroots campaign.
A swing district or one that’s become safely Democratic?
New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a challenging swing district. From 2006 to 2018, it switched hands four times between Republican Frank Guinta and Democrat Carol Shea-Porter. However, after Pappas took the seat in 2018 and won reelection three consecutive times, the seat has sat squarely in Democratic hands.
  Dante Scala
“It’ll be interesting to see once Pappas is not on the ballot — at least not for CD1 (Pappas is running for Senate) — whether the district reverts back to being more swingy than it otherwise has been during the Pappas years,” Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said. “And that raises the second question, which is … how much of that can you attribute to Pappas’ strengths as an incumbent and how much should we chalk up to the trend that, during the Trump era since 2016, New Hampshire Democrats have been unbeaten in terms of federal elections?”
Scala said if it turns out Pappas’ success was driven by his strength as a candidate, a Democratic nominee could have more difficulty. But if it turns out President Donald Trump’s dominance over the Republican Party has turned off many New Hampshire voters and made the state more liberal, they won’t have too much trouble replicating Pappas’ success. In a similar vein, he argued that during the Guinta/Shea-Porter decade, the race became dependent on “outside factors.”
“Like who was in power in the White House, for example,” he said. “I think it was those sorts of extra or outside-New Hampshire national factors — which way the national breeze is blowing — that was affecting the results.”
Scala said Pappas was able to “defy the national wind” multiple times. 2022’s elections, when then-President Joe Biden had low approval ratings, was a difficult moment for Democrats nationwide.
“There was all sorts of talk about a red wave in ‘22,” he said. “And I thought it was quite possible at the time that Pappas would be upset by that wave. But then it turned out that New Hampshire Democrats, (Sen. Maggie) Hassan and Pappas, held steady, despite the fact that we saw the wave happen elsewhere.”
Scala pointed to Pappas’ centrism and the fact that he’d been on a ballot in so many races as possible drivers of success.
“He quietly goes about the business of being an incumbent,” he said. “In some ways, it’s a throwback to an earlier era of representation, where you’re just looking out for your district. You’re not looking to make waves. You’re not trying to be a polarizing figure. You’re low-profile. But that allows people who voted for (former Republican Gov.) Chris Sununu to feel comfortable turning around and voting for Chris Pappas.”
Scala believes Trump will have an outsized influence in 2026. A Trump endorsement could play a big part in the Republican primary. Looking toward the general election, Scala pointed to a recent UNH poll that found 45% of Granite Staters approve of Trump’s job performance, which is “not terrible, but what does that look like in a year’s time?”
“Trump’s not on the ballot and on the ballot,” he said. “Trump just takes up so much oxygen politically. Once it gets past the primaries, I really think it’s a referendum on Trump. I think you have to assume that’s going to benefit the Democratic candidate, whoever that may be, and I think it’s increasingly difficult now for a Republican in particular to try, especially for the House, to develop any sort of identity that’s distinctive enough to separate himself or herself from Trump.”
On Sullivan, Shaheen, and Beriont’s side of the race, Scala said “there’s a lot of discontent with the Democratic Party in general.”
“There’s a lot of unhappiness and finger-pointing among Democrats about how they should be facing off against Trump,” he said. “Is there lightning out there that could be harnessed in a Democratic primary? You know, the way that Shea-Porter was able to do?”
Scala said it was Shea-Porter’s ardent opposition to the Iraq War in 2006 that won her the seat originally.
“She went from nobody, but was really very much a grassroots activist on an issue, the Iraq War, that split the party, and she just went like gangbusters and rode that to Congress,” he said. “You look at Shaheen, Maura Sullivan (Scala spoke with the Bulletin before Beriont’s announcement), nothing strikes me about either of those candidates as insurgent, for lack of a better word. I mean, they’re pretty much standard issue Democratic candidates. Is there someone out there who, you know, would have the wherewithal to stir the pot?”
Advice from a previously successful candidate
Where Scala thinks it’s an open question as to whether the district solidly leans democratic, Shea-Porter has no doubts.
“I wouldn’t have retired in January 2019 if I thought we hadn’t flipped it blue,” Shea-Porter told the Bulletin. “But I knew that we had.”
She argued that the Republican Party nationally has moved too far right for New Hampshire voters while Democrats from New Hampshire have stayed moderate.
  Carol Shea-Porter
“They don’t want the ugliness that we’re seeing from the MAGA party,” she said. “And they didn’t want it then either. They don’t want extremists in either camp. And we have not had a Democratic extremist.”
Shea-Porter argued that the state “is not an extremist state,” and that it typically votes “center, center-left, sometimes center-right, but never far left or far right.”
She’s been paying attention to the current political landscape.
“As I have watched this unfold, I’ve thought, ‘My gosh, this just feels in so many ways like 2006,’” she said.
Shea-Porter said when she criticized the Iraq War and other actions taken by then-President George W. Bush people accused her of not supporting the troops. Today, she said when people criticize Trump and conservative policies, they’re accused of “not thinking about America first.”
She also argued the MAGA movement is an extension of the Tea Party of the early 2010s. She, and many spectators at the time, credit backlash to the Affordable Care Act (colloquially known as Obamacare) for her two electoral defeats to Guinta. (Guinta did not respond to the Bulletin’s requests for interviews.) She notes that today, the ACA, and the Medicaid expansion it brought, have returned to the forefront of political discussions as Republicans debate cutting it. Finally, she said both eras see Republicans trying to push tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the middle and lower classes.
“Echoes of today, right?’” she said. “I mean they’re the same problems that we have — that people were struggling economically and that they didn’t have champions there for them and people were passing legislation that was only helping the rich — and I was talking about anybody who was supporting the wealthy over the middle class. And I used to say the middle class is stumbling and the poor have fallen. And that was always my line, and sadly, here we are again. Today, it’s the same thing.”
Shea-Porter said, in retirement, she’s still in touch with former colleagues and she’s “not quiet on what’s happening.”
“If I were any of these candidates right now,” she said, “I would ask constitutional scholars to go to town halls with me and talk about how endangered we are right now with a very authoritarian president and a MAGA party in Washington who’s really threatening so many groups of people and ignoring our Constitution.”
“I think these candidates need to not be afraid to go out and say, ‘Look, I plan to do everything I can to produce legislation to vote to stop this,’” she said. “But then they have to have the facts. … I would keep a list like I used to keep on George Bush and his administration, so that people would understand, here’s the list of what is wrong.”
Shea-Porter said she’s spoken to candidates in the race, offering advice, though she wouldn’t say who. For now, she said she plans not to publicly take sides in the primary, but will strongly support the Democratic nominee in the general election. She anticipates the primary being friendly without personal attacks.
Her advice for the candidates: “to not be afraid to lead on these issues. People are looking for people who will not lead from behind, but lead up front.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/cd1candidates-1024x628.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

On its own, the decision rendered by Judge Tracy Lee Dayton means the charges against Nilsa Heredia, one of the defendants accused of illegally handling other voters’ absentee ballots and tampering with a witness, will not be dropped in return for her completing a diversionary program. 
But some of the remarks that Dayton made during the hearing also sent a strong signal about how seriously she and the judicial system view the alleged crimes that took place during Bridgeport’s 2019 and 2023 Democratic mayoral primaries, several attorneys said.
During the hearing, Heredia’s attorney, Ken Krayeske, asked the judge to approve his client for the widely used diversionary program known as accelerated rehabilitation. He cited several cases in which Connecticut judges granted similar requests, including instances where public officials were accused of stealing taxpayer money.
But Dayton, who previously served as a federal prosecutor, didn’t buy that argument, and she insisted that allegations of election fraud and voter manipulation were serious matters, even when compared to cases stemming from the embezzlement of public funds.
“I have granted AR in very, very serious situations,” Dayton said. “I certainly understand my ability and discretion to do so. I find this case to be more serious.”
“I think taking someone’s vote is more serious than taking someone’s money,” she added.  
The decision to grant accelerated rehabilitation in Connecticut is made on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of each judge.
But several lawyers who reviewed the transcript from the hearing said Dayton’s sharply worded response shows that she, and the court system, are not taking the allegations of election fraud in Bridgeport lightly. And they said that could have wider implications as the seven defendants seek to either strike a deal with prosecutors or prepare for trial.
“While every case and accused are different, the judge’s comments suggest that she views the crimes — the charges and the conduct — as serious in nature,” said William Bloss, who led a civil lawsuit that overturned the results of Bridgeport’s 2023 mayoral primary.
Christopher Morano, who previously served as Connecticut’s chief state’s attorney, said the tenor of Dayton’s remarks is likely to catch the attention of the six other campaign workers, city council members and party officials who have been accused of manipulating the absentee voting process. 
“I think this judge wanted to send a strong message that if you mess with the electoral process, it’s going to be treated harshly by this court,” Morano said. 
A poster child for fraud
Dayton’s views on the ongoing criminal cases, Morano added, are likely being influenced by Bridgeport’s history of elections scandals, which has made the city a poster child for absentee ballot fraud in the United States.
Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim’s primary victories in 2019 and 2023 were both challenged in court on the grounds that absentee ballot fraud skewed the results. But it was the 2023 election that placed the city in the national spotlight after leaked surveillance footage captured several political operatives depositing stacks of absentee ballots into drop boxes.
The lawsuits and public outcry that followed those elections prompted investigations by election enforcement officials and state prosecutors. And it was those investigations that ultimately landed Heredia and the other defendants in Dayton’s courtroom last month.
State elections enforcement officials continued to clear a backlog of investigations stemming from Bridgeport’s mayoral elections in 2023 and 2024 last month, and they openly questioned the systemic nature of the problem in the city.
Krayeske, Heredia’s attorney, said he is not entirely surprised that Dayton drew such a hard line in court, given the atmosphere surrounding the criminal cases. But he said the judge’s decision is still likely to serve as a warning particularly for some of the other defendants who are accused of repeatedly violating the state’s absentee voting laws over the course of several elections. 
That list includes city councilman Alfredo Castillo and Bridgeport’s Democratic vice chairwoman Wanda Geter-Pataky, who are accused of illegally taking possession of voters’ absentee ballots during the 2019 and 2023 elections.

“Judge Dayton is deadly serious about absentee ballot fraud,” Krayeske said. “I’m glad I’m not Wanda Geter-Pataky’s lawyer, or Alfredo Castillo’s lawyer. My client is the most sympathetic, and I can’t get AR for her.”
Frank Riccio, Castillo’s attorney, declined to comment for this story. And John Gulash, Geter-Pataky’s attorney, said it would be inappropriate for him to weigh in on the judge’s remarks.
‘That’s manipulative’
Krayeske tried to sway Dayton in court by arguing that Heredia, who lives in Bridgeport’s public housing, was not a ringleader of the alleged absentee ballot schemes that prosecutors investigated in recent years. And he noted that Heredia often volunteers her time in her low-income community.
Krayeske also highlighted a letter of support that was written by Prerna Rao, an attorney who questioned Heredia during a civil lawsuit that challenged the results of Bridgeport’s 2019 Democratic mayoral primary.
Rao explained in her letter that Heredia was one of the more cooperative witnesses she examined under oath in court in 2019.
“Ms. Heredia did not design or direct the absentee ballot schemes that have plagued this city’s Democratic primaries for so many years. She did not hold political power,” Rao wrote in the letter. “While she may very well have violated the law, her subsequent conduct demonstrated a level of integrity wholly foreign to those who directed the activities for which she stands in judgment.”
But those arguments also didn’t convince Dayton. 
“You know, she wants to come in here and say how helpful she is to the community,” Dayton said of Heredia. “That’s manipulative to the community. That’s not serving the community in which you live. That’s harming the community in which you live. You’re robbing somebody of their vote.”
At one point, Dayton also questioned why election-related crimes weren’t classified as more serious offenses under Connecticut law. Illegally possessing another voter’s absentee ballot is considered a class D felony, which carries a maximum sentence of up to five years prison and a $5,000 fine.
“I’m not sure why it is a D felony,” Dayton said, before adding “It’s not up to me. I’m not part of the legislature.” 
Politicians react
Republican leaders in the General Assembly said they were glad to see that Dayton is taking the alleged election crimes in Bridgeport seriously.
“I’m hopeful that the courts view this the same way I do, and that is that these crimes impact the integrity of our elections,” said House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford. 
In recent years, Candelora and his Republican colleagues have repeatedly advocated for legislation that would create a mandatory minimum sentence of one year in prison for anyone convicted of mishandling absentee ballots. But those proposals have not passed the Democratic-led General Assembly.
Without those sentencing requirements, Candelora said, it is even more important for judges who are handling such criminal cases to show clearly that absentee ballot abuse won’t be let off easily.
“I don’t take pleasure in this, but I’m glad that the judge is viewing this as significant,” Candelora said.
Rep. Matt Blumenthal, the Democratic co-chair of the legislature’s Government Administration and Elections committee, said he believes the state’s sentencing guidelines for election-related crimes are sufficient.
“I think that five years’ imprisonment should be significant enough deterrent to prevent future misconduct,” he added.
But he also noted that it is up to the judicial system to impose an appropriate punishment when someone is found guilty of such behavior.
“As a general matter, deterrence is the most important element of preventing misconduct in our elections, and that requires swift and vigorous investigation and prosecution and punishment if appropriate,” Blumenthal said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/herediacourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The U.S. Justice Department is defending itself against two New Hampshire transgender high school students who allege that President Donald Trump’s executive orders earlier this year would unconstitutionally deprive them of playing girls’ sports. 
In a June 6 filing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard Lawson argued the two students, Parker Tirrell and Iris Turmelle, had not established an imminent risk of being affected by the executive orders. And he contended that even if the executive order did affect the students, the administration’s intent — to prevent transgender girls from playing girls’ sports — is lawful.
“… The Sports Order’s classification is rationally related to the physical advantages of males in sports and serves the legitimate government purpose of ensuring equal opportunities for females,” Lawson wrote.
The filing comes as Tirrell and Turmelle are suing the state of New Hampshire in federal court to overturn House Bill 1205, a 2024 New Hampshire law that limits middle school and high school girls’ sports teams to children who were female at birth. That law would prevent Tirrell and Turmelle, both transgender girls, from participating on their sports teams. 
In September, Judge Landya McCafferty of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily stops HB 1205 from applying to Tirrell and Turmelle, allowing them to continue playing while the case proceeds. That order does not apply to other transgender students in the state.
But while the state law is temporarily frozen, lawyers for Tirrell and Turmelle argue Trump’s executive orders this year pose a new threat. Those orders, titled “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government” and “Keeping Men out of Women’s Sports,” require the Department of Education to interpret Title IX, the law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in schools, to exclude transgender female athletes from female sports and warn school districts to align their policies to that interpretation or lose federal funding.
In February, attorneys for Turmelle and Tirrell filed a motion to expand their lawsuit against the state to also include the Trump administration, and specifically asked the New Hampshire District Court to strike down Trump’s executive orders.
The threat question
In its recent response, the Trump administration argues there is no evidence that the president’s executive orders have affected Tirrell or Turmelle yet, and that the lawsuit seeking to stop those orders should thus be dismissed. Without that direct harm, plaintiffs have failed to state a proper claim for a lawsuit, defendants wrote. 
“Plaintiffs lack constitutional standing, and their stated speculative risk of future injury is not close to imminent and may never become ripe,” the Department of Justice wrote. 
The plaintiffs had argued that the executive order “to target investigations and rescind federal funding” put the girls’ ability to continue playing on girls’ sports teams at risk. But the government argues that that alleged threat is not strong enough. And they say the plaintiffs have not met a critical two-part test: to show that the injury is both “imminent” — meaning it is “certainly impending” and not just speculative — and “particularized” — meaning it specifically affects the plaintiffs suing, and not just the general population. 
In an interview Monday, Chris Erchull, staff attorney for GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), rejected the government’s contention that the executive orders do not pose a threat to the New Hampshire students. 
He pointed to the Trump administration’s April lawsuit against the Maine Department of Education, in which the administration argued the state was violating Title IX by allowing transgender students to compete on girls’ sports teams. That example, Erchull said, indicates that the administration could easily turn its attention on New Hampshire school districts. 
“If they’re not challenging the executive order in court, without court protection, the United States Department of Education can and almost certainly will go after the school districts where these two young people play sports and try to cut funding to those schools,” he said. 
But the Department of Justice attorneys wrote that any future funding cuts to Turmelle or Tirrell’s public schools that might result from Trump’s executive order would involve a number of decisions in the future and are “far too speculative,” the government wrote. The process to cut off Title IX funds to a school district requires the Department of Education to file a notice to the school district, includes a potential hearing, and mandates a full written report to Congress, all of which can take months, the government wrote.
“Plaintiffs here do not (and cannot) plausibly allege that the Agency Defendants have even started this multi-step process for any educational program in New Hampshire, much less the two particular schools that Plaintiffs attend,” the government wrote. “They do not (and cannot) point to even an initiated investigation in New Hampshire.”
Attorneys with the Justice Department suggested that the U.S. Department of Education might not even bother with investigations into New Hampshire schools, since the state already passed a state law, HB 1205, barring transgender girls from playing girls’ sports. 
Through the lens of Title IX
Even if Tirrell and Turmelle are blocked from participating in sports, the executive orders do not violate the Fifth Amendment or Title IX, the government motion argues.
According to the motion, Trump’s executive orders are designed to protect women’s sports, meaning that they uphold the purpose of Title IX. “Because of the inherent physiological difference between males and females, the Sports Order’s policy of ‘oppos[ing] male competitive participation in women’s sports’ is substantially related to the important government interest of safety, fairness, and ensuring ‘women and girls the equal opportunity to participate and excel in competitive sports,’” the motion states.
The government’s motion continues by asserting that neither transgender status nor gender identity are protected classes under Title IX. In 2020, the Supreme Court held in Bostock v. Clayton County that gender identity is a protected class under the anti-sex-based discrimination provision of Title VII, in a case relating to employment law. But the Department of Justice says that decision does not apply to Title IX, and that the goal of keeping girls’ sports exclusive to cisgender girls is allowed under federal law.
Erchull disagrees.
“When you make a transgender status-based classification, that’s a sex-based classification,” he said. “And we have tons of precedent that says that that is entitled to heightened scrutiny, but what the federal government is saying is that that doesn’t count.” 
The plaintiffs in the case will likely file a response brief to the government’s motion in the coming weeks, and eventually the parties will appear in federal court for oral arguments, Erchull said. 
And attorneys on both sides are watching the Supreme Court this month. Justices are expected to issue a decision in United States v. Skrmetti, a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a Tennessee ban on transgender medical care. The decision could affect how both sides shape their arguments in New Hampshire, Erchull said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/transathletessuit-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

The Trump administration recently proposed a 29% cut to the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) program funding in the fiscal 2026 budget request. 


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


“OVW really is the main federal body to provide a really unique and dedicated focus for victims of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, all of these forms of gender-based violence,” said Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence Director of Public Policy Emily Gemar. “A cut to OVW grants would be significant.”
The Ohio Alliance to End Sexual Violence is a statewide nonprofit coalition that supports Ohio’s 36 rape crisis centers, provides housing for survivors and offers legal services. 
Potential reductions in funding could lead to survivors potentially not having access to life-saving interventions, Gemar said. 
“When someone has experienced a traumatic crime like sexual assault, and they call a rape crisis center hotline, someone needs to answer,” she said. “When they flee an abuser in the middle of the night, they need a safe place to go. When they take the courageous step to go and seek medical treatment in their local emergency department, an advocate has to be there, and sexual assault forensic nurse examiner has to be there.”
The proposed 29% reduction comes a couple months after the U.S. Department of Justice rescinding more than 360 federal grants in April — impacting many community based agencies that do crime prevention and serve crime victims. 
“Our folks who serve victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, dating violence, they would all be impacted by less federal funding streams to go around,” Gemar said. “We already are not a robustly funded field.”
Ninety percent of Ohio alliance legal team is funded by the Legal Assistance of Victims Program administered by the federal program.
“What we were seeing across the state is that survivors need help navigating the legal system,” said alliance Director of Advocacy & Legal Services Becca Getson. “We want to make sure that they have their rights represented.”

The alliance has saved survivors about $74,000 in legal fees in 2025 through May 1, Getson said. 
“We were able to provide that base to provide legal representation directly to the survivors, and they don’t have to then pay an attorney to be able to do very basic things like get a protection order (or) help them through a potential custody issue,” she said.
The Legal Assistance of Victims grants funds both of the alliance’s attorneys and their legal services specialist, so cuts to Office on Violence Against Women could potentially eliminate the alliance’s legal clinic, Getson said. 
“(Survivors) wouldn’t have an attorney,” she said. “This will have a detrimental impact across the state, knowing that survivors aren’t able to get that kind of justice that they’re looking for, that they deserve to have.”
According to a new poll, 87% of likely Ohio voters are in favor of federal funding for violence prevention programs and victim services and 74% agree the Trump administration and justice department should reinstate funding for victim services, community violence prevention programs, and youth outreach. 
The poll was commissioned by the Alliance for Safety and Justice and conducted by McLaughlin & Associates. 
“Elected officials on both sides of the aisle stood for safety in supporting violence prevention programs and victims services,” Shakyra Diaz, chief of shared safety for Alliance for Safety and Justice, said in a press release. “The recent cuts take us backwards, undermine public safety, and Ohio voters do not want that.”

The ban, announced just last Wednesday, is so sweeping that Lynn Tramonte of Ohio Immigrant Alliance labeled it “the new Muslim and African ban.”
“This is racism by presidential decree,” she said in a written statement. “The new Muslim and African ban is here, with a Caribbean and Asian annex.”  
Trump’s order attempts to “fully restrict and limit the entry of nationals of the following 12 countries: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.” 
In addition, it “partially” restricts the entry of people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. But that’s a distinction without a difference, Tramonte said.
Trump’s executive order says of immigration from those places, “consular officers shall reduce the validity for any other nonimmigrant visa issued to nationals… to the extent permitted by law.”
That’s “a ‘partial’ ban that is just as extensive” as the complete bans, Tramonte said.

In Ohio, Trump and some Republicans have a problematic history when it comes to the state’s sizable Haitian population. Last summer, Trump, now-Vice President J.D. Vance and some state Republicans amplified the racist lie that Haitians in Springfield were stealing their neighbors’ pets and eating them.
Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, however, defended that community and criticized those who were baselessly attacking it. 
Before last week’s ban, leaders of Ohio’s Haitian community said people were terrified because the lies about them made them a target — and because Trump canceled the temporary protected status of 500,000 Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.
All face difficult conditions in their home countries, but the situation in Haiti is particularly dire. Its last elected president was assassinated four years ago and the country has since fallen into chaos and gang violence.
On Monday, the New York Times reported on another way Trump’s latest order stands to harm Haitians. 
Brad Mertens Joseph, age 6, was to travel from Haiti to Akron Children’s Hospital for a heart surgery he needs to live past 30. Because of Trump’s travel ban, it was abruptly canceled along with medical procedures for hundreds of other Haitian children with serious medical conditions, the paper reported.
Tramonte said it’s time to stop pushing immigrants from troubled countries from one place to another.
“How many times do people from Haiti, the Congo, Cameroon, and Afghanistan have to save their own lives in order to find a safe place to call home?” she asked. “How many countries do they have to turn to before one lets them stop moving and settle in? These are some of the strongest, bravest, and smartest people I have ever known. They want to live in Ohio and are doing great things here. Ohio needs them. We would benefit from embracing them and their family members, and helping them put down permanent roots, not making them feel scared and telling them to leave.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/immigrationjan2222025-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

Trump also authorized the Pentagon to dispatch regular U.S. troops “as necessary” to support the California National Guard.

The president’s orders did not specify rules of engagement about when and how force could be used. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who did not request the National Guard and asserted it was not needed, criticized the president’s decision as “inflammatory” and warned it “will only escalate tensions.”
I am a historian who has written several books about the Vietnam War, one of the most divisive episodes in our nation’s past. My recent book, “Kent State: An American Tragedy,” examines a historic clash on May 4, 1970, between anti-war protesters and National Guard troops at Kent State University in Ohio.
The confrontation escalated into violence: troops opened fire on the demonstrators, killing four students and wounding nine others, including one who was paralyzed for life.
In my view, dispatching California National Guard troops against civilian protesters in Los Angeles chillingly echoes decisions and actions that led to the tragic Kent State shooting. Some active-duty units, as well as National Guard troops, are better prepared today than in 1970 to respond to riots and violent protests — but the vast majority of their training and their primary mission remains to fight, to kill, and to win wars.

Federalizing the Guard
The National Guard is a force of state militias under the command of governors. It can be federalized by the president during times of national emergency, or for deployment on combat missions overseas. Guardsmen train for one weekend per month and two weeks every summer.
Typically, the Guard has been deployed to deal with natural disasters and support local police responses to urban unrest. Examples include riots in Detroit in 1967, Washington DC in 1968, Los Angeles in 1965 and 1992, and Minneapolis and other cities in 2020 after the death of George Floyd.
Presidents rarely deploy National Guard troops without state governors’ consent. The main modern exceptions occurred in the 1950s and 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement, when Southern governors defied federal court orders to desegregate schools in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. In each case, the federal government sent troops to protect Black students from crowds of white protesters.
The 1807 Insurrection Act grants presidents authority to use active-duty troops or National Guard forces to restore order within the United States. President Trump did not invoke the Insurrection Act. Instead, he relied on Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, a narrower federal statute that allows the president to mobilize the National Guard in situations including “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”
Trump did not limit his order to Los Angeles. He authorized armed forces to protect immigration enforcement operations at any “locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur.”

The standoff at Kent State
The war in Vietnam had grown increasingly unpopular by early 1970, but protests intensified on April 30 when President Richard Nixon authorized expanding the conflict into Cambodia. At Kent State, after a noontime anti-war rally on campus on May 1, alcohol-fueled students harassed passing motorists in town and smashed storefront windows that night. On May 2, anti-war protesters set fire to the building where military officers trained Kent State students enrolled in the armed forces’ Reserve Officer Training Corps program.
In response, Republican Gov. Jim Rhodes dispatched National Guard troops, against the advice of university and many local officials, who understood the mood in the town of Kent and on campus far better than Rhodes did. County prosecutor Ron Kane had vehemently warned Rhodes that deploying the National Guard could spark conflict and lead to fatalities.
Nonetheless, Rhodes — who was trailing in an impending Republican primary for a U.S. Senate seat — struck the pose of a take-charge leader who wasn’t going to be pushed around by a long-haired rabble. “We’re going to put a stop to this!” he shouted, pounding the table at a press conference in Kent on May 3.
Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed across town and on campus. University officials announced that further rallies were banned. Nonetheless, on May 4, some 2,000 to 3,000 students gathered on the campus Commons for another anti-war rally. They were met by 96 National Guardsmen, led by eight officers.
There was confrontation in the air as student anger over Nixon’s expansion of the war blended with resentment over the Guard’s presence. Protesters chanted antiwar slogans, shouted epithets at the Guardsmen, and made obscene gestures.

‘Fire in the air!’
The Guardsmen sent to Kent State had no training in de-escalating tension or minimizing the use of force. Nonetheless, their commanding officer that day, Ohio Army National Guard Assistant Adjutant General Robert Canterbury, decided to use them to break up what the Department of Justice later deemed a legal assembly.
In my view, it was a reckless judgment that inflamed an already volatile situation. Students started showering the greatly outnumbered Guardsmen with rocks and other objects. In violation of Ohio Army National Guard regulations, Canterbury neglected to warn the students that he had ordered Guardsmens’ rifles loaded with live ammunition.
As tension mounted, Canterbury failed to adequately supervise his increasingly fearful troops — a cardinal responsibility of the commanding officer on the scene. This fundamental failure of leadership increased confusion and resulted in a breakdown of fire control discipline — officers’ responsibility to maintain tight control over their troops’ discharge of weapons.
When protesters neared the Guardsmen, platoon sergeant Mathew McManus shouted “Fire in the air!” in a desperate attempt to prevent bloodshed. McManus intended for troops to shoot above the students’ heads to warn them off. But some Guardsmen, wearing gas masks that made it hard to hear amid the noise and confusion, only heard or reacted to the first word of McManus’ order, and fired at the students.
The troops had not been trained to fire warning shots, which was contrary to National Guard regulations. And McManus had no authority to issue an order to fire if officers were nearby, as they were.
Many National Guardsmen who were at Kent State on May 4 later questioned why they had been deployed there. “Loaded rifles and fixed bayonets are pretty harsh solutions for students exercising free speech on an American campus,” one of them told an oral history interviewer. Another plaintively asked me in a 2023 interview, “Why would you put soldiers trained to kill on a university campus to serve a police function?”

A fighting force
National Guard equipment and training have improved significantly in the decades since Kent State. But Guardsmen are still military troops who are fundamentally trained to fight, not to control crowds.
In 2020, then-National Guard Bureau Chief General Joseph Lengyel told reporters that “the civil unrest mission is one of the most difficult and dangerous missions … in our domestic portfolio.”
In my view, the tragedy of Kent State shows how critical it is for authorities to be thoughtful in responding to protests, and extremely cautious in deploying military troops to deal with them. The application of force is inherently unpredictable, often uncontrollable, and can lead to fatal mistakes and lasting human suffering. And while protests sometimes break rules, they may not be disruptive or harmful enough to merit responding with force.
Aggressive displays of force, in fact, can heighten tensions and worsen situations. Conversely, research shows that if protesters perceive authorities are acting with restraint and treating them with respect, they are more likely to remain nonviolent. The shooting at Kent State demonstrated that using military force in these situations is an option fraught with grave risks.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)An Ohio House committee began hearings last week on a bill cracking down on utility resellers. In some developments, like apartment complexes, the building owner contracts with a utility to purchase power wholesale and then resells it to their tenants. There’s nothing wrong with that arrangement in the abstract, the sponsors of the proposed bill argue, but they say there’s little to stop a landlord from taking advantage of residents.
House bill 265
State Reps. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, and Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, are co-sponsoring House bill 265 which would treat utility resellers like utilities.
“These companies purchase bulk utility services from traditional utilities, then resell them to end users at rates of their own choosing,” Brennan argued. “They charge for service, send bills, impose late fees and even disconnect customers, but unlike utilities regulated by the PUCO, they’re subject to virtually no oversight.”
Subjecting resellers to the same regulatory expectations as utilities would require them to justify rates and follow existing rules for billing, complaint resolution, and disconnection. The changes could also give customers access to conservation or assistance programs.
Fischer made a free-market case for the bill. He said a competitive market will produce the lowest prices, but competition relies on a level playing field.
Ohio’s existing energy market where customers can easily switch to different suppliers has saved customers “nearly $37 billion since 2011,” Fischer said. But utility resellers can hive off a set of customers and lock them into rates they didn’t chose.
“This is a problem,” Fischer said. “It cannot be the case that a competitive energy market has a third-party entity creating a monopoly on certain consumers by removing the choice we are seeking to empower them with.”

Committee questions
Brennan and Fischer’s isn’t the only proposal attempting to address the utility resellers.
State Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, introduced House bill 173 which he described as “equal parts clarity and consumer protection.”
Unlike Brennan and Fischer’s proposal, Thomas would not subject resellers to the same scrutiny as utilities, but the bill explicitly prohibits resellers from charging more than the standard consumer rate.
In committee, Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, asked Brennan and Fischer to elaborate on the differences between the two bills’ approach.
“I think that would create a separate regulatory framework for submetering,” Fischer said. “Whereas our approach is simply to more or less plug those existing submetering companies into the existing public utility regulatory climate.”
State Rep. Beth Lear, R-Galena, sounded skeptical. If more regulations lead to higher prices, she said, how will subjecting resellers to new regulations lower prices?
“Because I would think that in general, it would be good for a lot of folks to be able to have their own individual bill, which I think is kind of the purpose of submetering,” she said.
And Lear seemed concerned about landlords deciding to stick with bulk utility purchasing and burying the cost in tenants’ rent.
“I’m just trying to understand how this is more fair than that,” she said, “and (how it) is going to save money and not cost people more.”
Fischer agreed with Lear’s baseline assumption that regulations can inflate costs. But in a monopoly market, he said, those assumptions break down. It’s not a good idea to have several companies competing to put up power lines to your home, he said, but without that competition, regulations are one of the few guardrails available to rein in prices.
Fischer insisted their legislation isn’t meant to eliminate submetering. “I think there’s a lot of value in the concept,” he insisted, but resellers shouldn’t be operating in a kind of “no man’s land.”
“Although under current law, it’s not considered utility it functions in a very similar way, if not the exact same way,” Fischer said. “So, what we’re looking to do is to kind of add transparency and add a little bit of accountability to that process to make sure that there are not folks getting overcharged.”

(Getty Images.)This story was originally published by Canary Media. 

A decade ago, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups, trade organizations, and companies found themselves in a regulatory standoff with American Electric Power over operating costs for six coal-fired power plants in Ohio.


The utility’s opponents objected to letting the company collect more money from customers to keep the unprofitable plants running, while the utility argued the charges were a hedge against even higher costs.


Before state regulators made a decision, the utility and some of its opponents announced a compromise. As part of the deal, the Sierra Club would drop its opposition in exchange for AEP’s commitment to add more solar and wind to its portfolio as well as move up its timeline for closing or converting several coal plants to natural gas.


A Sierra Club representative at the time described it as ​“nowhere near a perfect deal” but as one that would significantly reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the state’s clean energy transition.


Such compromises will now be prohibited in Ohio under a new state law that forbids settlements involving the closure of ​“base load” power plants.


Proponents of House Bill 15, signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in mid-May, say it will support the state’s ever-growing power needs and promote competition within its energy sector.


Yet critics are questioning the law’s definition of ​“base load” generating facilities: It only covers electricity sources that run primarily on nonrenewable fuels such as natural gas or nuclear. The definition excludes wind or solar power, even when combined with battery storage.


 Utility settlements have been a part of regulatory process

Negotiating special deals in settlements has long been common in utility regulatory cases. Industry groups or companies have gotten discounts and other benefits in return for dropping opposition to utilities’ added charges. Parties in court cases often settle before trial, too.


For example, the same year that the Sierra Club reached a settlement with AEP, a trade group representing industrial customers negotiated a special rate with FirstEnergy’s Ohio utilities in exchange for dropping opposition to a customer-funded bailout of that company’s unprofitable coal and nuclear plants. (The secret terms of that agreement were part of a criminal case filed last year against Ohio’s former chief utility regulator, Sam Randazzo. They also became part of a House Bill 6-related regulatory case on which regulators will finally hear evidence this month.)


HB 15 will still allow settlements with special deals, as long as terms are part of the public record, there’s no cash payment, and they do not close or limit ​“base load” electricity-generating facilities.


Neil Waggoner, who heads the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign for the Midwest region, suspects the provision is likely a backlash to the environmental group’s 2015 settlement with AEP.


That deal didn’t end up delivering all of the expected clean energy benefits. State rules requiring wind turbines to be a certain distance from other properties ultimately made it impossible for AEP to add the planned 500 megawatts of wind generation, and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio refused to allow the utility to charge customers the cost of building 400 MW of solar energy.

The ​“base load” provisions weren’t part of HB 15 as it originally passed the House, nor were they in the initial versions of the companion Senate bill, SB 2. The language appeared in a substitute version of SB 2 introduced on March 11, the same day that Ed Spiker, chair of the Ohio Coal Association, submitted written testimony pleading the state to enact ​“guardrails to ensure current coal power plants are not forced to close.”


The terms used in SB 2 included natural gas and nuclear in the definition of a ​“base load electric generating facility” but not renewables. The Senate then added the provisions to HB 15 before passing it this spring.


Law reflects desire to protect fossil fuels and nuclear
The law suggests Republicans’ continuing willingness to prop up conventional power plants, even when their electricity may cost more than cleaner sources of power.


“How would you replace base load power generation, given the amount of megawatts that they produce that we certainly require?” Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, challenged one witness who spoke against nuclear power plants during a March 11 hearing held by the Senate Energy Committee.


Yet electricity from coal and nuclear plants remains relatively expensive, compared to that from renewables or natural gas.


Ashley Brown, a former state utility regulator, questioned the constitutionality of the new settlement restrictions. ​“I don’t know how they can tell somebody you can’t shut down a plant,” he told Canary Media.


Two weeks ago, the Trump administration ordered a retiring Michigan coal plant to stay open, although it’s unclear whether the mandate will face a court challenge. Separately, regional grid operator PJM Interconnection has sometimes issued orders to keep power-generation facilities running to maintain grid reliability, as it did for former FirstEnergy coal plants. In that case, however, the company was paid to keep the plants open.


Waggoner noted that HB 15’s language only applies to settlements. Its terms wouldn’t stop a company from closing an unprofitable plant on its own accord.


HB 15 also finally revokes subsidies for two 1950s-era coal plants, which had been put in place by HB 6, the 2019 law at the heart of an ongoing public corruption scandal in Ohio. Yet Beth Nagusky, an adjunct law professor at Case Western Reserve University, wonders whether the provision preventing settlements that close ​“base load” power plants is meant to lay the groundwork for new subsidies down the road for nuclear and coal plants, which might become involved in regulatory or judicial cases.


“I don’t think that’s even being hidden,” Waggoner said. Along the same lines, environmental groups have criticized laws from 2023 and 2024 that include natural gas and nuclear power in the state’s definition of ​“green energy.”


As Waggoner sees it, utilities and policymakers who claim to be worried about maintaining enough ​“base load” or ​“dispatchable” electricity are concerned less about real reliability issues and more about minimizing the importance of renewable energy in the face of climate change, even when renewables are paired with storage.


“They’re looking at how do you frame this argument so you’re not just saying, ​‘We don’t want renewables,’” Waggoner said. ​“They’re trying to find a way to justify what they want, as opposed to what the moment demands.”

(Jill Hummels for Kansas Reflector)My high school class from South Haven has a group text where we share things going all the way back to a time when the world was so different than is the case today.
Yes, that was longer ago than all of us probably want to admit, and my classmates and I have certainly been around the blocks of life between then, and now. I am often reminded of a classic Jim Croce song, “Photographs and Memories,” when I think of our group.
Recently, one of my classmates posted that he was going to retire from farming and that this would be his last wheat harvest. I remarked that the moment was most likely going to be bittersweet. His decision caused me to think about some of the things that shape us and guide us through the inevitable challenges of life.


When the time came for me to go to college (the University of Kansas), and then on to law school, leading up to the start of my career as a Wall Street lawyer and investment banker, I made a vow to my parents. I promised that in addition to normal periodic visits for the various holidays during the year, I would always return for the wheat harvest.
And so I did. One day, it was the pinstriped suit in New York. The next day it was overalls and a John Deere cap.
I spent that time on a John Deere model 95 combine with a 16 foot header. Air conditioned? Of course — there was nothing like that 20 mph hot wind out of the southwest coating me with chaff. GPS guidance? Hell, yes. My left eye and my right eye could keep a pretty straight line in our fields on the family farm. We harvested around 50 acres on a good day, and my dad would take the wheat to the elevator in Rome with his 1950 Chevy truck, filled to the gills with about 200 bushels.
None of this was work. It was pure joy. My colleagues at the law firm no doubt wondered why on God’s green earth I would want to leave a climate-controlled office, and a pretty comfortable lifestyle, for the heat and dust of a Kansas wheat field.
The answer was simple. It was coming home. Those memories will remain with me forever. Now, we harvest wheat fields on other farms that stretch to the horizon, and then some. Now, we sit in air-conditioned cabs and use GPS mapping to guide us through the fields. But what remains unchanged is the connection to the land. It is a source of comfort, especially in troubled times.
There are some lines in a great Van Morrison song, “Someone Like You,” where he talks about being “up and down the highway in all kinds of foreign lands,” and being “all around the world marching to the beat of a different drum.” Those words fit me pretty well.
That said, my heart has always been in those Kansas wheat fields, and they help me to have a perspective on today’s world. That connection to the land is a bond that will never be broken.

Not mine and maybe not yours, but they are an explicit manifesto of the “values” most prized by the controlling party. 
The federal budget bill and the one being hammered out in Ohio both put a premium on corporate welfare, as opposed to social safety nets, and the continued prosperity of fat cats who write big campaign checks, as opposed to everyone else. 
Federal lawmakers — more fearful of upsetting their Dear Leader than screwing their constituents out of healthcare and food aid — are doubling-down to enact a $2.4 trillion-dollar operating budget with unpaid tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the ultra-wealthy and corporations while millions go hungry and lose medical insurance. 
Besides the moral depravity of kicking the working-class poor to the curb to reward multi-millionaires and billionaires with lavish tax breaks, this deficit-ballooning monstrosity is predicted to explode the national debt to more than $50 trillion within ten years. 
The so-called deficit hawks who howl about paid-for spending budgets that increase revenue, reduce federal deficits, and reverse the unsustainable trajectory of today’s roughly $29 trillion in public debt, will ram through the Trump’s country club giveaway to the rich. They will vote for what the felon-in-chief (corruptly enriching himself on an epic scale) values above all else — money and power — while bankrupting the country, leaving 11 million Americans uninsured, and forcing countless families to ration meals. 
Trump supporters will lose what keeps them afloat, but what matters to the congressional invertebrates who represent them is only what matters to their amoral god king. They will spurn the many who struggle to survive to indulge the few who luxuriate in multiple homes and on super yachts. 
While sparse food banks turn away seniors on the edge of poverty and mothers desperate to stave off their children’s hunger, the richest Americans will walk away richer, thanks to one party that prioritizes the interests of zillionaires and modern-day robber barons to maintain political dominance.

Ohio Republicans are using the same playbook as their federal counterparts to hand the wealthiest Ohioans a billion-dollar handout by lowering the state income tax on those making six figures plus with a single flat rate for everybody. But less than 3% of this tax cut would go to the bottom 80% of working Ohioans, according to Policy Matters Ohio. 
A tax expert with the nonpartisan research group testified that the other 97% “goes to Ohioans in the top 20% of earners, making at least $139,000” while the top 1% alone (with an average income of over $1.7 million) rakes in 40% of the tax cut benefits.  
So much for equity in a regressive tax code proposal that eliminates graduated brackets for the gated community to pay a higher share of its considerable income. 
Who cares if Ohio’s general revenue fund takes a 1.1 billion hit in lost revenue as a result? State lawmakers’ rational for their fiscally irresponsible tax cuts to the mega-rich is identical to the one congressional Republicans offer for the bulk of their tax cuts going to the richest households and greediest corporations. 
It’s the old, punctured “trickle-down theory” that pretends fat cats with fatter wallets ignite economic growth. Proof to the contrary is abundant.
So is evidence that subsidizing billionaire owners of sports teams with public money to build multi-billion-dollar stadiums is a bad bet for taxpayers. But that hasn’t stopped leading Republicans in the Ohio Senate and Ohio House from bending over backward to accommodate Jimmy and Dee Haslams’ ask for $600 million to take the Browns out of a perfectly good stadium on the lakefront and plop a new one into a working-class suburb right next to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. The pols bow to the Haslams as deep-pocketed Republican donors and are committed to finding some way to finance the couple’s private interests with public funds. 
But the party that engineered gerrymandered supermajorities in the legislature and exerts absolute rule in Ohio insists the state can’t find any extra money for food banks (reeling from deep funding cuts under the Trump regime) and has unified around slashing food bank funding by nearly 25% despite rising demand across Ohio. 
Republicans also argue that fully funding public education in the state — under a bipartisan spending formula that came closest to meeting long ignored constitutional obligations — is not sustainable under a tight budget. But swelling state investments in a voucher boondoggle predicted to cost $1.25 billion by 2027, according to the Columbus Dispatch, to offset tuition costs for affluent families who can afford the private schools their darlings already attend is sustainable??
Statehouse Republicans blame budget constraints for cutbacks on opioid recovery programs, public libraries, public transit, safe drinking water initiatives, continued Medicaid coverage for kids up to age 3, and even no-cost breakfast and lunch for all Ohio students. 
They punted on property tax relief with clawbacks from fiscally responsible school districts yet managed to remove all elected members of the state education board in the Ohio House budget bill. 
But cash for brand new stadiums, a billion-dollar tax cut for the wealthy, and an open government spigot for expanded private school vouchers? Those are GOP priorities that value money and power above all else.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0055-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-12 23:11:00.370503

A list of “sanctuary” jurisdictions accused of failing to cooperate with immigration arrests, including the state of Colorado, was taken down after protests about its accuracy. (Photo by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A list of 14 states, 298 counties and 200 cities deemed immigration sanctuaries by the Trump administration has disappeared from a government website but continues to hang over the heads of officials who face threats of losing federal funding.
“We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause,” said Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, North Carolina, a heavily Democratic county that nevertheless complies with a new state law requiring cooperation with immigration arrests.
“The list is gone. Am I satisfied that it was rectified? Yes. Am I satisfied that it’s over? No,” Blackwood said.
The list went up May 29. It called out the “cities, counties, and states that are deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.” The White House had already threatened “suspension or termination” of federal funds to them.
Along with counties and cities, the list named the whole states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia as “state sanctuary” areas.










We were placed on a list with many other sheriffs across the nation for no clear reason and no clear cause.


– Sheriff Charles Blackwood of Orange County, N.C.


There was immediate reaction from some areas, not only Democratic states and counties with court-tested legal policies of declining cooperation with deportation, but also conservative areas mystified by their inclusion.
“We figure it must be some kind of mix-up. We certainly support our fellow law enforcement agencies,” said James Davel, administrative coordinator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, which was included despite no apparent immigration sanctuary policy. The county voted for President Donald Trump in 2024 by more than 67%.
One possible explanation: The county board passed a resolution in 2021 declaring Shawano a “Second Amendment Sanctuary County” as a sign of “vigorous support of the peoples’ Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.”
States are telling sheriffs whether they can — or can’t — work with ICE

The list disappeared from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website in a matter of days, after the National Sheriffs’ Association complained that many counties were erroneously included.
“It was quite the debacle,” said sheriffs’ association spokesperson Patrick Royal. “We are working with the administration to resolve as much as we can.”
But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a television appearance that the list would come back and was largely accurate.
“That list is absolutely continuing to be used and it is going to be identifying those cities and those jurisdictions that aren’t honoring law and justice,” Noem said in a Fox News interview June 1.
Courts have so far upheld local laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration arrests. California won a lawsuit on the issue in 2017 under the first Trump administration, and the same federal judge issued an injunction saying federal funds couldn’t be withheld on the basis of immigration cooperation during a new trial on the issue.
The national sheriffs’ association president, Sheriff Kieran Donahue of Canyon County, Idaho, said in a May 31 statement that the list “was created without any input, criteria of compliance, or a mechanism for how to object to the designation.” He said it was “an unfortunate and unnecessary erosion of unity and collaboration with law enforcement.” Canyon County was not on the list, though the city of Boise was.
For-profit immigration detention expands as Trump accelerates his deportation plans

The pushback from sheriffs was a sign of how seriously flawed the list was, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
“The real problem is, how are they defining sanctuary?” Putzel-Kavanaugh said. “To have pushback from an association that is typically quite supportive of this administration and their agenda points to problems with definition.”
Watauga County, North Carolina, was on the list when it first appeared May 29 but came off before it was taken down. The county’s congressional representative, Republican Virginia Foxx, said in a Facebook post that she intervened.
In the post, Foxx called it “a mistake … made during the Biden administration that resulted in Watauga County being listed incorrectly as a sanctuary county.” She also said that “Watauga County is no longer listed” after she “contacted DHS.”
Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group favoring less immigration, said her list of sanctuary jurisdictions included Watauga based on a June 2024 report from U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement listing it as among hundreds of others as “non-cooperative institutions.”
Even sanctuary policies can’t stop ICE arrests

Vaughan said data she requested from ICE shows some counties in North Carolina were still not complying with all detainers this year through early February, but Watauga is not one of them.
“They should probably come off the list,” she said. “None of those sheriffs has contacted me about reviewing their policies or taking them off the map. I would be happy to do so, and have done so frequently with sheriffs in other states.”
Sheriff Len Hagaman of Watauga County told Stateline via email that he had contacted federal immigration officials and confirmed that his county, which voted Democratic for president last year by a 52% to 46% margin, had a solid record of cooperating with immigration arrests.
Hagaman alluded to an April Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, calling out Watauga and eight other North Carolina counties as immigration sanctuaries.
“For several weeks now, I, along with other North Carolina sheriffs have had to endure gross and inaccurate misinformation regarding false allegations,” Hagaman wrote.

Stanley Dunlap/Georgia RecorderThree elected state regulators are being asked to recuse themselves from voting on a proposed agreement to freeze Georgia Power’s rates over allegations that they violated state rules by publicly endorsing the proposal before an upcoming hearing.
Advocacy groups filed a complaint Friday accusing Georgia Public Service Commission Chairman Jason Shaw, Commissioner Lauren “Bubba” McDonald and Commissioner Tim Echols of showing bias by supporting a proposal between commission staff and Georgia Power that would freeze the base electric rates from 2026 to 2028.
Shaw and McDonald are accused of violating state regulations by publicly endorsing the proposed three-year rate freeze during Gov. Brian Kemp’s May press conference, which promoted the proposal.
According to the complaint, state rules require commissioners to reserve their opinions on the merits of a matter until they have heard all the facts following a hearing.
The four nonprofits behind the complaint – Georgians for Affordable Energy, Georgia Conservation Voters, Center for a Sustainable Coast, and Georgia Women’s Action for New Directions – recommend that the commission cancel or deny the proposed rate freeze, which would result in a Georgia Power rate case later this year. Another option they floated would be to have an administrative law judge appointed to rule on the base rate plan.
Patty Durand, founder of Georgians for Affordable Energy, said the commission should deny the rate freeze plan and instead require Georgia Power to hold its normal three-year rate case this fall that she said could result in ratepayers paying lower utility bills. That would also give regulators a chance to review the utility’s commission-approved profit margin, which is currently set at 11.9%.
“Georgia Power’s three-year rate freeze is a Trojan horse and absolutely devastating to Georgia Power ratepayers,” Durand said. “They don’t do this out of benevolence. They’re a for-profit corporation always seeking to increase profits. This three-year rate freeze does that by locking in high profits through a return on equity that is far above industry norms and delivers $700 million in excess profits annually.”
The complaint also refers to a quote from Echols in a May 27 Atlanta Journal-Constitution article about the proposed rate freeze.
“Freezing the rates for three years is the best thing we can do for ratepayers right now, and I have advocated for that incessantly,” Echols said in the article while discussing discount utility programs for seniors and low-income ratepayers.
The three commissioners declined to comment on the pending complaint through a commission spokesperson.

At the May press conference, Shaw said that freezing rates for “three years is a very big deal for our state, and it’s good for Georgians.”
“At the end of the day, we’re going to have an open and transparent process hearing of this agreement,” Shaw also said. “We’re going to have a chance over the next few weeks to meet with all the stakeholders. If anyone has concerns about this agreement, we’re going to sit down as we learn more about it ourselves, and have that normal open dialog that we have at the PSC.”
Several consumer and environmental groups have expressed concerns regarding the timing of the rate freeze announcement and May press conference. Early voting for the June 17 primary election featuring two commission seats started a week after the press conference. Echols is the only commissioner named in the complaint who is up for reelection this year.
Early voting ends Friday as Democratic candidates Peter Hubbard, Robert Jones, Keisha Sean Waites and Daniel Blackman run for the Public Service Commission against appointed Republican Commissioner Fitz Johnson in the Nov. 4 general election.
Blackman is still fighting to stay on the ballot, though. A Fulton County Superior Court hearing is scheduled for Tuesday to hear Blackman’s appeal after being disqualified for the Atlanta-based seat for failing to meet residency requirements.
Georgia voters will also decide this month who will win the GOP primary for the District 2 race that covers eastern Georgia as Republican Commissioner Tim Echols faces challenger Lee Muns. The winner of the District 2 Republican primary will face Savannah Democratic candidate Alicia M. Johnson in the general election.
The commission has come under fire for approving six Georgia Power rate hikes since late 2022 that have resulted in the typical household paying about $43 more per month on their electric bills.
And bills could still increase, even with the rate freeze. Next year, Georgia Power will file cases with the commission seeking to recoup storm damage and overrun fuel expenses from customers.
Georgia Power spokesman John Kraft said that the proposed agreement will balance the company’s ability to provide affordable rates to customers while also supporting the growing demands from new customers.
State regulators commissioners also adopted a rule earlier this year that requires large-use customers to pay their full electric service costs through Georgia Power.
“We’re always working to keep energy reliable and affordable for customers, and this stipulated agreement means no base rate increases for three years – that’s great news for every customer,” Kraft said. “Reaching this agreement was just the start of an open and transparent process, leading up to a vote by the Georgia PSC, which will include opportunities for comment and input from intervenors and the public.”
