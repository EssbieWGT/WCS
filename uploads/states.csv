(Image via Maine Legislature live stream)The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday granted an injunction overruling the Maine House of Representatives’ decision to block Maine Rep. Laurel Libby from voting or speaking on the chamber floor after she was censured for posting personal information about a transgender student on her legislative Facebook page.
In a statement, the Republican from Auburn said the ruling was “a victory not just for my constituents, but for the Constitution itself.”
“The Supreme Court has affirmed what should never have been in question — that no state legislature has the power to silence an elected official simply for speaking truthfully about issues that matter,” she said. 
Libby has been barred from speaking on the chamber floor since late February, when the House voted 75-70 along party lines in favor of the censure, which would have ended if the legislator apologized to the body, which she has declined to do. 
Libby petitioned the high court last month after the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure, which she argued disenfranchised her constituents. 
The ruling was issued by the so-called “shadow docket,” which is traditionally how the court handles procedural matters and does not involve extensive hearings or arguments, and the decisions often come with little-to-no explanation. There was no opinion issued in Libby’s favor. 
However, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson penned a dissenting opinion, arguing that the case raised a number of important questions about the rights of state legislatures to enforce its rules that the court “neither addressed nor answered.” She also questioned whether Libby’s appeal actually warranted emergency relief. 
“Not very long ago, this Court treaded carefully with respect to exercising its equitable power to issue injunctive relief at the request of a party claiming an emergency,” Jackson wrote. “Those days are no more. Today’s Court barely pauses to acknowledge these important threshold limitations on the exercise of its own authority. It opts instead to dole out error correction as it sees fit, regardless of the lack of any exigency and even when the applicants’ claims raise significant legal issues that warrant thorough evaluation by the lower courts that are dutifully considering them.”
“Also, as a practical matter, it is plainly prudent to reserve our emergency docket for applicants who demonstrate that they truly need our help now,” Jackson added.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor also said she would have denied the application.
The Facebook post at the heart of the dispute is credited with kicking off a firestorm that has since led to the U.S. Department of Justice suing Maine over its protections for transgender students. 
Days after Libby’s viral post, which contained the name and image of a transgender student athlete, President Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from the state for not complying with his executive order seeking to ban transgender women from competing in sports that correspond with their gender identity.

SPRINGFIELD — A bill to ban the sale of firefighter protective gear containing “forever chemicals” is gaining momentum in the Illinois General Assembly, as lawmakers, union leaders and firefighters themselves warn that the very equipment designed to save lives may be silently endangering them.

House Bill 2409, co-sponsored by Rep. Mike Kelly, D-Chicago, and Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, seeks to expand on the state’s existing PFAS Reduction Act by targeting a lesser-addressed but critical source of firefighter exposure to these harmful substances: their turnout gear.

Turnout gear, also known as bunker gear, is the specialized protective clothing worn by firefighters to protect them when they respond to fires or other hazardous situations.

“We know the damage that PFAs can do to our bodies,” Kelly said in an interview. “While this is supposed to protect us, it’s doing us serious harm.”

PFAS have long been used to make products -resistant to water, heat and staining, but research has increasingly linked them to serious health issues, including multiple forms of cancer. According to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization trying to protect environmental health through better industry standards, PFAS were first added to firefighters’ personal protective equipment in 1976.

The bill is backed by the Associated Firefighters of Illinois, a statewide union representing more than 17,000 firefighters and paramedics in 237 communities. Advocates argue that the legislation is crucial in addressing the leading cause of death among firefighters today—chronic illnesses such as cancer.

“Little did we know that the bunker gear, the very gear that is supposed to protect us, to keep us safe, is actually killing us,” AFFI President and retired firefighter Chuck Sullivan said. PFAS are known as “forever chemicals” because they can stay in the human body a long time.

Numerous scientific studies from the American Cancer Society, National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate the correlation between exposure to PFAS and the increased number of firefighters developing various forms of cancer. Kelly and Villavalam cited this research as the impetus driving the legislation.

Sullivan said the Illinois bill closely follows similar legislation passed in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Connecticut. Under HB 2409, manufacturers would be banned from selling gear containing PFAS in Illinois after Jan. 1, 2027. In the interim, labeling requirements would take effect beginning in 2026. Fire departments would be mandated to phase out affected equipment, such as self-contained breathing apparatuses or certain rescue harnesses, by 2030.

“When we put our gear on, it's not on the forefront of our mind that that is also dangerous and also giving us additional exposures,” Steve Shetsky, a member of AFFI’s executive board, said. “So this bill would absolutely limit those exposures, which would make this profession safer.”

Retired Chicago Fire Department Lieutenant Jim Tracy knows the risk firsthand. Diagnosed with colon cancer six years ago, he endured chemotherapy, radiation and surgery to eradicate the cancer he blames on the uniform.

“I was 22 years in the field when I got diagnosed,” Tracy said. “It is unfortunately one of those cancers you get from PFAS.”

Tracy, who spent 28 years working as a firefighter, said it was only recently that they received one set of gear that is “99% PFAS free.” The new equipment was delayed in production, he said, because manufacturers had to remove PFAS-laced materials from collars and cuffs and replace them with 100% cotton. Many firefighters, however, still wear older gear that is laden with forever chemicals.

“Personal protective equipment,” Tracy said. “It’s not very protective if it is giving us cancer.”

In addition to his own health battle, Tracy said he has many colleagues in the department who have gotten sick but do not report their illnesses out of fear of losing their jobs.

“They don’t want to get kicked off the job, so they go through it on their own and don’t tell the department,” he said.

‘Financial unknowns, replacements under testing’

HB 2409 passed the House 114-0 on April 10.  It passed a Senate committee unanimously and is awaiting final action on the Senate floor before it can head to Gov. JB Pritzker for a signature.

Despite bipartisan support in both legislative chambers, the Illinois Fire Chiefs Association has been vocal in its opposition to the bill, citing concerns about the availability and cost of compliant gear.

John Buckley, executive director of the IFCA, testified before the Senate Labor Committee on May 6, urging lawmakers to amend the bill to delay the enforcement date.

“Our ask and our solution to the problem was to move the date from Jan. 1, 2027, to Jan. 1, 2029 — to give two years to determine if gear would be available and meet the needs of the firefighters in Illinois,” Buckley said.

While Buckley emphasized that the IFCA supports eradicating PFAS from firefighter gear, he warned that the current timeline does not allow enough time for departments to identify, test and purchase safe alternatives, which he said are not affordable or readily accessible.

“Currently, nothing’s been tested and vetted that meets that requirement,” he said. “The gear that’s out there that is PFAS-free is in very limited use, and some of it does not meet national standards,” Buckley said.





Buckley also pointed out that the proposed legislation lacks a funding mechanism to help departments cover the cost of new gear, which he said could “range from $4,000 to $5,000 per set.”

According to the Office of the Illinois State Fire Marshal, the state has 39,564 firefighters. Outfitting each with PFAS-free equipment could cost between $158 million and $198 million—a significant expense as Illinois faces a tightening budget picture for fiscal year 2026.

Still, sponsors said protecting firefighters from potentially deadly chemical exposure should take precedence over its price tag and logistical concerns.

“Our first responders deserve to work with equipment and clothing that does not pose a risk to their health,” Villivalam said. “This measure ensures they are able to continue to be protected while doing their work effectively.”

Even if HB 2409 becomes law, Buckley said he plans to continue pushing for a 2029 effective date when the 104th General Assembly reconvenes in January 2026.

Mike Kehoe and First Lady Claudia Kehoe take a moment by the casket of Christopher S. “Kit” Bond during a memorial service Tuesday the Missouri State Capitol rotunda (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri said goodbye Tuesday to Kit Bond, the Republican former governor, U.S. Senator and auditor who spent 34 of his 86 years in public office.
During a memorial service in the Missouri Capitol Building’s rotunda, Bond was eulogized by John Ashcroft, the Republican who succeeded him in office as governor, and U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who said the two formed a lifelong friendship during Bond’s first term as governor from 1973 to 1977.
 Kit Bond’s portrait in the Hall of Governor’s is marked by a black band to memorialize his death (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
“Talk is cheap, but doing takes the devotion of one’s lifetime,” Ashcroft said. “Bond was a doer.”
Cleaver said he first met Bond as a civil rights leader, and the friendship was cemented during his time as mayor of Kansas City and when he was elected to Congress in 2004. 
On Cleaver’s arrival in Washington, Bond, starting his fourth term in the Senate, held a reception for the freshman Democrat. They worked together to restore the Liberty Memorial, obtain funds for a new courthouse and find money for bridge and road projects, Cleaver said.
“I will be delighted for the rest of my life to have worked with Kit Bond,” Cleaver said.
The hour-long ceremony also featured prayers from former U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth, an Episcopal priest who, along with Bond and Ashcroft, were the young Republican leaders who broke a Democratic monopoly on state offices in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Bond’s casket will remain in the rotunda until 1 p.m. Wednesday, when he will be taken to St. Louis for a family memorial service and private interment.
Bond died May 13 and was survived by his wife of 22 years, Linda Holwick Bond, and his son, Samuel.
Bond grew up in Mexico, Missouri, the grandson of the founder of A.P. Green Industries, a fireclay manufacturer and a major employer at the time. He attended a boarding school in Massachusetts, Princeton University as an undergraduate and studied law in Virginia, practicing law in Washington, D.C., until he returned home in 1967. 
Bond lost a bid for Congress in 1968 before winning the race for state auditor in 1970. When he was elected governor in 1972 at the age of 33, he was — and remains — the youngest person ever to win the state’s highest office.
In 2020, veteran journalist Phill Brooks, who covered both Bond administrations for KMOX and the University of Missouri School of Journalism, wrote that Bond won office in 1972 by campaigning on a platform to restrict special interest influence in government.
“His victory empowered him to lead the successful, bipartisan legislative effort for campaign and lobbyist disclosure requirements, as well as the state’s ‘Sunshine Law’ requiring public access to government meetings and records,” Brooks wrote.
In his first term, Bond also won passage of stronger consumer protection laws and, in 1975, issued an executive order rescinding former Gov. Lilburn Boggs’ 1838 order that Mormons “must be exterminated or driven from the state.”
Bond also reorganized state government, taking it from 96 independent agencies to 14 state departments organized along lines of responsibility such as health, education and corrections.
After losing a bid for re-election, Bond made a political comeback in 1980, winning the governor’s office again. He won his seat in the U.S. Senate in 1986 and was re-elected three times.
 Officers place the casket of former U.S. Senator and Gov. Christopher S. “Kit” Bond in the Missouri State Capitol rotunda Tuesday to begin a memorial service (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The turnout Tuesday, which filled the rotunda for the 45-minute memorial service, included former governors Bob Holden and Mike Parson, former U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, people who had worked with Bond in Jefferson City and Washington, and current officials elected since he left office in 2010.
Warren Erdman, executive vice president-administration and corporate affairs for Kansas City Southern railway, was Bond’s chief of staff in his U.S. Senate office and an aide to Bond in his second term as governor. He said Bond embodied the spirit of the early Pilgrims, who founded a society, described by John Winthrop in 1630, as one of “communal charity, affection and unity.”
“Kit loved and practiced these beliefs throughout his lifetime and in his public service,” Erdmann said. “They were foundational to his approach to public service.”
In his second term as governor, Bond had to deal with state budget shortfalls as the economy weakened. He promoted and won passage of a $600 million construction bond issue to boost employment and renew state facilities.
As a senator, Bond became known for his work on the Senate Intelligence Committee, his commitment to national defense and, as illustrated by buildings like the Christopher S. Bond Life Sciences Center at the University of Missouri, the source of earmarked federal funds for local projects.
When his son was born, Bond was introduced to the program for parental guidance of education that became known as Parents as Teachers. 
“I think that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export,” Bond said in an oral history interview in 2014. “We believe that when you advocate Parents as Teachers, you are telling people across the country that Parents as Teachers is Missouri’s greatest export.”
In that same interview, Bond said “the job of governor was one of the most satisfying jobs I’ve ever had.”
 Former U.S. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft speaks at a memorial service honoring U.S. Senator and Governor Christopher S. “Kit” Bond in the Missouri State Capitol rotunda Tuesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Bond’s 1972 victory energized new leaders to go into public service, Ashcroft said in his eulogy.
“Over and over again. Kit launched the careers of young people, talented, committed, dedicated people who later, after appointment, found opportunity beckoning them to achievement levels they had not anticipated,” Ashcroft said.
Danforth, who has parted ways with Republicans over many issues in recent years, said Bond made state government better and enjoyed doing it.
“He elevated the quality of government,” Danforth said. “And besides that, in his day, politics was fun. I don’t think it’s fun anymore.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052025_kitbond12-1024x667.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

The family of the late James Joseph Foster Jr. is suing the City of Sioux City, Sioux City Fire and Rescue, the Sioux City Police Department and 10 of their employees in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit claims that in the early hours of Aug. 18, 2023, a Sioux City police officer responded to a call about Foster, who was sitting or lying along the curb of a deserted residential street. Foster told the responding officer he had injured his arm, and eventually eight people from the police department and Sioux City Fire and Rescue responded.
According to the lawsuit, the 26-year-old Foster “never posed any threat” to the responders and was instead acting disoriented and fearful, repeatedly moving away from them.

At one point, paramedic Deanna LaMere allegedly decided the situation called for the use of a chemical restraint in the form of the incapacitating drug ketamine. With the assistance of other responders, Foster was “held down and injected against his will,” the lawsuit claims. “However, instead of injecting him with ketamine, LaMere injected him with a lethal dose of the paralytic medication rocuronium,” the lawsuit states.
The lawsuit claims body-cam footage shows Foster soon was gasping for air while asking, “Am I gonna die?” and repeatedly crying, “I can’t breathe.”
“You’re not gonna die, you’re fine,” Sioux City Police Officer Alan Schmeckpeper allegedly replied.  
“LaMere realized that she had given the incorrect and life-threatening medication rocuronium, but she did not notify anyone, nor did she take any action to protect his airway and/or intubate him before he became paralyzed and unable to breathe,” the lawsuit states. “Not a single person on-scene mentioned Mr. Foster’s objectively obvious respiratory distress and, instead, police officers handcuffed the chemically incapacitated Mr. Foster and strapped him to a gurney.”
Minutes later, Foster lay motionless with his eyes open and one of the individuals on scene told him, “Night-night,” the lawsuit claims.
In an ambulance en route to a hospital, Foster’s heart stopped and LaMere allegedly called ahead and falsely reported Foster had been given a dose of ketamine. Upon their arrival at the hospital, the lawsuit alleges, LaMere “finally informed medical personnel that she had injected him with rocuronium. She then continued her clumsy cover-up when she improperly disposed of the vials of rocuronium and ketamine in a sharps container in contravention of Sioux City Fire and Rescue’s policies and procedures.”
Foster died two days later, allegedly from an anoxic brain injury due to the administration of rocuronium, according to the lawsuit.
Criminal charge filed in the case
The lawsuit claims LaMere falsely recorded in an incident report that she had conducted an advanced life support assessment of Foster when she arrived on scene, although body-cam footage reportedly shows that this was never done. LaMere also is alleged to have falsely recorded that she and her EMT partner had verified the correct dose of the injection administered to Foster,
In addition, the lawsuit alleges LaMere “had one or more incidents similar to the one at issue in this lawsuit that she was not properly disciplined, retrained or dismissed and her employment continued despite her previous failures endangering multiple patients.”
The lawsuit seeks compensation for past and future economic losses and funeral and medical expenses, plus punitive damages. The city has yet to file a response to the allegations, and a representative of the city’s legal department declined on Tuesday to comment on the case.
The individual Sioux City employees named as defendants in the case include LaMere, Drake Carnahan, Dustin L. Johnson, Brandon R. DeRocher, Jordan Reinders, Jim Haden and Randall Wood of Sioux City Fire and Rescue, as well as Schmeckpeper, Carolina Ochoa and Donette Sassman of the Sioux City Police Department.
Separate from the civil lawsuit, court records show that on Jan. 16, 2025, LaMere was criminally charged with involuntary manslaughter and that she entered a not-guilty plea on Feb. 3, 2025.
According to an affidavit filed by Assistant Woodbury County Attorney Loan Hensley, LaMere realized her error when she went back to the ambulance to give what she believed would be a second dose of ketamine to give Foster. LaMere, Hensley states, “did not take the appropriate actions” at that time, and “did not take the appropriate steps to notify anyone or treat the patient any different. It wasn’t until they got to the emergency room at Mercy One Medical Center that the defendant told the ER physician about the medication error.”
A pretrial conference in the case is scheduled for July 18, 2025.
State records indicate LaMere’s paramedic license with the Iowa Bureau of Emergency Medical and Trauma Services is in good standing, with no history of public disciplinary action, and that it expires in March 2027.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)After outcry from several corners of the legal community, Louisiana lawmakers scuttled a controversial proposal backed by Attorney General Liz Murrill that could have moved thousands of criminal cases involving children and teenagers from juvenile to adult courts every year. 
The Louisiana Senate Finance Committee voted 6-5 Monday to reject Senate Bill 74 by Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport. The committee’s decision came a few weeks after state voters overwhelmingly rejected a similar constitutional amendment. 
The legislation would have mostly affected Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge and Caddo parishes, where juvenile courts operate separately from district courts. 
Larry Frieman, chief deputy attorney general, told senators the bill was crafted specifically to address New Orleans juvenile court judges who are too lenient on the teens and children who come before them. 

“They are one of the ones that have created this problem that we are trying to fix,” Frieman said. 
Pushback for the bill came from a wide swath of people involved in the criminal justice system who often aren’t aligned with each other. District attorneys, public defenders, judges and anti-incarceration groups all spoke out against the proposal. 
“The logistics of it are not as simple as everyone seems to think,” said Kyla Romanach, chief public defender for East Baton Rouge Parish, who opposed the legislation. 
Had it been approved, the bill would have allowed district attorneys and the attorney general to transfer 15- and 16-year-olds accused of felony crimes from juvenile courts to state district courts that mostly handle adult cases. 
District attorneys and the attorney general also would have gained the ability to move cases involving children under 15 accused of any crime, misdemeanor or felony,  from juvenile courts to city and parish courts that focus on adult cases. 
District attorneys can already move 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds into the adult criminal justice system, but only when they are accused of the most serious crimes such as murder, manslaughter and rape.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The Louisiana Legislature also passed a statute last year that reclassifies all 17-year-olds as adults in the eyes of the criminal justice system. They are automatically tried in adult court and face adult prison sentences.

The attorney general’s failed legislation would have further blurred the lines between punishments for adults and minors in Louisiana, though the additional children and teenagers transferred from juvenile to adult courts under the bill would have been subjected to juvenile law standards, Frieman said. 

Judges, prosecutors and public defenders from the four parishes with juvenile courts indicated the attorney general’s proposal would cost their courthouses and offices hundreds of thousands of dollars each. 

District attorneys and public defenders from East Baton Rouge, Jefferson and Caddo all said they would have to hire more staff to track cases in juvenile and district court if the legislation had been approved. 
Federal and state law also require minors to be separated from adult detainees. District courthouses in the four affected parishes don’t have the appropriate accommodations for minors and would have had to retrofit their buildings. 

East Baton Rouge judges said the changes they would have to undertake at their courthouse would have cost between $3 million and $10 million, according to a legislative financial analysis.

Legislators initially delayed a vote on the bill last week over questions about the accuracy of the financial analysis attached to it. An earlier version didn’t have as many of the potential costs included, in part, because State Public Defender Rémy Starns told the legislative staff to disregard information about potential expenses. 
Daniel Druilhet, a member of the Legislative Fiscal Office staff,  said Starns asked him to ignore any costs public defenders had initially said would be associated with the attorney general’s proposal. 
“[W]hile I did receive an initial response from the Office of the State Public Defender, including information from those four jurisdictions related to potential costs, I was contacted by Mr. Starns on May 2, 2025, instructing me not to include that cost in the fiscal note,” Druilhet told senators at a public hearing last week. 
In response to Druilhet’s comments, the senators put off a vote on the matter for a week so a new financial write-up could be put together. 

Sen. Katrina Jackson-Andrews, D-Monroe, chastised Starns for intervening in the legislative process. 

“I want our state employees to understand there’s not a time when they can tell our fiscal office  not to consider costs that have been submitted,” she said after Druilhet’s testimony. 
Starns told Jackson he had decided, after an amendment was added to the legislation, that the expenses his office had turned over to the fiscal office were no longer relevant. 
Starns has been working closely with the attorney general on other criminal justice bills filed this session that would give Starns more authority over local public defender office budgets and personnel.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_5974-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, alleges that House Bill 25-1312 violates the First and 14th Amendments .
“The purpose of H.B. 25-1312 is clear. The law punishes those who refuse to speak using chosen names and pronouns, and it does so in order to suppress traditional beliefs about sex and gender. In other words, the law openly discriminates based on viewpoint,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote.

The lawsuit was brought by the Virginia-based conservative group Defending Education, the Colorado Parent Advocacy Network, Protect Kids Colorado, a health group called Do No Harm, and Grand Junction dermatologist Dr. Travis Morrell. CPAN and PKC are both parental-rights groups that advocate against “gender ideology” topics in schools, often from a far-right perspective.
It names Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, a Democrat, and the members of Colorado’s Civil Rights Division as defendants.
HB-1312, also known as the Kelly Loving Act after a transgender woman who died in the 2022 Club Q shooting, expands Colorado’s anti-discrimination laws to include a person’s chosen name and pronouns. Those laws apply to workplaces, schools and other places of public accommodation.
The law also includes provisions to make it easier for transgender people to change their name and gender markers on birth certificates, drivers licenses and marriage documents.
It was sponsored by Rep. Lorena Garcia of Adams County, Rep. Rebekah Stewart of Lakewood, Sen. Faith Winter of Broomfield and Sen. Chris Kolker of Centennial. It passed with entirely Democratic support, and Gov. Jared Polis signed it on May 16.
The bill was amended to remove several controversial provisions during the legislative process and faced stiff opposition from Republicans and conservative groups, including the parties in the new lawsuit.
They allege in the filing that the law could impact their ability to hold public advocacy events, publish materials and do other work. CPAN and PKC use “biologically accurate pronouns and birth names” for transgender people, a practice also known as misgendering and deadnaming. The groups worry that continuing to use those names and pronouns will result in an investigation from the state’s civil rights commission and individual lawsuits.
They argue that recent legal decisions — including 303 Creative v. Elenis, where a Colorado website designer did not want to create a hypothetical website for a gay couple — support the claim that HB-1312 unconstitutionally compels speech, in this case forcing them to refer to a transgender person by their name.
The lawsuit repeatedly misgenders and deadnames state Rep. Brianna Titone, former state legislative candidate Vivian Smotherman and transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney.
“When CPAN and (Executive Director) Ms. Gimelshteyn use birth names and biologically accurate pronouns, they are not doing so to be malicious or hurtful. They do so because this expression reflects their deeply held beliefs that sex is fixed in each person from the moment of conception and cannot be changed,” the lawsuit says. If they cannot use that language, their impact will be “greatly diminished.”
Morrell, the dermatologist, contended in the lawsuit that using someone’s “biological pronouns” is necessary for clear communication, as a person’s sex assigned at birth could be important when determining proper treatment.
Representatives from the Colorado Civil Rights Division and the attorney general’s office were unable to comment on the litigation.

,DC,2025-05-20 19:41:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,IRS nominee Billy Long probed by Democrats over non-existent tribal tax credits,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/irs-nominee-billy-long-probed-democrats-over-non-existent-tribal-tax-credits,,"WASHINGTON — Senators tasked with tax writing split along party lines Tuesday praising and grilling former Republican U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Internal Revenue Service, the agency tasked with enforcing the largest source of U.S. revenue as the country faces record debt and interest costs.Long, who served in Congress from 2011 to 2023 and previously spent multiple years as a talk radio host, testified to the Senate Finance Committee that he plans to get rid of “stinking thinking” at the IRS and implement a “comprehensive plan” to modernize the agency and “invest in retaining skilled members of the team.”“This does not mean a bloated agency, but an efficient one where employees have the tools they need to succeed,” Long said.The agency has lost more than 11,000 employees, or 11% of its workforce, either through deferred resignations or mass firing of probationary workers since Trump began his second term, according to a May 2 report from the agency’s inspector general. Trump said in December he intended to nominate Long for the IRS post.‘Top-down culture change’Committee Chair Mike Crapo of Idaho opened the confirmation hearing expressing his confidence in Long, saying he will direct a “sea change” at the agency that will benefit taxpayers.“President Trump called Congressman Long the ‘consummate people person.’ Congressman Long is very clear that he will make himself available to all IRS employees, no matter their seniority. Moreover, he wants to implement a top-down culture change at the agency,” Crapo said.The confirmation hearing comes as lawmakers struggle to agree on a budget reconciliation package, which will extend and expand Trump’s 2017 tax law and in turn widen IRS responsibilities.Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said he trusted Long’s work ethic and told him, “We're going to do a tax bill here in the next couple of months. To be able to get that done, as we did it in 2017, there'll be a lot of work the IRS has to do to be able to put guidance documents out, to be able to get clear instructions of what that means.”Non-existent tribal tax creditsDemocrats approached the hearing with skepticism.The nearly two-hour back-and-forth with Long followed recent revelations that he accepted donations to his defunct Senate campaign shortly after Trump nominated him as the IRS commissioner. Democratic senators on the panel have also called for an investigation into Long’s work with a company that peddled non-existent tribal tax credits.“Bottom line, the American people have the right to know whether the future IRS commissioner is a crook,” said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the panel’s top Democrat.Long denies any wrongdoing.Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Nevada Democrat, pressed Long about $65,000 he allegedly received for his involvement promoting the fake tax credits for the companies Capital Edge Strategies and White River.“Knowing that (the credits) are illegal, the IRS has said they're illegal, how do you stand here before this committee and tell the chairman just a few minutes ago that you have no conflict of interest?” Cortez Masto asked.Long replied that he’s in compliance with the Office of Government Ethics regarding his nomination and that he “did not have any perception whatsoever that these (credits) did not exist.”Other Democrats on the panel questioned Long on Trump’s recent statements that he would pull Harvard University’s tax-exempt status over its refusal to comply with demands from the administration.Wyden characterized Long as a “MAGA devotee” and said that Trump wants to use the IRS “as a cudgel to beat his adversaries into submission.”14-page letterSen. Elizabeth Warren, who sent Long a 14-page letter questioning his past, repeatedly asked Long about a statute prohibiting the president from ordering tax audits on specific people or businesses.“Is it illegal for the President to instruct the IRS to remove nonprofit status from taxpayers?” Warren asked several times.“I’m not going to have the answer that you need, I apologize,” Long said.Senate Republicans on the panel questioned Long on how he can improve customer service for taxpayers — despite the party successfully fighting in 2023 to cut new IRS funding under President Joe Biden in 2022.Sen. Todd Young of Indiana said the agency is “behind the curve” on technology and that its customer service issues are “out of hand.”“If confirmed, will you commit to developing a comprehensive IRS modernization plan that prioritizes customer service, identifies critical technology infrastructure needs and ensures greater transparency and audit practices? Yes or no?” Young asked.“Yes,” Long replied.“Excellent,” Young said.",,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

Ron DeSantis speaking at the Vault in Tampa on May 20, 2025 (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)When Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended two Democratic state attorneys in recent years, he contended that both deserved to be removed because they were ignoring the law and not following their duties. But when asked on Tuesday in Tampa why he now supports his hand-picked attorney general saying that he wouldn’t defend the state law banning individuals 21 and under from purchasing a long gun, the governor called it a “different situation.”
DeSantis told a Phoenix reporter at a news conference in Tampa Tuesday morning that he stands behind Attorney General James Uthmeier’s decision to not fight the law if the case is accepted by the U.S. Supreme Court.
“You have an obligation to support and defend the Constitution,” he said. “And there are times when you have to make judgments about that. Now, those state attorneys were basically saying that they didn’t want to enforce statutes that the Legislature had done. They made their arguments as to why, but ultimately, I didn’t find those arguments to be persuasive.”
Uthmeier stated in March that if the National Rifle Association decided to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit denying their claim that Florida’s 2018 law barring individuals under the age of 21 from buying a long gun is unconstitutional, his office would not defend the law in front of the nine justices in Washington D.C.  That possibility now exists after the NRA announced on Friday that they would appeal the 11th Circuit’s ruling to the highest court in the land (the Supreme Court has not said if it will hear the case).
Uthmeier has not said anything publicly about the NRA lawsuit since the gun rights organization filed the appeal on Friday
DeSantis said Tuesday that he personally has always believed the law to be unconstitutional. That measure was passed just weeks after the mass shooting at Parkland on Feb. 14, 2018, that claimed the lives of 17 people. The governor said that “it was an emotional time” in describing why the GOP-controlled Legislature passed the law, which received bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Rick Scott. But he maintains that Uthmeier’s stance to not fight for the law in the U.S. Supreme Court is a “good faith position” because he doesn’t believe it’s consistent with the state Constitution.
“So that’s different than just saying that laws that have been passed you don’t like,” he added. “You can say that they’re unconstitutional, but that’s gotta be credible. It is credible. There’s a lot of people who have contested the constitutionality of suspending entirely someone’s right under an enumerated provision of the Constitution. I mean, I’m not just saying, ‘I have a right to this.’ There’s an enumerated provision. You’ve got people that are 18 years old that will be sent halfway around the world to carry a rifle in the Marine Corps. Then they finish that and they’re 20 and they can’t buy a rifle to go hunt? I think that’s a big problem.”
While the 11th Circuit has denied the NRA’s case, other federal courts have split on the issue of whether adults under 21 enjoy Second Amendment rights. The 3rd, 5th and 8th circuits have ruled that they do, while the 10th and 11th circuits have upheld laws banning firearm purchases by adults under 21.
When DeSantis suspended Hillsborough County State Attorney Andrew Warren in August 2022, he said “State attorneys have a duty to prosecute crimes as defined in Florida law, not to pick and choose which laws to enforce based on his personal agenda.”
The Phoenix reached out to Andrew Warren for a response.

“It’s clearly hypocritical,” he said in an email. “Asking him to explain himself is a complete waste of breath; they all lie with impunity.”
Warren was unsuccessful in his court battle to win his seat back, and ended up losing to Republican Suzy Lopez, the woman DeSantis appointed to replace him, last fall. The other state attorney the governor suspended, Orange/Osceola County State Attorney Monique Worrell did win her seat back last fall, defeating candidate Andrew Bain, whom the governor appointed to replace Worrell in 2023.
DeSantis has said that he also backs Uthmeier’s decision not to obey a federal court order requiring law enforcement agencies in Florida to halt immigration arrests under a new state law. That federal judge has said that Uthmeier needs to show cause why he should not be held in contempt or sanctioned for violating her order and will hold a hearing on the matter next week.
The Florida House of Representatives in March repealed the ban by supporting a measure that would lower the age for individuals in Florida to purchase shotguns and rifles from 21 to 18. It was the third year in a row they have done so, but none of those proposals ever reached DeSantis’ desk because the Florida Senate chose not to follow suit.
A gun safety advocate blasted the decision by DeSantis and Uthmeier to not stand up for the law banning individuals under 21 from being able to purchase a long gun.
“Florida’s law was passed in the wake of the devastating Parkland mass shooting, and it’s beyond doubt constitutional. (U.S.) Attorney General Pam Bondi and her successors defended this lifesaving law against the NRA’s attacks for years as Florida’s attorney general, and ultimately the 11th Circuit upheld it by a vote of 8 to 4, in a decision joined by both Republican and Democratic appointees,” said Janet Carter, managing director of Second Amendment litigation at Everytown Law. “It is absurd for Florida’s governor and new attorney general to try and claim otherwise, especially when research shows prohibiting 18-20 year-olds from purchasing firearms is a commonsense tool for preventing gun violence.”

Raylee's Law would prevent parents from removing their child from school to homeschool them if a teacher has reported them for abuse. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals says convictions must stand against three adults who are in prison for their roles in the death of 8-year-old Raylee Browning.
The high-profile case has spurred attempted legislative changes — a bill known as “Raylee’s Law” — by a Democratic lawmaker who says the state’s limited homeschool regulations create a loophole to shield child abuse and neglect. Raylee was being homeschooled. 
The girl was underweight when she died in 2018 from sepsis because of a severe bacterial pneumonia infection. Raylee’s father, Marty Browning Jr., his wife and another adult ignored her deteriorating condition, a judge said, and court records said the adults failed to provide medicine or water. They were found guilty of neglect and sentenced to prison for 3 to 15 years. 
Marty Browning, his wife Julie Browning and Sherie Titchenell each appealed their convictions for a list of reasons that included a denial to a speedy trial and improperly admitting certain evidence. 
In three separate opinions issued Monday, the state Supreme Court denied their appeals, upholding the adults’ 2022 convictions in Fayette County Circuit Court.
Browning had been removed her from public school after her teachers reported suspected child abuse to Child Protective Services. According to testimony during the adults’ trial, CPS didn’t respond to the referral. 
The legislation, sponsored for multiple years by Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, seeks to pause a parent’s request to homeschool if there’s a pending child abuse investigation against the parent.
A bill including Raylee’s Law passed the House of Delegates this year, but wasn’t taken up by the Senate.

Taylor, who was elected to the Court of Appeals in 2023, will run against conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley in a race that will decide if liberals expand their majority on the Court. 
The two previous state Supreme Court elections, which consolidated the current 4-3 liberal majority, broke national spending records for judicial races. While the stakes won’t be as high in next year’s race, Bradley has been a prominent supporter of conservative causes since she was appointed to the Court by Gov. Scott Walker in 2015. 
Bradley sided with President Donald Trump in his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has been a vocal member of the right-wing Federalist Society. 
The election takes place just seven months before the midterm elections when statewide offices including governor and attorney general, as well as control of the Legislature, will be up for grabs — giving the state a view of the voting public’s mood before November. 
Taylor previously worked as Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin’s public policy director and served in the Assembly from 2013 until she was appointed to the Dane County Circuit Court in 2020. 
“As an attorney, public servant, and now as a judge, I’ve always been committed to making sure everyone is able to access our justice system,” Taylor said in a statement. “The law is a powerful tool for protecting Wisconsinites, holding people accountable, and making our state stronger.” 
“Justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court must be fair, independent, and impartial,” Taylor said. “Justice Rebecca Bradley has proven that she’s more interested in pushing her own right-wing political agenda than protecting Wisconsinites’ rights and freedoms. Extremism and partisanship have no place on our state’s highest court. Everyone who comes before the court deserves to be heard, respected, and treated equally – that’s exactly what I’ll do as a Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice.”
While Taylor has been elected to office six times, she has only faced a Republican opponent once. She ran unopposed for her Madison-area Assembly seat in 2012, 2014 and 2018. When she had an opponent in 2016, she won with 83% of the vote. She also ran unopposed for re-election to the Dane County Court in 2021 and for her seat on the District IV Court of Appeals in 2023. 
In a statement, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chair Brian Schimming noted that she’s never had to win the votes of people outside of heavily Democratic Dane County.
“Chris Taylor’s extreme partisan record has never been on full display outside of Dane County,” Schimming said. “After ‘liberal express lane’ elections in Dane County and an appointment from Tony Evers, Radical Democrat Chris Taylor will now have to answer for her extremely partisan record in the Legislature and on the bench.”

Faced with a $507 million deficit, North Carolina’s State Health Plan will require a combination of strategies to address the fiscal cliff and ensure the long-term care of the plan’s nearly 750,000 teachers and state employees.
On Tuesday, the State Health Plan’s Board of Trustees gave its initial approval to a series of actions that would reorient the plan, incentivizing members to use “bundled” participating providers or facilities.
  Treasurer Brad Briner and State Health Plan trustees discuss benefit changes to help stabilize the system. (Screengrab from May 20, 2025 meeting)
State employees and teachers would also be asked to do their part by paying higher health insurance premiums starting in 2026.
“We began this conversation in January around premium increases for the first time in eight years, a tack that nobody wanted to take,” said state Treasurer Brad Briner. “But buried in the materials here, you’ll see that what was going to be a $20 (monthly) premium increase at the lowest tier. It’s now a $5 premium increase at the lowest tier.”
Briner said significant time has been spent trying to insulate North Carolina’s lowest compensated employees from increases as much as possible, while determining the highest and best use of the dollars that are available. Out-of-pocket maximums would not change substantially, he pledged.
The State Health Plan is also taking steps towards eliminating all prior authorizations for independent primary care, another incentive for plan participants.
Thomas Friedman, executive administrator of the State Health Plan, said state employees who are members of the plan can expect several changes in the months ahead. For starters, the names of the most common plans will change.
  Source: State Health Plan presentation
The 70/30 plan will become the “Standard PPO plan” with annual deductibles rising from $1,500 to $3,000 for individuals, and families seeing their deductibles rise from $4,500 to $9,000. The average monthly premium would jump from $25 per month to $40 per month and could be adjusted higher based on the employee’s salary.
The 80/20 plan will be known as the “Plus PPO Plan” with annual deductibles rising from $1,250 to $1,500 for individuals, and from $3,250 for families under the current plan rising to $4,500. Those on the 80/20 plan would see their premiums jump from an average of $50 per month to $100. Higher income earners could see a monthly premium of $130.
While the numbers may not be popular with state workers or teachers, trustee Dr. Brad Miller noted that on the private insurance market, individuals are paying an average premium of $119 a month, with families paying a premium of $532.

What members pay for prescription drugs would also rise next year and in some cases substantially. Specialty medications (Tier 5) would increase from $350 under the current 70/30 plan to $600 under the new Standard plan.
Friedman noted that manufacturer coupons exist for many high-end, specialty drugs, allowing patients to pay little or nothing at all.
“Why not have the manufacturers pay more if they’re willing to do it?” Friedman offered.
Coverage of the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs remains “under development,” but nutrition and weight loss coaching would be available to everyone.
Moving forward, the State Health Plan is working to make it attractive to members – both financially and in terms of access – to engage with preferred providers.
Tuesday’s meeting of the Board of Trustees came as members of the state House advanced their own budget blueprint.
Friedman said that both the House and Senate budget proposals have fully funded the requests of the State Health Plan at a 5% premium increase per year.
“Given everything going on in the state and how little the budget increased, we are a substantial portion of that, and we are very grateful that they listened.”
Treasurer Briner also offered praise for the budget proposal emerging from the House.
“The House proposal fully funds the pension plan and increases funding to the State Health Plan to help in our effort to provide affordable, high-quality health care for state workers. Investments made in salary increases and cost-of-living bonuses will help ensure that the state can retain top talent.”

But Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the North Carolina Association of Educators, said that the legislature should step up its funding, rather than ask school employees and state workers to shoulder higher health care costs.
“It’s not only unfair, but it is unsustainable,” Walker-Kelly told the trustees.
“We are already facing a critical staffing shortage, more than 8,000 school positions were vacant at the start of this year and one-in-five teachers left the classroom over the past two years. If we increase the cost for those who stay, how will we fill the gaps and who will be there for our students?”
Walker-Kelly said the decision is not simply about numbers on a spreadsheet; it is about the people who keep our schools and state services running.
A vote by the board to set the premiums for 2026 is set for Mid-August. Open enrollment with the new 2026 rates will be October 13-31.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic will know by Friday whether it will have to delay plans to begin holding Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees in June at its Leavenworth facility.
The city of Leavenworth in March filed suit in U.S. District Court asking for an injunction barring CoreCivic from moving forward on a contract with ICE to turn its closed Leavenworth prison into an immigrant detention facility.
The city also asked the court to determine whether CoreCivic must obtain a special use permit before reopening the prison, as the two parties disagree about whether CoreCivic falls under the city’s development regulations.
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse heard more than two hours of arguments Tuesday and questioned attorneys about why the injunction should be put in place. He promised a quick decision so the city would have time to appeal, if necessary, before CoreCivic follows through on its stated intent of reopening the facility June 1 as the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“The complaint talks a lot about the scene on the ground,” Crouse said. “I’m not focused on whether this is a good idea or a bad idea.”
Crouse referred to the city’s initial filing that, in part, highlighted what it called the “unquantifiable harm caused by CoreCivic’s mismanagement.” 
The city’s filing alleged difficulties CoreCivic caused in Leavenworth in the past, including failing to cooperate with city police, failing to report the death of an inmate for six days and “routinely refusing to turn over evidence.” 
Instead, Crouse spent his time questioning whether the city and its attorney, Joseph Hatley, had included a good cause of action in its filings. A cause of action, according to Cornell Law School, is “a set of predefined factual elements that allow for a legal remedy.”
“What basis do I have to act?” Crouse asked Hatley.
Hatley told the judge and asserted in an interview after the hearing that a solid cause of action was CoreCivic officials declining to apply for a special use permit as required by Leavenworth development regulations.
The city of Leavenworth put development regulations in place in 2012, during the time when CoreCivic ran the prison as the Leavenworth Detention Center. At that point, it was grandfathered in because it was already operating, Hatley said.
However, the facility closed in 2021 and has not operated as a detention center since, Hatley said. That means CoreCivic must get a special use permit to reopen, a statement CoreCivic attorney Taylor Hausmann said was inaccurate.
She told Crouse that because CoreCivic has not changed the business it operates at the facility, which was open from 1992 to 2021 as a detention facility, and because they did not abandon the facility, they should not need to get a new special use permit.
Hausmann also said she believes the actions the city is taking are politically motivated. 
“We think it is telling that the decision to attempt to revoke the special use did not come until after CoreCivic entered into a contract with ICE,” she said. “That’s really what this is about, to leverage greater control over CoreCivic’s operations at the MRRC. We don’t think that’s appropriate.”
Hatley said the city had not filed in court previously because CoreCivic initially agreed with the city and in February applied for a special use permit. Then the company withdrew that application in February and said it did not think one was needed.

Hatley said an injunction stopping CoreCivic from housing ICE detainees at the facility would be a temporary measure while CoreCivic walked through the process of getting a special use permit.
“We’re not talking about lengthy delay, 2 to 3 months,” he said.
Leavenworth Mayor Holly Pittman, who attended the hearing along with several other city officials, said after the hearing that the city would be amenable to working with CoreCivic.
“I think we’d entertain any business, but they need to do it the right way,” she said.
City manager Scott Peterson, also at the hearing, denied that Leavenworth’s actions are politically motivated.
More than 20 people gathered outside the Frank Carlson Federal Building in Topeka where the court hearing was held to protest CoreCivic and the for-profit detention of immigrants. Many were part of the Kansas Interfaith Action advocacy group, said Rabbi Moti Rieber, who spoke passionately about why he objected to reopening the Leavenworth prison as an ICE facility.
He called CoreCivic a “bad corporate actor.”
“It’s the confluence of a lot of dysfunction,” Rieber said. “The private prison industry and Trump’s racist immigration policies are all coming together. At the current time, we’re seeing Trump’s ICE gestapo taking people off the streets, putting them in prison without due process. CoreCivic wants to take advantage of that.”
Others, like Pastor Jordan Stone from Atonement Lutheran Church in Overland Park, said this went against her faith.
“I think caring for our neighbors, caring for the least of these is important,” she said. “Standing up as a person of faith and saying this is not okay is important.” 
Stone said others may have different viewpoints about that, but she believes it comes from a place of fear.
“I think it doesn’t come from a place of caring,” she said.
Pastor Joanna Harader, of Bethel College Mennonite Church in Newton, spoke against private prisons and CoreCivic’s track record. She also was concerned about the current administration’s treatment of immigrants. 
“I’m disturbed by the lack of due process being given to immigrants,” Harader said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200575-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

Long, who worked as an auctioneer before serving six terms representing a Southwest Missouri congressional district, also denied seeking donations from anyone associated with those companies that he used to pay off a personal loan he gave to his unsuccessful 2022 campaign for U.S. Senate. 
“You know as well as I do that anytime you’re dealing with the (Federal Elections Commission), you have to follow FEC guidelines,” Long told members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. “And that’s exactly what I did all the way through.”
Democrats on the committee were not convinced that Long didn’t ask for the money.
“You expect us to believe that the money just fell out of the sky and it showed up in your campaign treasury?” said U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. 
In December, Trump nominated Long to lead the IRS. At the time, Long’s campaign committee had $130,000 in debt — money that Long had loaned the campaign himself.
By early January, his Senate campaign committee raised $137,000, with much of the money coming from executives at companies that have been accused of selling fraudulent tax credits.
Billy Long’s bid to lead IRS under scrutiny over donations that paid off personal debt

In addition to the campaign donations, Wyden hammered Long for allegedly raking in “referral fees, steering clients to firms that sold fake tax shelters and pushing small businesses to unknowingly commit tax fraud.”
A financial disclosure Long submitted as part of his confirmation process shows him receiving at least $5,000 in compensation from White River, an Arkansas-based oil and gas company that sold a tax credit that the IRS says doesn’t actually exist. 
White River said in a statement that Long made an “insignificant amount of referrals of these credits to third parties” for the company, and that no federal agency has ever told it the credits are invalid. 
Long on Tuesday denied he’d ever met or interacted with anyone at White River and claimed he had only referred the credits to a few friends.
The Missouri Republican also faced tough questions from U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, over whether President Donald Trump is allowed to use the IRS to strip organizations of their nonprofit status.
Warren pointed to a portion of federal law that prohibits any member of the executive branch to request the IRS to conduct or terminate an audit on a taxpayer. 
“In the first place, he wouldn’t do that,” Long said.
“That’s not my question, Mr. Long,” Warren responded. 
A few seconds of back and forth later, Long said he was “going to follow the law,” but that “I’d have to go to the lawyers at the IRS to tell me.” 
Warren wasn’t impressed. 
“If you think follow the law is you get to make it up on the spot,” she said, “then you don’t get to be the IRS commissioner.” 
U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat, continued the line of questioning later, pressing Long over whether he had previously said he would ignore an order from Trump to audit a taxpayer. 
“I think I told you that he wouldn’t do that in the first place,” Long responded, “but if he did, I’d do exactly what you said. So, yes.”
In his opening statement, Long vowed to make long-needed changes at the agency if confirmed to be the next IRS commissioner. And if he isn’t ultimately confirmed, he’ll gladly head back to Missouri.  
“I have the opportunity to make real transformational change to an agency that needs it more than any other federal agency,” he said. “Or I can go back home to southwest Missouri where the fish are biting and as they say, they ain’t going to catch themselves.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/candidatefilingday02222022000027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471

HIV is the virus that, without treatment, can cause someone to have acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.

“We are especially alarmed by the termination of $42 million in grants for HIV research. Florida has the third-highest rate of new HIV diagnoses in the country, and our communities rely on these programs to test, treat and prevent the spread of HIV.

U.S. Reps. Lois Frankel, Debbie Wasserman-Schultz , Kathy Castor, Frederica Wilson, Darren Soto, Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, Maxwell Frost and Jared Moskowitz signed onto the letter.

“The minor events of history are valuable, though not always showy or picturesque.” — Mark Twain, 1891
“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary.” — Donald Trump, 2025
If I could slow time down just a kiss it would all come back, clear as that wink of a moon over freshly planted rows of cotton on Trout Valley Farm. Seems like only yesterday I was living out my calling, farming with my family in Tallahatchie County. The year before we had picked our best crop on record, and 2018 promised healthier markets for the fiber. Heading into spring I couldn’t wait to prep fields for planting. 
As farmers we are fundamentally hopeful people. The mere act of putting a seed into the earth and hanging the well-being of an entire family on it is itself an act of radical hope. As I once heard my father say, “Every year I take all I have and all I hope to ever have and plow it into the ground.”
And so, we entered the 2018 planting season with even more cotton acres than 2017. We didn’t know then there was doom on the horizon, though no one in our universe had ever heard of Wuhan, China.
And yet, China loomed large in our daily discussions about the future. A trade war simmered throughout the Spring. It was like the child’s game “King of the Hill: Tariff Edition.” The contestants: President Trump and General Secretary Xi JinPing. Every time cotton and grain markets went on a run, a presidential tweet or an announcement from Beijing would send commodities tumbling, as Sisyphus after a traipse up the mountain. 
By 2019 the markets were severely depressed for both. A tariff-induced depressed market, untimely drought, runaway production costs, and uncertainty due to the trade war forced us to close the doors on a 148-year-old, multi-generational, family-run farm. We became another victim of economic central planning and the hapless confluence of calamitous circumstances.

It caused my wife, our young daughter and me to upend our lives. The dream I worked for all my adult life and upon which my future depended, dead. At 40-years old, I had to recalibrate. My wife and I had to move from my community where we were both hopeful and active participants in its revitalization. 
In 2019, there was a 20% increase in farm bankruptcies across America. And this despite government largesse in the form of an inflation-inducing 28-billion-dollar bailout. While bankruptcies ran rampant, we don’t even know the total number of farmers who simply stopped, as we did, rented their land and moved away. In the final accounting, we’ll likely find that depopulation and dispossession of our rural and agricultural class is what led to America’s demise. 
While a farm is a dynamic and complex enterprise whereby any number and any combination of things can cause its failure, there is one thing that poses a greater immediate threat to any farm at any moment: Tariffs. 
Agrarian people have always known this. Our history is replete with political and sectional strife over the federal government’s use of tariffs and the redistributionism that comes with it. This history needs a little sunshine as agricultural people have always pulled the short straw with protectionist tariffs. 
The current iteration, as far as I can tell, is a negotiating tactic, yes. Revenue tariffs, it seems. But, President Trump has also been adamant that they are protectionist, intended to bring manufacturing jobs back, which, of course, is a laudable goal. It’s not clear that further impoverishing farm families, many of whom are already in financial straits, is the way to do it.
A recent Farm Journal poll showed that 54% of farmers don’t support tariffs as a negotiating strategy. The same poll found a bleak 92% of agriculture economists believe tariffs will hurt farmers in the long run. All the while the number of farmers has dwindled to a point where we are no longer a statistically significant parcel of the population.
Conflicts concerning tariffs along the urban/agricultural divide go back to the early years of the Republic. In 1816 Congress approved the first protective tariff, the Dallas Tariff at 20% to help pay off the debt from the War of 1812. They also wanted to level the playing field between English manufacturing and the nascent attempt at industrialism in the North. In 1824, the Sectional Tariff on imported goods went to 33% . In another four years the “Tariff of Abominations” placed a 38% tax on 92% of imported goods. Each of these found opposition across the South, as Southern farmers sold their crops and bought their goods on the international market. So, they had to pay more for goods and sell their crops for less, as we did in 2018.
South Carolina threatened secession. By 1832, South Carolina had the support of several states and declared these tariffs unconstitutional, thus unenforceable. President Andrew Jackson threatened the unthinkable: using the military to go to South Carolina and collect the duties at gun point. In 1833, President Jackson successfully urged Congress to pass the Force Act, to get the authority to do it. Henry Clay (architect of the American System agenda) and John C. Calhoun (Jackson’s vice president) avoided a disaster by reaching a compromise to incrementally reduce the tariffs, thereby stopping the Nullification Crisis from devolving into violence.
By 1842 Northern industrial interests were back at it with the Black Tariff. This put rates back around the levels of the “Tariff of Abominations.” The South howled claiming revolution was the only solution for this issue. James Polk won the next election and started reducing the tariff. The Walker Tariff of 1846 lowered the average rate to 25%. This stimulated trade and led to higher government revenues. While other major sectional differences persisted, on the tariff front, at least, the sections seemed satisfied.
In 1857, however, with a healthy tariff of around 15%, it began to fall apart. There was a financial panic that year caused by several converging events. However, a leading economist – Henry Carey, a Republican and avowed protectionist– laid the whole thing at the feet of the lower tariffs.
Due to Carey’s prominence, Rep. Justin Smith Morrill (R., Vermont), a founder of the Republican Party, recruited him to help develop a new tariff. For two years, prior to 1860, Congress debated the Morrill Tariff. It didn’t pass until after Abraham Lincoln’s election once states had started to secede. James Buchanan signed it into law on March 2, 1861, two days before Lincoln’s inauguration. 
As early as 1832, in the midst of the Nullification Crises, Lincoln said, “I am in favor of the internal improvement system and a high protective tariff,” before adding 28 years later in 1860, “My views have undergone no change… the tariff is to the government what a meal is to a family.” The Morrill tariff both informed and defined U.S. trade policy until the second incarnation of the income tax in 1913.
So, in terms of cultural differences in economic philosophy, what does this history verify except that farmers and stakeholders in an agricultural economy dependent on foreign trade have always vehemently advocated for free trade and against protectionist tariffs. And, that protectionist tariffs are a fundamental part of the Republican Party’s DNA. In fact, the Republican Party’s platform from 1860 featured the tariff as its 12th plank.
Mike Wagner, who owns Two Brooks Rice and farms grain in the Delta commiserated recently, “This tariff talk comes at the worst possible time for many of America’s farmers. There’s a perfect storm of conditions already [rising taxes, land/equipment/production costs] …China has not bought U.S. corn or soy since Jan. 16th.” After a pensive pause, he continued, “This happened most recently during the 45th presidency, and our export capacity never regained its footing…when agricultural markets are lost, the loss is permanent or gruelingly regained. A nation that can’t maintain the foundational part of its economy that farming is, and won’t support her growers, sacrifices her best defense.”
To better understand the impact of these particular tariffs, I spoke with Hank Reichle, president and CEO of Staplcotn, the oldest and largest cotton cooperative in the U.S. Echoing Mark Twain, he proffered, “By the way, history rhymes. Here we go again, like the Nullification Crisis, where agrarian South Carolina was concerned with tariffs restricting commerce, this time states concerned with the same are actually taking the President to court over the tariffs. 
“Compared to President Trump’s first term, this trade war is a little different because it doesn’t involve only China. Tariffs are only good for farmers if they create a competitive marketing advantage.” Reiterating the danger to farmers, he explained, “Tariffs slow the global economic growth that fuels consumption and so decreases demand for commodities.”
But, Reichle doesn’t only predict despair and doom. Due to the reciprocal nature of the context President Trump created, we could see commodity markets rise as new markets open to U.S. farmers. According to Reichle, “…there are several countries that buy a significant amount of cotton on the export market who could easily increase purchases from the U.S. while decreasing them from the likes of Brazil and Australia…”
Tenuous as it is, I worry for all my friends still farming and welcome this bit of hope. This is a year wherein the lives of many farmers and their families’ futures hang in the balance. If we get to harvest without a solution, it will not bode well for any of us. For without farmers prayerfully, hopefully and profitably “plowing all they have into the ground” every year, American society and its position in the world will crumble. 
Our greatest hope now is that our representatives in Washington remember their constituents and make deals (and tax cuts) that are in our best interest. Quickly.
Or, as Wagner put it, “Farming has always been a full contact sport…We need leadership. Not leadershit.”

Kennedy Jr. testified before Congress on Tuesday that a major report due out later this week from his agency will not disparage farmers or a commonly used pesticide.Kennedy, who has long been critical of certain aspects of modern agriculture and processed food, at a U.S. Senate hearing urged lawmakers to read the widely anticipated “Make America Healthy Again” report once it's published Thursday, but didn’t go into details about any possible recommendations.“Everybody will see the report,” Kennedy said. “And there's nobody that has a greater commitment to the American farmer than we do. The MAHA movement collapses if we can't partner with the American farmer in producing a safe, robust and abundant food supply.”His comments followed stern questioning from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who said she had read news reports from ""reliable sources” that the MAHA Commission’s initial assessment “may unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools that roughly 2% of our population relies on to help feed the remaining 98%.”“If Americans lose confidence in the safety and integrity of our food supply due to the unfounded claims that mislead consumers, public health will be at risk,” Hyde-Smith said. “I've said this before, and it's worth saying again, countries have gone to war over many things — politics, religion, race, trade, natural resources, oil, pride, you name it — but threaten a nation's food supply and allow people to go hungry. Let's see what happens then.”Hyde-Smith, who was her home state’s commissioner of agriculture and commerce from 2012 to 2018, probed Kennedy about his past work in environmental law and whether he might be inserting “confirmation bias” into the forthcoming report.She asked Kennedy if he would try to change the current approval for glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, that she referred to as “one of the most thoroughly studied products of its kind.”“We're talking about more than 1,500 studies and 50-plus years of review by the EPA and other leading global health authorities that have affirmed its safety when used as directed,"" Hyde-Smith said. ""Have you been able to review thousands of studies and decades of scientific review in a matter of months?""Kennedy responded that her “information about the report is just simply wrong.”“The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,” Kennedy said.Hyde-Smith continued her questioning and told Kennedy that it would be “a shame if the MAHA commission issues reports suggesting, without substantial facts and evidence, that our government got things terribly wrong when it reviewed a number of crop protection tools and deemed them to be safe.”Home energy program in MaineSeveral other Republicans on the Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee raised concerns during the two-hour hearing about how Kennedy has run HHS since they confirmed him in February.Maine Sen. Susan Collins, chairwoman of the full Appropriations Committee, brought up the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which the Trump administration has called on Congress to eliminate.“The LIHEAP program, which we've talked about, is absolutely vital for thousands of older Mainers and low-income families,” Collins said. “It helps them avoid the constant worry of having to choose between keeping warm, buying essential foods and medications and other basic necessities.”Kennedy sought to distance himself from the president’s budget request, saying that he understands “the critical, historical importance of this program.”“President (Donald) Trump's rationale and (the Office of Management and Budget’s) rationale is that President Trump's energy policies are going to lower the cost of energy … so that everybody will get lower cost heating oil,” Kennedy said.NIH indirect costsSubcommittee Chairwoman Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., brought up several issues with Kennedy, including efforts to change how much the National Institutes of Health provides to medical schools and research universities for Facilities and Administrative fees, often called indirect costs.NIH sought to set that amount at 15% across the board for any institution that receives a research grant from the agency, a significantly lower amount than many of the organizations had negotiated over the years, bringing about strong objections from institutions of higher education.That NIH policy has not taken effect as several lawsuits work their way through the federal court system.Kennedy indicated NIH has figured out a way to help medical schools and research universities pay for items like gloves, test tubes and mass spectrometers, particularly at state schools.“In the public universities, we are very much aware that those universities are using the money well, that it is absolutely necessary for them. And we're looking at a series of different ways that we can fund those costs through them,” Kennedy said. “But not through the independent, indirect cost structure, which loses all control, which deprives us of all control of how that money is spent.”Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, a Republican, brought up the measles outbreak and pressed Kennedy on whether HHS needed additional resources to help his home state and others get the virus under control.Kennedy testified the “best way to prevent the spread of measles is through vaccination” and that HHS has been urging “people to get their MMR vaccines.”South Dakota grant on mine safetySouth Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds called on Kennedy to continue fixing issues created earlier this year when HHS fired people working on mine safety issues at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.“My office has learned that staff at NIOSH's Spokane mining research division have been laid off. This office focuses on the unique challenges of Western mining operations that are often more geologically complex and exposed to harsher conditions,” Rounds said. “This division provides critical technical support for institutions like the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, which recently received a $1.25 million grant to improve underground mining safety. However, the grant has now been canceled due to loss of oversight from the Spokane office.""This is not just a missed opportunity, it undermines our ability to meet national security goals tied to mineral independence and supply chain resilience.""Kennedy testified that he’s been able to bring back 238 workers at the agency and said he would work with Rounds to address ongoing issues.Pledge to fund Head Start, but no dollar amountAlabama Sen. Katie Britt, a Republican, asked Kennedy about news reports earlier this year that HHS would ask Congress to zero out funding for Head Start, one of numerous programs left out of the administration’s skinny budget request. Head Start provides early learning, health, family and development programs for free for children from low-income families.Kennedy testified that eliminating Head Start would likely not be in the full budget request, which is set to be released later this year, though the White House budget office has not said when. He said it would ask Congress to fully fund the program, but didn’t share a dollar amount.“There's 800,000 of the poorest kids in this country who are served by this program. It not only teaches the kids preschool skills — reading, writing and arithmetic — before they get to prepare them for school. But it also teaches the parents and teaches them how to be good parents.”Kennedy said there are challenges faced by the Head Start program that he hopes to change during the next four years, including the quality of the food.“The food they're serving at Head Start is terrible. You need to change that,” Kennedy said. “We're poisoning the poorest kids from their youngest years, and we're going to change that.”",,,,2025-05-20 16:07:55.502471
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 19:08:02+00:00,CT Mirror,‘Just cause’ eviction reform dies in CT legislature — again,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/20/ct-just-cause-evictions-bill/,"Although lawmakers said many of their colleagues privately supported the idea, not enough of them were willing to vote in favor of the bill.","Proposed reform to state eviction laws — which would have required landlords to provide a reason for evicting someone, a concept known as “just cause” — will not move forward this year, proponents said Tuesday.
As the legislature’s 2025 session approaches its final weeks, Housing Committee Co-Chair, Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said he doesn’t expect House Bill 6889 to come up for a vote in the House. The bill, which had broad support from Connecticut renters and housing advocates, passed the Housing Committee in March.
Although lawmakers who endorsed eviction reform said many of their colleagues privately supported it, not enough of them were willing to go public with that support by voting in favor of the bill.
“I don’t think there is any path forward at this point,” Felipe said Tuesday morning. “I believe we have the votes. I don’t believe those votes are all willing to be public at this point.”
Last year, Felipe faced problems in the House with a similar bill that would have reformed evictions in Connecticut. Although Senate leadership believed they had the votes, the House wasn’t able to secure enough support.
Felipe championed the just cause eviction bill again this session. The bill would have banned no-fault evictions, which typically occur at the end of a lease, in buildings with five or more units, after the tenant had been there for at least a year. Connecticut has similar protections in place for renters with disabilities and seniors.
Tenants say this type of eviction may be used in retaliation when renters complain about housing conditions or to evict every resident of a building or complex when new ownership purchases the property. 
Negotiations over the bill have been going back and forth for weeks. Members of the Democratic party were split, even in the committee process.
H.B. 6889 drew some of the most heated debate and the largest number of speakers of any bill the Housing Committee considered this session. 
Landlords opposed the bill, saying it would make it harder for them to evict problem tenants.
“There is no more cause for the ‘just cause’ bill today than there was when the legislature rejected it last year, because it does not protect Connecticut’s apartment communities and will not build one new apartment home to relieve the state’s housing shortage,” the Connecticut Apartment Association said in an April press release about the bill.
Ultimately, the bill faced a similar fate this year. 
Luke Melonakos-Harrison, vice president of the Connecticut Tenants Union, said Tuesday that the news of its demise was disheartening, particularly considering the hundreds of renters who testified and the broad support it drew from advocacy groups focused on housing, homelessness, health and labor unions.
“I don’t understand what these Democrats are so afraid of,”  Melonakos-Harrison said, adding that about a third of Connecticut residents are tenants compared to a much smaller number of landlords.
“It’s such a massive constituency that I struggle to understand why legislators, so many of them, seem to recognize landlords as a constituency with shared concerns, but don’t seem to recognize tenants as a constituency,” Melonakos-Harrison said.
The statewide Connecticut Tenants Union has gaining political power for the past few years, formalizing its structure and increasing lobbying activities. But lobbying groups representing landlords maintain a more established presence in the state Capitol.
While the bill was under consideration, some Connecticut residents received phone calls asking them to oppose the measure. “Imagine living next to someone who makes you feel unsafe, and there is nothing you can do about it. Can we count on you to oppose this bill?” one caller said.
House leadership earlier this month said support had been difficult to gather within the party caucus. Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he’d fielded concerns from lawmakers who feared that if new owners couldn’t evict renters, they wouldn’t be able to make renovations and rental housing would deteriorate.
Members of the Democratic caucus also raised concerns that it would be hard for landlords to evict “bad tenants,” Ritter said. Landlords have repeatedly raised the same issue — that if someone is smoking or being disruptive, it’s sometimes easier to evict them through a no-fault eviction. 
“You have people saying, ‘If you don’t incentivize people to come in, and then they can’t charge higher rents, they’re going to let their buildings be decrepit, deteriorate, and then flip it,” Ritter said. “And we could not solve that in the caucus. That was probably the single biggest issue.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said it’s a tough balance to strike between tenants’ rights and landlord issues.
Republican lawmakers broadly opposed the bill.
“I had serious concerns with this same proposal last year, which would have established a general right for any tenant to remain in a rental unit after a lease term expires in perpetuity. It didn’t even come up for a vote in the House because it’s a problematic concept,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, in a text message after the launch of the just cause campaign.
Sen. Rob Sampson of Wolcott, ranking member of the Housing Committee, has said the bill would violate landlords’ rights and that government shouldn’t encroach on private contracts like leases.
It wasn’t clear whether Gov. Ned Lamont supported the bill. At a recent press briefing, he gave what he admitted was a neutral response when questioned about his stance.
“Look, rents are going up a lot,” Lamont said. “There’s a lot of sudden shock. A lot of people are at risk of losing a place to stay. So I understand the worry about that. You also want to get a balance and make sure we have people continuing to invest in a state like this with rental units.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0203_SR_HousingPolicy207-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

(Photo by Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Lake Mead’s infamous bathtub ring is expected to get bigger this summer as low snowpack levels in the Rocky Mountains choke the reservoir’s biggest source of water – the Colorado River.
Snow melt from the Rocky Mountains contributes about 85% of the total water flow in the Colorado River, but those flows will likely be lower than usual this summer, according to federal data.
Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks.
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year.
Utah Gov. Cox issues drought executive order, urges Utahns to conserve water

A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The snow pack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said.
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too.
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.
Stalled talks and a problematic pipeline
The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are currently working on setting rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Representatives Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.
The office of Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A troubled Southern New Mexico utility scrutinized for recent arsenic violations has just logged yet another one, prompting state environmental officials to evaluate taking rare emergency action.
The Camino Real Regional Utility Authority manages drinking water and sewage for approximately 19,000 people in the southern portion of Doña Ana County, Sunland Park and Santa Teresa. The area has high levels of naturally occurring arsenic in the groundwater, which can cause cancers and other health threats over years of exposure.
After a series of water quality issues in late 2023, state investigators found the utility had bypassed its arsenic treatment systems and sent water with high-level of arsenic to residents, in addition to dozens of other violations. New CRRUA leadership said it had addressed those violations, but recently self-reported arsenic levels in the water at one plant that violate the federal standards.
Last week, Doña Ana County commissioners voted unanimously to terminate its role in the utility’s governance, as residents and the state’s environment secretary continue to criticize the utility’s lack of accountability.
New Mexico’s environment secretary urges Sunland Park to cut ties with troubled water utility

Now, the state Environment Department reports that water tests the agency itself took at CCRUA on May 7 recorded arsenic levels at the Santa Teresa Industrial Park plant that violated the federal limit.
This marks the third overage recorded at the plant in recent weeks, although the other tests were from voluntary tests.
Because of the ways contaminants are measured — using a quarterly average —  the state has little regulatory authority to intervene unless further violations are recorded, NMED Water Protection Division Director Jonas Armstrong told SourceNM.
“We’ve encouraged the system to do what community groups are asking, in terms of providing onsite treatment, test strips and things like that at no cost to the ratepayers,” he said.
Thus, Jonas said, NMED is now looking at the standards for enacting emergency powers to address “immediate and substantial endangerment.”
“This is a system that has had issues with water quality for years,” he said. ”Every single instance where we find continuing evidence of that is additionally concerning, and so it is potentially, an area when the emergency authority could be exercised.”
Officials confirmed it would be the first time the state has used these specific emergency powers for drinking water in recent memory, although the department has enacted the authority in other situations, such as concern for hazardous waste.
Those powers, laid out in both state and federal law, could mean ordering CRRUA to provide alternate water supplies, or open a civil lawsuit for further action.
Charles de Saillan, a longtime environmental attorney in New Mexico, told Source NM the federal law requires the agency to determine first if there’s an imminent and substantial threat to human health.
“The environment department would have the burden, if it took the case to court, or issued an order and that order was challenged, to prove that there was an imminent and substantial endangerment,” he said.
Source NM calls, emails and texts to CRRUA Executive Director Juan Carlos Crosby and spokesperson Udell Vigil went unreturned Monday.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9851-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

(Courtesy of USGS EROS Center)A preliminary budget request from President Donald Trump takes aim at a satellite program with a 50-year history whose data is housed just northeast of Sioux Falls, at a facility employing hundreds of people.
Trump’s discretionary budget request for NASA would cut $1.1 billion in funding for Earth observation programs, including what the request describes as cuts to the “gold-plated, two billion dollar Landsat Next” mission. The cut amounts to roughly half of the space agency’s budget for Earth observation, which includes money for Landsat design.
Landsat Next is planned as the next generation of Landsat, whose nine iterations have created the longest continuously collected Earth observation record in history. The first satellite launched in 1972.
NASA builds and launches Landsat satellites. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates them and curates the data collected by them. 

  Powerful storms containing heavy rains caused major flooding to areas in the east central portion of the United States in early April 2025. Some communities in Kentucky saw more than 15 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. In the days following April 7 — the day Landsat 8 captured this imagery over a portion of the affected area — the Kentucky and Ohio rivers were forecast to reach historic levels and crest in dozens of locations. (Courtesy USGS Landsat program)

The USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center near Sioux Falls has housed Landsat data since 1973, in addition to millions of images from other satellites and modern and historical aerial imagery, all of which is accessible at no cost to users. Landsat’s free data is used to calibrate data from commercial satellites, contributing to what the USGS calculated last fall as a $25.6 billion return on public investment since the agency began freely sharing data in 2008.
The most recent satellite in the series, Landsat 9, entered low-earth orbit in 2021. Between that satellite and its near-identical predecessor, Landsat 8, the system gathers new imagery data of the entire Earth’s surface — as well as imagery from spectral bands like infrared that are invisible to the naked eye and measurements of Earth surface temperatures — every eight days.
Landsat Next was set to launch around 2030, with improvements in resolution and speedier repeat image collection.
Trump’s budget request would “restructure” the Landsat Next mission “while NASA studies more affordable ways to maintain the continuity of Landsat imagery, which is used by natural resource managers, States, and industry.”
The request also calls for the elimination of $562 million in USGS funding. The change “eliminates programs that provide grants to universities, duplicate other Federal research programs and focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change) to instead focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals,” Trump’s budget request says. 
The cut to USGS amounts to about a third of its $1.6 billion budget.
The budget request is separate from the federal government’s efforts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to pare down the federal workforce. 
Probationary employees across multiple federal agencies were first dismissed in February, but many returned to the federal payroll and placed on paid administrative leave after legal challenges.
It’s unclear how those moves to reduce the federal workforce have impacted the EROS Center.
Around 600 government employees and contractors work at the center, according to the latest figures posted on the USGS website, but the site including that figure hasn’t changed since March 2023.
Emails from South Dakota Searchlight to USGS press contacts at EROS and in regional and national offices on the number of employees who’ve departed since Jan. 25 went unanswered.
The biggest thing you’ve never heard of: How EROS changed the world from a cornfield

Searchlight also asked about the potential impact of the USGS budget cut proposal to EROS science programs, and about how changes to the Landsat program could affect EROS.
A NASA spokesperson told South Dakota Searchlight that the agency would be in a better position to respond “once we receive the President’s full budget request in the coming weeks.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, pointed out that presidential budget requests are “aspirational” and “rarely implemented as written.”
“Dusty will continue to be supportive of Landsat’s efforts in Congress,” said a Johnson spokesperson.
The NASA budget has not emerged as a discussion point in budget reconciliation talks underway in Washington, D.C., on Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, sounded similar notes in his response to questions about Landsat. 
“The president’s discretionary budget is just that — discretionary. It outlines the president’s priorities and wish lists, but it will ultimately be our job in Congress to set the budget and appropriate federal dollars,” Rounds said in an emailed statement.
Representatives for Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return emails requesting comment on Landsat and EROS.
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told Searchlight during a visit to Sioux Falls recently that he hadn’t heard about requested cuts to the satellite program or to the USGS.
Even so, Rhoden said he trusts that an open relationship with the Trump administration on South Dakota’s priorities will help preserve them through budget negotiations.

“They give you some wiggle room as far as what your priorities are, and so I’m kind of optimistic that they are tempering some of those decisions with common sense,” Rhoden said.
Trump’s actions have had at least one public impact on EROS, though not an operational one.
EROS is home to a supercomputer whose processing power is shared across multiple arms of the Department of Interior. The system came to EROS with the name Denali, named after the tallest peak in the U.S. 
Like the Alaska mountain after which the computer was named, the Denali system at EROS was renamed “McKinley” after the issuance of a Trump executive order.
Denali has long been the mountain’s name among Alaska’s Indigenous Athabascans, but the federal government embraced the name given to it by a prospector for about 100 years. The prospector called it “Mount McKinley,” after then-presidential candidate William McKinley.
President Barack Obama renamed it Denali in 2015, matching the name the surrounding national park had taken nearly 40 years earlier.
The order does not mention the USGS or supercomputers, but rather instructs the Department of Interior to “update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.”
The EROS supercomputer’s name was changed based on the order, however.
“Pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order No. 14172, ‘Restoring Names that Honor American Greatness,’ this supercomputer has been renamed to McKinley,” a poster in the EROS visitor area now reads.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Six cities in the Front Range filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Gov. Jared Polis claiming recently approved state housing laws violate the Colorado Constitution’s home rule provisions. 
The 86-page lawsuit filed in Denver District Court Monday says Colorado courts have established that matters of land use and zoning are “core matters of local concern,” and that home rule cities are “not inferior” to the Colorado Legislature. Colorado has 105 municipalities with home rule power, meaning they can make laws on matters of local concern instead of being directed by the state.
The General Assembly approved two laws in 2024 that are subject to the lawsuit: one that allows for denser housing close to transit stops and another that prohibits minimum parking requirements. The lawsuit also challenges an executive order Polis signed Friday to incentivize municipalities to comply with new state housing laws if they want to receive discretionary grant funding.

Housing availability and affordability has been a growing crisis in Colorado that state legislators have sought to address since 2023, when a major land use package failed on the last day of the legislative session. A 2023 housing executive order Polis signed said the state is short tens of thousands of housing units, and his latest order said the same concerns continue to escalate. 
Plaintiff cities include Greenwood Village, Arvada, Aurora, Glendale, Lafayette and Westminster. The lawsuit outlines each of the cities’ zoning and land use approval processes and how they have increased their own efforts to build more affordable housing, and how abiding by the new state laws would disrupt their approval processes. 
The cities argue the new laws won’t immediately lead to an increase in affordable housing and that a one-size-fits-all approach to zoning isn’t appropriate for the cities in the Denver metro area. They also said the laws’ requirements take away a citizen’s right to be heard on land use issues as each new potential development is reviewed at the city level.  
The lawsuit says provisions of the Colorado Constitution mandate court declarations that the two new laws “have neither force nor effect in the Cities,” and it asks for injunctive relief barring enforcement of the laws. In particular, it says House Bill 24-1313 — related to transit-oriented housing — “departs from time-tested approaches to resolving local land-use decisions” in Colorado.
“In a move without precedent in Colorado’s history of planning and zoning, the General Assembly mandated site-specific zoning changes in select urban Colorado communities, including the Cities, that the General Assembly dubbed ‘transit-oriented communities,’” the lawsuit says. 
Defendants include the state, Polis, the Department of Local Affairs and DOLA Executive Director Maria De Cambra. Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman said Polis is “confident” a court will rule in favor of the state, and he is proud to have worked together with many local governments to work toward solving the state’s housing shortage. 
“It’s disappointing to see certain local governments that have among the priciest homes in Colorado use taxpayer money on a lawsuit that could go toward lowering the cost of housing,” Wieman said in a statement. “It’s clear this lawsuit is about preventing more housing from being built that Coloradans can afford. Rather than standing in the way of more housing being built, Governor Polis and the General Assembly have passed common-sense laws that break down barriers to housing. 
The lawsuit seeks declarations that both laws violate certain articles of the Colorado Constitution, violate due process, and that Polis’ executive order exceeds the governor’s powers.

Government […],"The Iowa Supreme Court chamber in the Iowa Judicial Building on Feb. 22, 2023. (Photo by Kathie Obradovich/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Iowa Supreme Court gave citizen engagement and accessibility to public meetings a much-needed boost Friday in an appeal of a lawsuit against the Iowa City Community School District.
The district’s practice of posting full videos of school board meetings on the internet for on-demand public viewing was at the heart of the case.
Government officials, staffs of statewide organizations of cities, counties and school boards, and access advocates like the Iowa Freedom of Information Council had awaited the decision with some trepidation. They worried the court might impose liability for statements expressed during public comment portions of governmental meetings and for their republication via internet posting of meeting recordings on government web sites or YouTube.
But the justices unanimously upheld lower court decisions dismissing the claims by Amie Villarini, the former girls’ tennis coach at Iowa City West High School.
The Supreme Court ruling should curtail a recent practice by an increasing number of public officials who advocated that the risk of defamation lawsuits made it necessary for city councils and school boards to omit or limit public comment periods during their meetings, to warn speakers in advance about what they could and could not say, and even to remove or arrest speakers who made crude or demeaning comments.
The court decision takes away any rational basis for a governmental body to claim it should not archive recordings of meetings for later public viewing.
The Iowa City case arose because the school district is among the governmental bodies that did not cower to pressure to limit members of the public from speaking their minds, lodging complaints, or heaping praise during meetings. The district also did not give in to pressure to closet away video recordings of meetings that captured those comments.
Villarini’s lawsuit in effect challenged both practices. She sued over statements by two former West High School tennis players who spoke freely during the public-comment time at a 2022 school board meeting.
The students expressed disappointment with the results of an internal school investigation of allegations of mistreatment involving the tennis coach, whom the girls did not identify by name. One girl told the board she believed the investigation protected the coach, not students. The other girl asked the board to change the district’s investigation procedures to protect students better.
Board members did not respond to the girls’ statements. The following day, the district placed Villarini on paid leave for the remainder of her one-year contract. The deputy superintendent said school staff learned after the meeting Villarini had posted comments the administrator described as unprofessional and disrespectful to students.
In keeping with its custom, the district posted a complete, unaltered video recording of the school board meeting on its YouTube channel two days after the meeting. The district refused multiple requests from Villarini and her lawyer to take the video down.
She sued, alleging the district defamed her by republishing what she called “slanderous” statements by the two girls. The district defended the case, in part arguing that posting unaltered video of a public meeting of a governmental body constituted privileged speech.
The Supreme Court agreed. Chief Justice Susan Christensen wrote in the decision:
“The fair-report privilege protects the publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern … if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.”
The court continued: “Although we are fully articulating this privilege for the first time, we have recognized a version of it since the early 1900s. At the time, the privilege only covered judicial proceedings and could be defeated by a showing of malice. … Here, we are expanding the privilege and updating it so that it covers the report of more proceedings and is defeated by inaccuracy instead of malice.”
The court said it may have reached a different conclusion had the district edited the meeting recording. Yet, the court reiterated the importance of supporting steps that increase public access to governmental meetings.
“The application of the fair-report privilege to this case furthers Iowa’s open-meeting laws. … Government entities, including school boards, must prioritize the accessibility of public meetings,” the court wrote.
“ICCSD [Iowa City Community School District] has chosen to comply with these laws with the most transparency possible, and that should not be punished. The fair-report privilege protects those government bodies that provide the public with a full account of their meetings.”
Thankfully, the Supreme Court did not mince words when it ratified that comments at a public meeting are privileged communications and that posting recordings of those comments is protected so long as the posted version is unaltered.
This common sense support of citizen participation in and access to governments continues Iowa’s history of openness and its protection of free speech, while adapting state law to current realities.
Letting people watch live-streamed governmental board meetings and archived recordings of past meetings from their homes, offices — or even their tractor cabs — is a positive result from the Covid pandemic, when many people avoided large gatherings.
Citizens without transportation, parents with children at home, the elderly, or people away from home learned to use Zoom or YouTube to watch their school boards and city council meetings when they could and from remote locations.
By applying the fair-report privilege to meetings live-streamed or archived on the internet, even when they contain untoward comments, our Supreme Court has modernized an important protection for expressive rights of Iowans and articulated how the distribution of full-length recordings of meetings promotes government transparency.
With this Supreme Court endorsement, city councils, school boards and county boards of supervisors that persist in opening their meetings only to in-person attendees serve only themselves, not the public. Even more, the court’s decision strips away a convenient but now dispelled legal excuse for elected officials to avoid doing the right thing.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)The American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio is suing the Geauga County Sheriff’s office over its refusal to provide copies of contracts it’s signed with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Geauga is one of at least five counties in Ohio that have signed contracts to house migrants detained by ICE on the belief that they’re undocumented.
The ACLU on Tuesday afternoon filed a writ in the Ohio Supreme Court asking the court to mandate the release of the contracts. In a statement, the civil liberties group said that in April the sheriff’s office claimed that releasing the records was “‘prohibited by federal law’ and therefore not public per the Ohio Revised Code. (The ACLU) was instructed to instead contact ICE for the records.”
Under such contracts, the federal government pays counties to house detainees. During the first Trump administration, the Ohio counties that housed detainees faced complaints and lawsuits.
The ACLU’s statement said that the office didn’t cite a valid reason not to release its ICE contract.
Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

“None of the federal statutes (the county’s lawyers) have cited, however, prohibit the disclosure of the requested records,” the writ said. “Because (the county’s lawyers) have refused to perform their clearly defined duty to provide the requested records, (the ACLU) respectfully submits this complaint for alternative and peremptory writs of mandamus to require (the sheriff’s office) to provide her with the records she seeks.” 
Geauga County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Thomas Rowan said the county’s attorneys are telling a different story — that only ICE can release the documents.
“It’s in our attorneys’ hands,” he said. “Once the court rules, we’ll definitively know which way to go. Our attorneys believe that they have to go through ICE to get copies of any of the paperwork.”
As a general matter, government documents can usually only be withheld or redacted if they contain sensitive personal information, business secrets, or if their disclosure would endanger public safety or national security.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
A wave of state and national public records laws were passed in the wake of the Watergate scandal to crack down on government corruption. Documents relating to the expenditure of government dollars were a particular target of such laws. 
As Trump promises mass deportations, the ACLU said it would try to keep a close watch.
“The ACLU of Ohio is deeply committed to protecting immigrants’ rights and our organization serves as a watchdog for government transparency and accountability,” Jocelyn Rosnick, Chief Policy and Advocacy Officer, said in a written statement. “We know that Geauga County Jail has housed ICE detainees for years, some of whom we have previously defended in court. Our lawful demands for timely and accurate information must not be ignored.”

Tate Reeves asked the Trump administration for a major disaster declaration on April 1. The state, and residents, are still waiting.","by Sophie Bates, Associated Press
TYLERTOWN, Miss. (AP) — More than two months after a tornado destroyed his home, Brian Lowery still looks through the rubble, hoping to find a tie clip his mother gave him, made from the center stone of her wedding band.
“I still have hope,” Lowery said.
He, his wife and 13-year-old son made it to safety before the tornado ripped apart their trailer home of 15 years, but the recovery from the storm has been a slow and painful process. Mississippi’s request for federal aid is still pending before the Federal Emergency Management Agency, meaning badly needed assistance has not yet made it to his hard-hit community of Tylertown to recover from the storms that struck in mid-March.
The delays could provide a glimpse into what’s in store for communities around the country as the summer storm season arrives and FEMA is mired in turmoil. A stretch of states including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma have already been battered with tornadoes this week, setting the stage for more disaster requests to FEMA. And the Atlantic hurricane season is just around the corner.March storms left 7 dead and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged
In Mississippi, nearly 20 tornadoes tore through the state on March 14 and 15, leaving seven people dead and hundreds of homes destroyed or damaged. Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves asked the Trump administration for a major disaster declaration on April 1. The state, and residents like Lowery, are still waiting.
The declaration would allow the state to access a wide range of FEMA resources, including financial aid for individuals and for government agencies still removing debris and repairing infrastructure.
“I don’t know what you got to do or what you got to have to be able to be declared for a federal disaster area because this is pretty bad,” Lowery said. “We can’t help you because, whatever, we’re waiting on a letter; we’re waiting on somebody to sign his name. You know, all that. I’m just over it.”
The declaration would allow the state to access a wide range of FEMA resources, including financial aid for individuals and for government agencies still removing debris and repairing infrastructure.
“We don’t have a declaration yet. People are still hurting,” said Royce McKee, emergency management director for Walthall County, which includes Tylertown.Requests for help come at a time of upheaval for FEMA

Mississippi’s request comes at a time of upheaval for FEMA. The agency’s acting administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was recently ousted after he publicly disagreed with proposals to dismantle FEMA, an idea President Donald Trump has floated in calling the agency “very bureaucratic” and “very slow.”
David Richardson, FEMA’s new acting administrator, committed himself to executing Trump’s vision for the agency. He also previewed potential policy changes, saying there could be “more cost-sharing with states” and that FEMA would coordinate federal assistance “when deemed necessary.”
Walthall County was hit especially hard by the massive storm system that wreaked havoc across multiple states. The storm spawned two significant tornadoes in the county, where four people died.
McKee said the county has sunk an estimated $700,000 into cleaning up the damage but can’t afford to spend more and has halted operations until it receives federal help.
“We need federal help, and we need it desperately, and we need it now,” said Bobby McGinnis, a Tylertown resident and firefighter. “I know President Trump said that — America first, we’re going to help our American folks first. But we haven’t seen the federal folks down here.”
While Mississippi has been waiting, a similar major disaster declaration request out of Arkansas after the storms hit was denied, appealed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and finally approved on May 13.
“We are encouraged by FEMA’s decision regarding Arkansas’ application from the same storm system that hit Mississippi,” Scott Simmons, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency’s director of external affairs, said in a statement. “We anxiously await a positive decision.”In Missouri, there are frustrations about the federal response to March storms
In Missouri, the federal response to storms earlier this year is being criticized as residents pick up the pieces from a Friday twister. The EF3 tornado packing winds of up to 150 mph (241 kph) slammed into St. Louis on Friday, and the city is awaiting a disaster declaration from the Missouri governor’s office so it can access federal help.
“We need to get the federal government mobilized,” said U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican. “All federal resources that can be brought to bear here should be.”
The senator also expressed frustration over the federal response to a deadly March storm.
“We cannot wait months. I’m not happy about the fact we’re still waiting from all of that damage two months ago. We lost 12 people in those storms. We’ve lost seven here,” he said. “The scope of the damage is immense.”Mississippi lawmakers press federal officials about assistance
Mississippi lawmakers have been pressing federal officials on the issue. During a congressional hearing in early May, Republican Mississippi Rep. Michael Guest asked U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose department oversees FEMA, to push forward the request.
“I would ask you if you could make sure that you could do everything to expedite that request,” Guest said. ”It is impacting my local jurisdictions with debris cleanup. It is impacting people as they seek to recover.”
Republican Mississippi U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith also asked Noem about FEMA assistance and the administration’s new approach to the agency.
“President Trump has been very clear that he believes that the way that FEMA exists today should not continue,” Noem responded. “He wants to make sure that those reforms are happening where states are empowered to do the response and trained and equipped, and then the federal government would come in and support them and financially be there when they need them on their worst day.”

(Getty Images)Five years after medical cannabis became available in Utah after being legalized by voters, the program, while still controversial, keeps on growing. This year, the state counted over 100,000 medical cannabis card holders, a new peak in the program’s five-year existence.
Members of the Utah Patients Coalition, a plant medicine advocacy group which lobbied hard to help pass the 2018 referendum that allowed the medical cannabis program in deeply conservative Utah, see the milestone as a demonstration that the system to obtain a card is getting easier to navigate.
Even now that a major 2025 cannabis bill has gone into effect and eliminated a system that allowed for a cheaper, more accessible way to obtain a card, the group remains hopeful for the future of medical cannabis in the state.
“The growth in 2025 has been encouraging, just because we have seen a lot of patients struggling in the past. And every year we go back to the legislative session, we go back to our platforms with education, and just try to remove some of those barriers,” Desiree Hennessy, executive director at the Utah Patients Coalition, said on Monday.
 Utah Legislature still making tweaks on state’s medical cannabis law

One of the 2025 general session’s routine bipartisan medical cannabis bills, sponsored by Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, and Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, went through several iterations and proposed allowing more medical cannabis pharmacies in the state. But, it didn’t make it to a vote on the Senate floor, ultimately failing.
However, Senate Bill 64, another bill sponsored by Vickers, passed, containing a provision that Utah Patients Coalition considered “a heartbreaking loss.”
Up until this month, pharmacies were allowed to partner with clinics that have medical providers qualified to prescribe medicinal cannabis to host “card drives,” a sort of pop-up clinic in pharmacies’ parking lots in which doctors could see patients and issue cards, often at a discount.
Those partnerships allowed cards, which are good for up to a year, to go from a regular $200 to about $75, Hennessy said.
“This year, we lost the ability to allow pharmacies to do that. So now no longer can somebody write a card within 500 feet of a pharmacy unless they’re in their own business,” she said. “And so it’s really not going to hurt anybody that’s middle class or higher, but these patients struggling with finances that used these card drives.”
That was one of the last additions to Vickers’ bill. He explained on the Senate floor that the bill’s authors didn’t feel like the pop-ups were appropriate, and patients should be going to a doctor’s office for medical advice.
“If someone is a qualified medical professional, they can’t go to a pop-up tent in front of the marijuana pharmacy to give cards. We want to make sure that we are not producing a recreational environment,” SB64’s House floor sponsor, Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St George, told House members about the change.
But, with that loss, also came some flexibility on who gets to recommend medical cannabis to a patient. Now, medical providers who are licensed to prescribe controlled substances can recommend the treatment, which according to a Department of Health and Human Services April report is mostly used to treat pain.
According to Hennessy, that change would improve patient accessibility.
“Patients can go to their regular care physician, hopefully not get charged any more than a co-pay, and have this medical cannabis conversation with their doctor,” she said.
While advocates celebrate the numbers, the program remains a contentious point among Utahns, with some still protesting the annual technical bills, arguing that the state shouldn’t allow cannabis at all.
But, ultimately, Hennessy hopes that medical cannabis patients get to be treated like those receiving any other treatment. Especially, she said, since the program has been demonstrated to lower rates of opioid use and opioid-related deaths, according to a study by Management Science Associates in partnership with Dragonfly Wellness, a medical cannabis pharmacy.
“We do believe that there’s a lot of good that can come out of using medical cannabis as a first-line drug, and not as a second or third or fourth when everything else fails,” Hennessy said, “but we could use this first and treat a lot of conditions with a lot less risk than other medications that patients are now using.”

Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks.
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year.
 ‘Extreme and exceptional drought’ expected for Southern Nevada this year

A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
“The snowpack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said.
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too.
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.

 Stalled talks among Colorado River Basin states and a problematic pipeline

The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are working to set rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Reps. Greg Stanton, D-Arizona, and Susie Lee, D-Nevada, said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.

Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.

He plans to file and appeal regarding his execution within a couple of weeks claiming that he did not assault Lane. (Alabama Department of Corrections)An Alabama death row inmate plans to represent himself in a final appeal of his sentence, weeks before his execution.
Gregory Hunt, convicted of the 1998 murder and sexual assault of Karen Lane, will argue that he killed but did not sexually assault Lane, which would reduce his charge from capital murder to murder and make him ineligible for the death penalty.
“I think that Greg is at peace no matter what happens,” Pastor Jeff Hood, who works with inmates on Alabama’s death row, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “I think he is prepared to die no matter what happens, but he wants people to know that he is sorry for killing Karen Lane but that he did not sexually assault her.”
Messages were sent to both the Governor’s Office and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office on Tuesday seeking comment.
Hunt was convicted on three counts of capital murder by a jury in 1990 and by an 11-1 vote, recommended that he be put to death.  Two of the counts alleged Hunt sexually assaulted Lane; the other said Hunt killed her during a robbery.
The first count dealt with killing Lane during the course of a robbery while the other two counts related to allegations that he sexually abused her.
Federal and state courts in recent years have been unwilling to stop Alabama executions, even in the face of evidence of prior issues with capital punishment in the state.
Hunt, who plans to represent himself, will ask the court to delay his execution and argue his trial attorneys did not present mitigating circumstances from his background or evidence that he did not sexually assault Lane.
He has stated similar claims in his appeals in the past that were rejected by the courts.
According to Hood, Hunt is only challenging capital murder charges related to sexual abuse allegations and not the one pertaining to the robbery.
“When you look at the transcripts, the primary aggravating factor they (prosecutors) focused on was sexual assault,” Hood said. “And this is the problem with these cases. The state gets to move the goalposts.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gregory-Hunt-horizontal-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-20 15:08:14.099030

(Photo Courtesy Mora County Sheriff's Office)Six New Mexico counties and the Mescalero Apache Reservation imposed new fire restrictions Monday, citing high wildfire risk in various parts of the state. 
In total, according to the New Mexico Forestry Division, 23 towns, counties, tribal or other jurisdictions across the state have imposed some level of fire restriction due to high fire risk. The division has a map here showing much of the state under some type of burn ban, including federal and state forests. 
“In the face of significant wildfire potential, we need every New Mexican to take active steps to reduce the likelihood of an accidental wildfire start,” State Forester Laura McCarthy said in a statement. “These restrictions are needed because of current wildfire threats and the rising probability of dangerous wildfires as temperatures warm through May and June.”
Forecasters predicted earlier this month that southeastern New Mexico, including the Gila National Forest, would experience above-normal wildfire risk in May that would grow to cover the eastern two thirds of New Mexico by June. A national drought update issued Tuesday said a warm, dry spring had led to intensification of drought conditions in the Intermountain West region, with the worst conditions in New Mexico and Arizona.
So far this year, 377 wildfires in New Mexico have burned more than 33,500 acres, though the vast majority of those fires burned less than an acre. The biggest wildfire this year, so far, the Mogote Hill Fire, burned a little more than 21,000 acres near Wagon Mound in mid-March. 
Of the 377 fires, 275 were human-caused, 26 were naturally caused and causes of the remaining 76 are still being determined, according to the Southwest Coordination Center.
The fire restrictions are in place as most of the state experiences some form of drought. According to the Office of the State Engineer, all but 3.8% of New Mexico is in drought, with 41% in extreme drought and 7.5% in exceptional drought. 
Stage I fire restrictions generally prohibit building a fire in an area other than a developed campsite or picnic area, along with smoking outside of a vehicle or building. State II restrictions also prohibit discharging a firearm, operating an internal combustion engine, welding or using explosives. 
Nowhere in New Mexico is currently under the most severe fire restriction, in which entire areas are closed to the public to prevent wildfires.

The ban related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was announced Monday during a daylong visit to the Cornhusker state by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.

Rollins, accompanied by Gov. Jim Pillen on her three-stop tour, was following through on a request Pillen had made earlier. She said the waiver she signed while in Fremont was the first approved by the USDA. It becomes effective Jan. 1.
Pillen, in a news conference last month, said he planned to submit a request for the federal waiver to remove the drink items he describes as unhealthy “junk.”
 ‘First of its kind’

“There’s absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,” said Pillen.
Rollins called the move “historic” and, in a statement, called Pillen a pioneer, along with the governors of six other states, in improving health in the nation. The waiver amends the definition of food products to be purchased by SNAP benefits, excluding soda, soft drinks, and energy drinks.
“Today’s waiver to remove soda and energy drinks from SNAP is the first of its kind, and it is a historic step to Make America Healthy Again,” Rollins said, adopting the phrasing popularized by the Trump administration’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Rollins’ visit and approval of the move came the same day the Nebraska Legislature upheld a Pillen veto of a bill that sought to lift a lifetime ban on SNAP benefits for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies.
Lawmakers back Pillen veto, kill bill to lift lifetime ban on food aid for some with drug pasts 

Both measures received instant criticism from nonprofits that work low-income families and inmates reentering their communities. 
Eric Savaiano, manager for food and nutrition access for Nebraska Appleseed, said SNAP is designed to “maintain the dignity” of participants by helping low-paid people buy groceries. He called the latest SNAP ban “poverty-shaming.”
“With the approval of this waiver, some of that dignity is stripped away,” Savaino said.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, or about 7.5% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, including seniors, children, people with disabilities, working families and veterans. Nebraska Appleseed said the average SNAP benefit received in the state is about $5.82 per person per day.
Savaiano, in a statement, said research shows SNAP recipients buy the same things as everyone else, including soda, soft drinks and energy drinks. “By targeting just SNAP participants, we’re poverty-shaming the most vulnerable among us and adding complications to an already complicated system.” 
He said carrying out the restriction would cause extra expenses to grocers, and he worried that could cause smaller stores to stop serving SNAP recipients altogether, and possibly shut off options in some rural areas.
 ‘Nothing nutritious’ 

Pillen said SNAP is to help families in need get “healthy food into their diets” and that there is “nothing nutritious” about the drinks to be ruled out under the waiver.
“We have to act because we can’t keep letting Nebraskans starve in the midst of plenty,” Pillen said.
Also with Rollins and Pillen during the Nebraska ag tour was Sherry Vinton, director of Nebraska’s Department of Agriculture and U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb. 
The group stopped at the Cargill Bioscience 650-acre facility in Blair, Wholestone Farms in Fremont and the Ohnoutka Family Farm in Valparaiso.

LaMonica McIver was “out of control” while speaking to reporters on the Hill Tuesday.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver said a new federal felony charge won't force her to ""roll over and stop doing my job."" (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Rep. LaMonica McIver acted as a human shield to thwart the May 9 arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an immigration detention center in Newark, federal authorities say in new court documents. 
An eight-page criminal complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey Monday formally charges McIver (D-10) with two felony counts of assaulting officers during Baraka’s arrest. The complaint includes multiple stills captured by body cameras that the Department of Justice says show her striking, grabbing, and pushing the officers.
The charges against McIver have led to complaints from her fellow Democrats that the Trump administration is weaponizing the justice system to target his political foes. President Donald Trump claimed McIver was “out of control” while speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., Tuesday. 
“The days of woke are over. That woman, I have no idea who she is. That woman was out of control. She was shoving federal agents. She was out of control,” Trump said. “The days of that crap are over in this country. We’re going to have law and order.”
McIver has called the charges “purely political,” and said she was at the detention center that day as part of her congressional oversight duties.
“I’m not going to roll over and stop doing my job because they, you know, don’t want me to, or they want to neglect the fact that we needed to be in there to see what was going on in that detention center,” McIver said in an interview on CNN Tuesday.

Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges against McIver on Monday, the same day she said she would drop a trespassing charge her office had filed against Baraka.
The charges stem from a visit McIver made to Delaney Hall, a newly opened migrant jail in Newark that Baraka has said is operating illegally without proper city permits. McIver, along with Democratic Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, said they wanted to inspect the facility. Baraka was also present.
According to statements made in the criminal complaint by Robert Tansey, a special agent at the Department of Homeland Security’s investigations agency in Newark, the mayor initially entered the property because guards thought he was a member of Congress. An agent approached the mayor and ordered him to leave the facility’s secure area, warning him he would be arrested if he did not do so, the complaint says.
Video shows Baraka exiting the property to join protestors on the other side of the gate separating the street from the detention center. Federal agents then moved to arrest him, and, according to the complaint, McIver started to shout, “Hell no! Hell no! Hell no!”
McIver, Watson Coleman, and other protestors circled the mayor, and during the scuffle that ensued, McIver pushed past a federal agent and pushing another on his shoulder, according to video of the episode.
McIver is represented by one of Habba’s predecessors, Paul Fishman.
“The decision to charge Congresswoman McIver is spectacularly inappropriate. She went to Delaney Hall to do her job. As a member of Congress, she has the right and responsibility to see how ICE is treating detainees. Rather than facilitating that inspection, ICE agents chose to escalate what should have been a peaceful situation into chaos. This prosecution is an attempt to shift the blame for ICE’s behavior to Congresswoman McIver. In the courtroom, facts — not headlines — will matter,” Fishman said in a statement.

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.













School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities





In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

Emily Chenevert's House Bill 685 (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator) The Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Monday that would ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices across state government and prohibit state universities and colleges from requiring certain race and gender-based curriculum for undergraduate students. 
House Bill 685 by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, advanced from the House on a 57-32 vote, narrowly clearing the 53-vote threshold for passage. Sixteen members, including several moderate Democrats and Republicans, were absent for the vote.
In an unusual move, every Democratic lawmaker present stood together in solidarity behind the House floor lectern, while nearly every Black lawmaker took turns making speeches against the bill. 
“To me, this is an anti-Black bill,” Rep. Edmond Jordan of Baton Rouge said. “It’s not just divisive. It’s offensive.”
“This is the most racially oppressive piece of legislation that I think I’ve seen,” Rep. Candace Newell of New Orleans said. 
Republican Reps. Beth Billings of Deshrehan, Vincent Cox of Gretna and Jeff Wiley of Maurepas joined Democrats in opposing the bill. 
“It was needlessly divisive,” Billings said in an interview when asked why she opposed the bill. 
In tearful comments after the speeches, Chenevert said her bill is not racist. 
“This is not divisive,” Chenevert said. “This is protecting every Louisianian. This is about equality for all.” 
Chenevert’s bill has been dramatically rewritten from her original legislation, which only banned DEI practices in state government. 
As is, the bill would prohibit required classes that cover any of the following subjects: 

Critical race theory
White fragility or white guilt
Systemic racism, institutional racism or anti-racism
Systemic bias or implicit bias 
Intersectionality
Gender identity
Allyship
Race-based reparations
Race-based privilege

Amendments added to the bill on the House floor would allow any of the subjects to be taught if it is “included at the discretion of the faculty member, is not prescribed by the institution as a program requirement, and is part of a broader pedagogical objective.” 
Opponents of the bill said even with the amendments, the legislation could have a chilling effect on faculty’s academic freedom and freedom of speech. 
The bill also makes an exception for majors, minors and certificates that are specifically related to race or gender studies. 
The Louisiana chapter of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to lawmakers Monday asking them to oppose the bill. 
“This legislation would stifle the ‘marketplace of ideas’ and infantilize our students, forcing faculty to avoid concepts the legislature dislikes and presenting only those that have gained their favor,” the letter reads. “This is antithetical to freedom in a democratic society and hurts our students as they transition into fully enfranchised citizens.” 
The Southern University Foundation, which is affiliated with Louisiana’s largest historically Black  university, also opposes the bill. 
Chenevert’s bill will next be discussed in a Senate committee.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For the first time since 2002, the Alaska Legislature has overridden the veto of a sitting governor.
With a 46-14 vote, lawmakers enacted a significant increase to Alaska’s per-student public funding formula, overriding Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s decision to reject House Bill 57. Forty votes were needed for an override. 
It was the third time in two years that the governor vetoed a significant education funding bill; lawmakers failed by a single vote to override the governor last year. A second veto earlier this year was sustained by a larger margin.
Tuesday’s vote may be the first chapter in a longer struggle between the governor and the Legislature. 
HB 57 prescribes an increase to the state’s public school funding formula, but that formula is subject to appropriations in the annual state budget. To use an analogy: If the formula is a bucket, the budget fills that bucket. 
Dunleavy has previously said he may veto some education money from the state budget, leaving the formula only partially funded.
In addition, parts of HB 57 are contingent upon the enactment of Senate Bill 113, a bill adjusting the state’s corporate income taxes. On Monday, Dunleavy implied that he will veto SB 113.
Overriding either a funding veto or a veto of SB 113 would require 45 votes.
Some legislators who voted to override the governor on Monday declined to confirm that they would override vetoes on the two funding mechanisms.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current). Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone’s side business selling guns out of his house does not prevent him from discussing and voting on an assault-style weapons ban or other gun legislation, the Rhode Island Ethics Commission decided Tuesday.
The ethics panel’s 8-1 vote follows the recommendation put forth by its expert staff, which concluded that Ciccone’s federal firearms license is not a conflict of interest with the high-profile gun legislation pending at the Rhode Island State House. The four-page opinion, presented by Staff Attorney Lynne Radiches, invoked the class exemption within the state’s ethics code, reasoning that Ciccone does not stand to benefit, or suffer, any more or less from state gun laws than the other 98 federally licensed firearms dealers in the state, including the other 79 with a Class 1 license.
Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, referenced the same exemption in his letter to the Ethics Commission asking for advice. 
Ciccone has been a licensed firearms dealer for decades. Should he recuse himself from gun debate?

Ciccone, who did not attend Tuesday’s meeting, was unaware of the commission’s decision until he was contacted by Rhode Island Current.
“I believe they looked at all the facts, and they came to their conclusion,” Ciccone said.
However, the advisory opinion comes with an important caveat: If any of the gun bills under review by the Rhode Island General Assembly, including the assault weapons ban legislation, are amended in a way that impacts Ciccone, or fellow Class 1 license holders, more than other federal firearms dealers, Ciccone should recuse himself or seek a new advisory opinion.
Ciccone, a longtime opponent to state gun restrictions, has already indicated he wants to see changes to the assault-style weapons ban in order for him to support it.
Fresh off a marathon hearing before the Senate Committee on Judiciary on May 14, Ciccone said he still has questions over the legality of the legislation as drafted. However, Ciccone declined to specify what changes he’d like to see made, or whether he intends to back the controversial issue already named a top priority by Gov. Dan McKee.
“I am waiting to see what decisions the committee is going to make, what changes the sponsor is going to make,” Ciccone said. “At this point in time, I don’t know. It’s up to the committee.”
A committee vote on the assault weapons ban bill has not been scheduled as of Tuesday.
Better late than never
Ciccone has served as a state lawmaker for 22 years, and been licensed to sell guns since the 1980s. But this was the first time he asked for ethics advice on gun-related legislation. Asked why now, Ciccone said he never served on the Senate Judiciary committee, and therefore had little sway over whether gun-related bills advanced to the full chamber.
Now, as the newly elected Senate majority leader, Ciccone is an ex-officio member on all Senate committees, meaning he can vote to advance a bill to the full chamber. 
Ethics Commissioner Christopher Callahan cast the sole vote against giving Ciccone permission to vote on gun bills, pointing to Ciccone’s leadership role as reason for his hesitation.
“My perception is that there is potential as a senior political leader that he may have greater influence on the outcome of the decision,” Callahan said in an interview after the meeting. Callahan, the retired head of the Rhode Island National Guard, was tapped by Gov. Dan McKee in April to serve on the state ethics panel.
Commissioner Hugo Ricci Jr. disagreed.
“He has one vote, the same as any other lawmaker,” Ricci said during the commission discussion. “He’s not president of the Senate.”
Some commission members questioned whether the 99 federal firearms dealers in Rhode Island is a large enough number to apply the class exemption. There is no minimum laid out in the ethics code, leaving it up to the panel to determine on a case-by-base basis whether belonging to an affected group constitutes reason to grant exception to potential conflicts of interest.
“It’s not a perfect science,” Radiches, the staff attorney, told the committee. “The big numbers, we love, like 13,000 teachers.”
“I don’t think we should get into a finite discussion with facts that are presented as to whether 99 is not enough,” Commissioner Frank Cenerini said.
The size of an affected group is one of several variables the commission must weigh when considering whether a class exemption applies. Other factors include the importance of “the function or official action being contemplated by the public official” and “the nature and degree of foreseeable impact upon the class and its individual members as a result of the official action,” according to standard language in ethics opinions that involve class exemptions.
Common Cause Rhode Island Executive Director John Marion, who attended the meeting, said he was not surprised that the panel granted permission for Ciccone to vote on gun bills, given its “liberal” application of the class exemption in recent history. 
However, Marion said he wished the panel had a more robust discussion of Ciccone’s role in leadership.
“The majority leader helps set the agenda for the chamber, deciding what bills move and what bill dies,” Marion said. “That’s part of what the ethics commission can regulate.”
Marion expects the need for ethics input on legislative conflicts of interest will increase under the new Senate leadership team, both for Ciccone and for Senate President Valarie Lawson. Lawson’s day job as president of one of the state’s two largest teachers’ unions has already prompted concern by some of her colleagues about potential conflicts of interest. She has not requested an advisory opinion from the Ethics Commission since her election on April 30, though she said at the time she was considering it.
“Out of an abundance of caution, she is in the process of formulating a question to the Ethics Commission and will be submitting it to them soon,” Greg Pare, a spokesperson for Senate leadership, said in an email Tuesday.
This story was updated to correct when Senate leaders can vote on bills in committee.

""I'm doing a lot more instruction in vocabulary and symbol explanations so that the students have that built-in understanding,"" said Howells. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.




School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities



In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside US House tax bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

Bob Ferguson on Tuesday signed into law a controversial policy requiring gun buyers to first pay for a new state permit. 
Starting in two years, House Bill 1163 will require those interested in purchasing guns to apply for a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol. Applicants must pay a fee and have completed a certified firearms safety training program within the past five years, with limited exceptions.
“Gun violence in Washington state breaks apart too many families and kills too many children,” Ferguson said. “We must put commonsense reforms into place that save lives.”
Ferguson, a Democrat, advocated for gun control in his three terms as Washington’s attorney general.
The permit system, set to take effect on May 1, 2027, goes beyond the state’s existing background checks, which also require proof of completion of a firearm safety course. Washington also has a 10-day waiting period after a gun dealer requests a background check before they can hand over the gun.
State authorities will have to approve one of these new permits if the applicant meets the criteria, as long as they aren’t the subject of an arrest warrant or barred from having guns in the first place.
The state patrol must issue the permit within 30 days, or 60 days if the applicant doesn’t have a state identification card. If an applicant feels the state wrongly denied them a permit, they can appeal in court.
The state patrol expects the new program will cost just over $20 million in the 2027-29 budget cycle. Fees collected for fingerprinting and background checks would offset the cost. The system could bring in over $35 million in the 2027-29 biennium, according to the latest fiscal analysis.
The measure passed the Legislature along party lines, with Democrats in support. 
Democrats say the law will strengthen the state’s efforts to limit gun violence and suicides. 
The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Liz Berry, D-Seattle, said the law has been a decade in the making.
“I am a mom of two young kids, and I’m someone who has lost someone I love to gun violence,” she said Tuesday. “This bill is transformative for our state, and we’re not done. We’ve got more to do.”
Republicans and gun owners counter that the law is an unconstitutional barrier to the right to bear arms, which is embedded in the state and U.S. constitutions.
Some critics insist the law will face court challenges in light of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 in which the justices ruled new gun laws need to be aligned with the nation’s “historical tradition of firearm regulation.”
About a dozen other states have such permit-to-purchase systems. Courts across the country have largely upheld them.
This month, the state Supreme Court upheld a similarly divisive ban on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines in a 7-2 ruling, but didn’t grapple with whether Washington’s law stayed true to the historical tradition. 
Opponents of that law vowed to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on Second Amendment grounds.
The new permit-to-purchase law was the primary piece of gun control legislation lawmakers approved in Olympia this year. 
Failed measures would have restricted bulk purchases of ammunition and firearms, imposed an excise tax on firearm and ammunition sales, added new requirements for weapons dealers and further limited the public places where people can carry firearms.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/guns-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

While his concerns span topics from facilitator qualifications to federal drug scheduling to child safety, his argument leans heavily on fear-based rhetoric and misinformation.
As a psychiatrist and licensed psilocybin facilitator, I offer a different view — one grounded in research, clinical experience, and a commitment to truth over alarmism.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Psilocybin’s legal status is not a measure of its safety
Niforatos argues that psilocybin is dangerous because it’s a Schedule I drug and lacks Food and Drug Administration approval. But those labels are not reliable markers of safety — they’re often shaped by outdated political bias and institutional inertia, not scientific evidence.
There is a vast body of research supporting the use of psilocybin for various psychiatric conditions. Institutions like Johns Hopkins and New York University have demonstrated its potential to treat depression, PTSD and addiction.
The FDA has approved countless psychiatric medications that carry serious risks, including increased suicidality. As a psychiatrist, I’ve treated thousands of patients whose lives were made worse by these medications — people left numb, disconnected and hopeless. I’ve seen firsthand how little those official stamps of approval can mean when these treatments not only fail to heal— but actively inflict harm.
Pointing to psilocybin’s legal status and saying that alone means it’s not safe ignores the science — and the people it’s already helping.
 Many facilitators are licensed mental health professionals
The claim that natural medicine facilitators are unqualified is not just wrong — it’s insulting. I’m a board-certified psychiatrist and licensed psilocybin facilitator. I know dozens of others across Colorado who are licensed psychologists, social workers and therapists — professionals who have spent their careers helping people heal, and who are now integrating psilocybin into their clinical practice with care and integrity.
At centers like Reflective Healing, Reset, LLC, and Rose NeuroSpa (where I practice), licensed mental health providers will soon be offering psilocybin within structured, ethical and regulated environments. A glance at their websites is enough to dispel the myth.
To call these professionals unqualified isn’t just misinformation — it’s a dismissal of the very people working to push mental health care in a more effective and humane direction.
 Healing centers are regulated — and not a danger to children
Perhaps the most absurd claim in Niforatos’ article is that psychedelic healing centers pose a danger to children. It’s vague, unsubstantiated and frankly irresponsible. These centers are not dispensaries. They’re not casual walk-in clinics. They are private, appointment-only spaces where every participant must be 21 or older by law and undergo a rigorous screening process. Children are not present, not permitted, and not remotely part of this system.
Colorado has built one of the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks for natural medicine in the country. Healing centers must adhere to strict safety standards, undergo state oversight, and follow detailed protocols set by the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. Every session is carefully planned, supervised and documented.
If anything, the system is conservative by design. It provides access to promising therapies while maintaining strong safeguards. To suggest these centers endanger youth is not only inaccurate — it’s irresponsible fear-mongering that distracts from meaningful conversations about public safety.
 Yes, Colorado is in crisis — that’s exactly why we need psilocybin
On one point, Niforatos and I agree: Colorado is facing a mental health crisis. Depression, suicide, trauma and addiction are widespread. Too many people are slipping through the cracks. And for many, traditional medicines aren’t enough.
That’s why we need to expand, not restrict, our treatments. Psilocybin is not a cure-all — no treatment is — but when used in a structured setting with trained professionals, it can offer real relief. This work isn’t being driven by fringe movements. It’s being led by hundreds of licensed professionals and state regulators who believe in psilocybin’s potential and are working to deliver it with integrity and care.
We owe it to those who are suffering to keep the door open, not slam it shut in defense of a system that’s already failing too many. There are powerful interests invested in maintaining that failure — where keeping people suffering sustains profit, and healing threatens the business model.
Now is the time to listen to the science, trust the professionals doing this work with integrity, and stay open to the promise this medicine holds.

Mark Allen Luster of Burlington is suing Iowa DNR Officer Dan Henderson, in his personal capacity, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging malicious prosecution and “blatant violations of the Fourth Amendment.”
In court records, Luster describes himself as professional hunter and land management consultant who specializes in designing hunting properties “to attract the largest and most prized buck deer” for hunting. “Luster has been incredibly successful as a professional hunter, and he has ‘bagged’ some of the most prized trophy-worthy bucks,” the lawsuit claims. “His livelihood is dependent on his reputation and his ability to maintain his hunting license.”
In the summer of 2024, Luster began developing an 82-acre hunting property that he owned with a friend through a limited liability company called CWD Research. According to the lawsuit, on Oct. 14, 2024, Luster shot a large whitetail buck with a bow and arrow on his CWD Research property. The next day, he located and harvested the deer, then posted a photo of the kill to Facebook captioned, “Checkmate!”
The same day, Henderson reportedly received an emailed complaint from a confidential informant who had seen the Facebook post and asserted there had been bait placed on the CWD Research property in violation of state law, as evidenced by aerial drone photos the informant had collected several weeks earlier.
  This photo was taken on property owned by professional hunter Mark Allen Luster of Burlington, who is suing a state DNR officer for alleged false claims that damaged Luster’s business and reputation. (Photo from U.S. District Court records.)
Henderson submitted an application for a search warrant, seeking to collect soil samples on the property to determine whether bait was being used. Henderson’s warrant application alleged there were photos showing a deer “utilizing” bait in the area, and also suggested Henderson had learned of the illegal baiting through comments someone had made in “in passing,” the lawsuit alleges.
In reality, the lawsuit claims, Henderson was trying to conceal the fact that an informant used “illegally obtained” aerial drone photos. In Iowa, it’s a crime to pilot a surveillance drone over any secure farmstead area.
“Officer Henderson either did not want to disclose that the confidential informant had illegally obtained the information that he was relying on, or he did not want to disclose that the aerial drone photos were obtained through some other improper means,” the lawsuit alleges.
A search warrant was issued allowing Henderson to collect soil samples “in front of cellular trail camera near black hunting blind” and in other nearby sites. On Oct. 16, Henderson visited the property, covered Luster’s trail camera for roughly 14 minutes, and collected samples, the lawsuit stated.
Charges filed and later dismissed
In November 2024, Henderson submitted an affidavit for a search warrant for Luster’s residence, indicating the samples collected by him had shown evidence of bait being used as suggested by the presence of sodium and the chemical DEET. The lawsuit alleges both substances can be explained by factors other than bait.
The warrant was granted and while serving the warrant at Luster’s home, Henderson also served Luster with three criminal complaints charging him with making a false claim for a license, hunting a deer in the presence of bait, and attempting to hunt a deer in the presence of bait.
On Jan. 10, 2025, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the charge of making a false claim for a license, which was based on the erroneous assumption Luster didn’t own the CWD Research property. Luster then filed a motion to suppress evidence obtained in support of the other two charges, arguing the search warrants were based on false allegations.
On March 18, 2025, prosecutors Iowa moved to dismiss the remaining two charges, telling a judge that DNR “is refusing to disclose the identity of a material witness, despite multiple requests from the Henry County Attorney’s Office to do so.”
Court filings in the criminal case include images from Luster’s trail camera that show “a buck muffin” — a deer-nutrition product derived from ethanol grains — was on the property in July 2024. Attorneys for Luster told the court that by September 2024 the “buck muffin had been removed from the property” — a full month before Luster killed the deer in question.
Between the time the charges were levied against Luster and their eventual dismissal, Luster’s “life and career were turned upside down,” the lawsuit claims.
“In the professional hunting community, one’s reputation is paramount to financial success, and allegations that a person unlawfully hunted with bait provide a significant stain on a professional hunter’s reputation,” the lawsuit alleges. “Luster has suffered significant reputational harm, which has led to his loss of speaking appearances on hunting podcasts, derogation by those that comment on hunting matters, and a loss of business for Luster as a professional land manager and designer of hunting grounds.”
As for why Henderson would have included false or misleading information in his warrant applications, the lawsuit posits that Luster’s success as a hunter has led to “animosity from other hunters and the DNR, including its officers, like Officer Henderson.”
It goes on to argue that “Henderson believed that if he were to obtain evidence pursuant to the search warrant he could then pursue misdemeanor charges against Luster for hunting violations, and with a conviction on those charges, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources could revoke Luster’s hunting license… Luster is known to the DNR. Luster is a professional hunting consultant and a renowned hunter.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages for unlawful search and malicious prosecution. Henderson has yet to file a response to the lawsuit and did not return a call seeking comment. The DNR is not named as a defendant in the case.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Deer-on-Luster-prorperty-July-2024-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

This story was originally published by The 19th.
On Monday, President Donald Trump signed the bipartisan Take It Down Act, which criminalizes the distribution of nonconsensual intimate imagery, including so-called “revenge porn” and deepfakes generated by artificial intelligence.
In addition to creating federal-level criminal consequences, the new law requires online platforms to implement a request-and-removal system where victims of image-based sexual abuse can have their pictures taken down within 48 hours.
The House and Senate sent the measure to the president’s desk with nearly unanimous approval.
US bill with backing from SC legislator heads to president’s desk

Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, championed the bill after one of his teenage constituents was victimized by nonconsensual deepfakes.
It has been the main legislation that first lady Melania Trump has weighed in on since her husband returned to office. Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Republican Rep. María Elvira Salazar of Florida and Democratic Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania led the bipartisan push for the bill.
Teenage activists Elliston Berry and Francesca Mani, both victims of nonconsensual deepfakes, appeared at a roundtable hosted by the first lady to advocate for the bill on March 3.
With the Take It Down Act now law, The 19th explains how it will be implemented and how to request the takedown of explicit images created or shared without permission.
When does the Take it Down Act go into effect?
The criminal provisions of the law will go into effect immediately.
Online platforms have one year from the signing of the bill to create a process that facilitates the removal of nonconsensual intimate images.
What kind of images are covered by the Take It Down Act?
The law is meant to narrowly cover sexually explicit images that have either been shared without the subject’s consent or images that have been created without the consent of the subject, such as with generative AI or through media manipulation.
The definition of sexually explicit content builds on previous federal code, and includes “the uncovered genitals, pubic area, anus or post-pubescent female nipple of an identifiable individual;” the “display or transfer of bodily sexual fluids;” graphic sexual intercourse; bestiality; masturbation; sadistic or masochistic abuse; and “graphic or simulated lascivious exhibition” of anuses, genitals or the pubic area.
Synthetic images — or “digital forgeries” as the bill labels them — must be of “indistinguishable from an authentic visual depiction” of an identifiable individual.
The definition is tailored to not apply to all digital forgeries, even ones that might seem explicit on the surface. For instance, advocates have pointed out that the viral fake video of Trump licking Elon Musk’s feet wouldn’t necessarily qualify for removal or prosecution under the Take It Down Act.
How can I get images removed in the meantime? 
The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, a nonprofit fighting online abuse, operates a free 24/7 hotline to assist victims of image-based sexual abuse at 1-844-878-2274.
Their Safety Center also maintains a list of experienced attorneys and individual state laws.
Distributing intimate images without consent isn’t just a crime, it’s a threat to democracy

As of May 2025, all states and the District of Columbia have some form of law banning image-based sexual abuse, though there are significant variances in the circumstances and types of media covered.
The first step is to make sure you are physically safe, as image-based sexual abuse is frequently an escalation of intimate partner violence. Help is available through the National Domestic Violence Hotline online or through their free 24/7 phone line at 1-800-799-7233.
CCRI recommends documenting evidence of abuse, including screenshots or PDFs of online search results or websites. They suggest keeping both digital and physical copies (printouts, for example) of evidence, and saving other relevant documents like text messages or emails.
Omny Miranda Martone, the founder and CEO of the Sexual Violence Prevention Association, recommends taking screenshots with URLs, the username of the poster, the date and the time the nonconsensual content was shared. Documentation is critical, they said, for pursuing criminal or civil action.
Make sure to only collect documentation of digital sexual violence that depicts you or someone who has authorized collection on their behalf explicitly in writing, Martone said. They also suggest storing evidence in a secure cloud folder or encrypted drive.
Major websites and image-hosting platforms have ways to request image takedowns for emergencies such as these. CCRI has a short list of contacts for major search engines, social media platforms, dating services and pornography sites.
If images you took of yourself have been posted without your consent, filing a copyright claim is another option. Without My Consent, now part of CCRI, has a resource all about filing Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown requests.
“No one should have to go through this alone,” Martone said, recommending that victims reach out to a victims’ right attorney or advocacy organization for help navigating processes safely and confidentially. In a rapidly changing legal landscape, “talking to a professional will ensure you receive up to date information and guidance.”
What if the images are of a minor?  
Explicit images of minors are treated differently, as real images are child sexual abuse material — formally known in most legal code as child pornography — and carry severe penalties.
There are specific, dedicated resources to assist victims of child sexual abuse material.
The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which is authorized and funded by Congress, maintains a CyberTipline to report incidents of child exploitation. Anyone can report to the tipline, and the organization also maintains a 24/7 hotline at 1-800-843-5678.
Take It Down, an initiative from NCMEC that is unaffiliated with the bill of the same name, provides services to anyone who needs assistance removing child sexual abuse material of themselves from the internet.
What might prevent the Take It Down Act from being implemented?
It’s not unlikely that the law could be challenged in court on grounds that it infringes on the First Amendment. Digital rights groups have criticized the request-and-removal provision of the bill, calling it overbroad and a threat to free speech.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a tech policy think tank, argues that the takedown provision could apply to consensual sexual images as well.
It is one of several groups that have highlighted how the request-and-removal process could be ripe for abuse, especially given that the 48-hour timeline may not provide covered platforms with enough time to verify that the content is nonconsensual.
The Center for Democracy and Technology sent a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, urging members to amend the bill to explicitly exclude encrypted services, fearing that platforms will need access to private messages in order to comply with the takedown requests.
Trump’s assertion that he would use the Take It Down Act for himself — “nobody is treated worse online than I am, nobody” he said during his address to the joint session of Congress in March — made activists worry that the bill could be used to remove critical political speech, especially in the context of a wider crackdown by the current administration.
There may also be some issues with enforcing the request-and-removal requirement, which falls to the Federal Trade Commission. An executive order threatens the independence of the agency, and Trump fired the two Democratic Commissioners without cause, which the Supreme Court has previously ruled the president cannot do.
What else should victims know?
Martone also shared some words for anyone being targeted with image-based sexual abuse.
“Please know you are not alone, and this is not your fault,” Martone said. “What’s happening to you is a violation — it’s digital sexual violence — and you deserve justice, safety and support.”
Martone speaks from experience as a survivor of sexual violence, including deepfake abuse. They have been instrumental in advocating for the Take It Down Act and related laws.
“There is hope. Your voice matters,” Martone said. “You are not powerless — and together, we will make sure our laws catch up to protect you.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/guffey-at-White-House-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

Meanwhile, the person who filed the complaint that gave rise to the prosecution — veteran campaign finance watchdog Bob Hall — is criticizing the settlement of the matter as “pitiful.”
The case stems from the political controversy that surrounded the removal of the so-called “Silent Sam” statute from the campus of UNC-Chapel Hill in 2018, and the subsequent back-and-forth that took place between UNC officials, state lawmakers, and private groups that sought to preserve and take control of the statue after it was torn down during a campus protest.
In January of 2020, Hall filed a lengthy and detailed complaint with the Board of Elections in which he provided evidence that the North Carolina Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, along with individual leaders of the group and affiliated organizations were involved in illegally financing the NC Heritage PAC. That PAC, in turn, donated thousands of dollars to an array of Republican officeholders and candidates.
Last Friday’s notice reported that “NC Heritage PAC Treasurer Mitchell Flinchum and NC Heritage PAC Assistant Treasurer Thomas Smith each pled guilty to one misdemeanor count of accepting monetary (cash) contributions in excess of $50 in violation of N.C.G.S. § 163-278.14(b). Both defendants were also ordered to pay the costs of court and a $100 fine.” The notice stated that it was notified of the plea arrangements by the Wake County District Attorney’s office in January and that the complaint that gave rise to the investigation is now closed.
  Bob Hall (File photo)
In a news release publicizing the closure of the case and the convictions, Hall lamented the size and scope of the penalties. “It’s a pitiful settlement, but at least they admitted to engaging in criminal activity,” said Hall, who had asked for dissolution of the PAC and the disgorgement of tens of thousands of dollars of PAC contributions that benefited Republican politicians.
Hall directed criticism at Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman for the modest nature of the punishment meted out.
“It’s disappointing that the District Attorney took so long to accomplish so little,” Hall said. “The way large amounts of cash moved in and out of SCV-related operations is highly suspicious and likely violated tax and anti-corruption laws in addition to a felony statute against filing false campaign finance reports.”
The original complaint identified $28,500 in contributions to several GOP politicians — including Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler and Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger — that Hall argued were unlawful and should have been redirected to the state Civil Penalty and Forfeiture Fund.
Hall’s statement also quoted a pair of dissident Sons of Confederate Veterans members as being critical of the outcome.
Robert “Smitty” Smith, a SCV member who helped the State Board of Elections document the illegal contributions, said, “The fine is basically nothing – it’s like there’s no consequences for all they [SCV leaders] did.”
“It’s crazy that it took so long and they get away,” said Chadwick Rogers, another SCV member who witnessed the illegal activity by SCV leaders that others labeled “money laundering.” Rogers said the punishment should have included SCV losing its charity status.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/justice-scales-gavel_GettyImages-1024x673.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

(Photo of state Senate Chamber/New Hampshire Bulletin file)The New Hampshire Senate is set to vote Thursday on a bill to require that schools maintain a supply of epinephrine, which is used to treat allergic reactions.
House Bill 677 requires New Hampshire schools to have epinephrine injectors, commonly known by the brand name EpiPen, or nasal epinephrine spray, and it requires that a nurse or at least one “assistive personnel” be on site to administer the epinephrine at the school during school hours. The bill gives nurses and school staff five days to replace the epinephrine after it’s used.
Rep. Mike Drago, the Raymond Republican who sponsored the bill, said there are at least two programs that offer epinephrine to schools for free. Epinephrine manufacturers Viatris and ARS Pharmaceuticals both advertise such programs on their websites. Lawmakers plan to rely on these programs to make this proposal possible.
“In reality, we’re putting EpiPens in every single school at no cost,” Drago, who has a child with a nut allergy, said in an April Senate hearing. “And potentially saving lives.”
Under state law, schools are allowed to maintain a supply of and use epinephrine. This bill, if enacted, would require them to do so.
The House previously approved the legislation in an April voice vote, and it received the unanimous recommendation of the Senate Education Committee earlier this month. The bill is co-sponsored by a group of mostly Republicans but has bipartisan support.
Some lawmakers expressed concerns about creating a mandate without establishing a funding source in the budget and relying on outside programs to provide the epinephrine for free.
Sen. Debra Altschiller, a Stratham Democrat, commended Drago at the April hearing for raising the issue, but said she’s concerned “the state would rely on a program that’s at the discretion of a pharmaceutical company.”
“It exists today,” Altschiller said. “It might not exist tomorrow. And to require a specific product be carried in the school at the expense of the school is where I have significant problems.”
She noted epinephrine is “wildly expensive” and called this an “unfunded mandate.”
Drago said he doubts these programs will ever disappear.
Still, to address these concerns, the Senate Education Committee proposed an amendment that establishes a state fund to help schools pay for epinephrine. Though it doesn’t appropriate any money to that fund, the amendment creates a mechanism for the state to accept gifts from organizations besides the pharmaceutical companies.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_3610-1024x633.jpg,,,2025-05-20 13:18:42.636018

Andrew Tauber-Herring was determined to prove that he could go to college, despite several learning disabilities. With extraordinary effort and a unique overseas program that aligned with his passion for Japan, he is now on the path to becoming the first in his family to earn a college degree.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Despite facing multiple learni[...]","Andrew Tauber-Herring grew up in a multi-generational home in Congers, New York, with his sister, parents, grandparents, great-grandmother and great-grandfather—a Holocaust survivor who came to America from Poland and taught himself English at the public library. Now, Andrew has also crossed an ocean and immersed himself in a very different culture in pursuit of opportunity. In January, he moved to Japan, where he’s studying business administration and marketing at a Tokyo-based extension of Lakeland University in Wisconsin.“I absolutely love it, from the challenging courses that I have access to, plus the affordability of tuition. It’s been a very interesting experience,” says Andrew.He says he developed an interest in Japan at 8 years old, when his second-grade class studied different cultures in school. “Ever since I first started reading about the culture and the country, Japan is where my heart always wanted to be. That interest just stayed with me.”His strong interest in all things Japanese was a bright spot for Andrew, whose educational experience was influenced by significant challenges from an early age. While it took him years to receive accurate diagnoses, he now knows, at age 30, that he struggles with several disabilities, including autism, ADHD, dyslexia, “and several others I can’t spell,” he says. While his family, especially his mother, always told him he could do whatever he put his mind to, others weren’t quite as supportive when he was going through school. “I was told back in high school that my learning disabilities would make it very difficult for me to go to college. It was hard for me to hear. From an early age, I knew I wanted to go to college. I had many career ideas, but my teachers made me feel nothing would ever come of it. Anytime I would express interest, they told me things like ‘you shouldn’t count on being accepted.’ I wanted to prove them all wrong.”And he has. Having taken preparatory coursework at Community College of Vermont (CCV) and Champlain College, Andrew is set to earn his bachelor’s degree from Lakeland in the summer of 2027. He will be the first in his family to graduate from college. After graduating from high school in 2013, Andrew got a rough start to college, with a California-based art-school program focused on game design. When that program didn’t pan out and he moved back east—settling in central Vermont in 2016—he was advised to restart with a more traditional college program at the Community College of Vermont. Andrew credits one of his CCV professors, Ritalea Sweeny, for getting him interested in the marketing field. After connecting with the program at Lakeland that helped him achieve his first dream—living in Japan—he now hopes completing his college degree will help him achieve his second goal: working in marketing and advertising. Between college programs, Andrew held various retail and brand-ambassador jobs, worked in event and bank security, and did some manufacturing work. “I’ve done a little bit of everything,” he says. “But I decided to finish school because I realized that without a college degree, I would always stay in a low-income job.” He knew finishing college would likely improve his financial situation, but he also faced more than the usual number of challenges for an adult student looking to go back to school. Andrew says his biggest barrier was a fear of not being able to find a good work-life balance, between working part-time to cover expenses, being a full-time student, and being a student with several learning disabilities, which means he needs more time to study and absorb the material. “In terms of my needs, I’m still figuring it all out, to be honest,” he says. “A smaller classroom helps, and I need flexibility when it comes to due dates.” To help cover costs and make that balance easier, Andrew turned to Hireability Vermont (formerly known as Voc Rehab VT) and VSAC’s Educational Opportunity Center, which works with adult students seeking education and training. “It was amazing working with my VSAC counselor, Karen McGovern,” says Andrew. “She’s done everything she can to help me find additional funding for things I couldn’t afford for my classes. She was also a great support on the emotional side. If I ever felt lost or was struggling, she knew just what to say to help me find my motivation. Things would definitely have been different without VSAC.”Andrew also gives a lot of credit to his partner, Linda. “She has always been there for me and has pushed me when things got hard and I felt like giving up. I also appreciate her family being one of my primary supports in Vermont.” While Andrew says he struggles with writing because of his dyslexia, it’s worth noting that he conducted two interviews for this article entirely over email. And like his grandfather before him, he didn’t hesitate to jump into learning the Japanese language—an intimidating prospect for someone without any difficulties in visual or language processing. “I know a few phrases and words, and I’m learning more every day, the more I observe everyday life. It’s definitely different from English, but when you’re around something 24/7, it’s easy to pick things up,” he says.In terms of finding understanding and accommodation for his learning disabilities in Japan, “It’s honestly a mixed bag,” says Andrew. “In some respects, they are very accommodating with what I need, and other times they don’t really understand. It’s been difficult, but not impossible.” In daily life, however, he finds the Japanese culture to be calm, safe, and accessible, which is a great fit. “The way things are set up in their society, they accommodate me without intention.”Andrew hopes he can stay and work in Japan after he finishes his program. “Taking college classes has broadened my mind to the multitude of possibilities out there for me if I have a degree,” says Andrew. “Now that I’ve landed on marketing, though, I don’t think it will change. I hope one day I can work for a Japanese video game company doing marketing. I love it here. I couldn’t be happier.”  The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-20 16:00:32+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Local government workers’ health plan enters ‘death spiral’,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/20/local-government-workers-health-plan-enters-death-spiral/,Sharp premium increases and waning enrollment have put the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program on a path to the grave.,"Sharp premium increases and waning enrollment have put the local government part of the State Health Benefits Program on a path to the grave. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s health benefits plan for local public workers, harried by years of sharp premium increases and a dwindling subscriber pool, has become “structurally unstable” and “financially unsustainable,” the Treasury said in a report released Tuesday.
The purely informational report is the latest in a series of dire warnings, now outright alarms, over the future of the public worker health plan, which has faced an exodus of municipalities amid repeated double-digit premium hikes approved in recent years.
“The plan’s very high actuarial values, a depleted and now insolvent cash management margin reserve … and a static governance structure have created a self-reinforcing loop of premium increases and employer exits — what actuaries commonly refer to as a ‘death spiral,’” the report says.
Health insurance plans function by diluting risk, using healthy subscribers’ premiums to underwrite medical care for sicker members. But as premiums under the local part of the State Health Benefits Program rose, towns and cities with younger, healthier workers fled to private options.
As a result, risk and premiums continued their climb, and municipalities continued their departures. The number of local governments participating in the plan fell from 768 in 2021 to 689 at the end of March.
In January, only 56.2% of local governments were participating in the program, and the municipalities that return to the plan after facing higher premiums under private options could push costs up further as higher risk workers return to the public pool, driving up overall risk and costs.
Rising prescription drug usage — especially around new and trendy weight-loss drugs — plus the growing use of high-cost services and inflation have contributed to the plan’s rising costs, the report said.
The state’s actuary has said premiums for the local government part of the program would need to rise by 19.5% to stabilize its reserve fund, on top of separate hikes to account for increased prescription and medical benefit usage.
A law signed last November to keep local government workers’ plan solvent by lending from state workers’ plan could bring the floor for premium increases up even higher. The local part of the State Health Benefits Program owes state workers’ plan roughly $120 million, and it won’t have the money to repay that debt without a mid-year premium hike. By law, those loans must be repaid within 365 days of being taken.
“There could be a 26.5 percent ‘floor’ to 2026 premium increases … in addition to the ‘regular’ medical and prescription drug trend rates,” says the report, adding increases to rebuild the plan’s reserves could be phased in over multiple years.
Cumulative increases from 2026 through 2029 are expected to “significantly exceed” 60%, according to the report. Those would add to the 59% cumulative increase it saw between 2022 and 2025.
“Without meaningful intervention, current trends in enrollment, utilization, and health care cost inflation will continue to drive unsustainable premium increases,” the report says. “The situation is not one of temporary imbalance — it reflects deep-seated structural challenges that, if unaddressed, will further destabilize the plan.”
The high rates at which the plans cover medical expenses have also contributed to their price. Nearly all, 95%, of local government workers enrolled in the program are on plans with actuarial values of 97%, meaning workers are responsible for paying just 3% of their health care expenses through copays, deductibles, or coinsurance.
The School Employees Health Benefits Plan faces similar distress, the report says.
That program, which offers health benefits to school board employees, has escaped most of the large premium hikes faced that hit local government workers — between 2022 and 2025, their premiums rose by 44% — and saw some temporary relief from 2020 changes that moved most of its enrollees to more cost-effective plans.
But that plan is facing price pressures for the same reasons as the State Health Benefits Program, and the 2020 changes bar the committee tasked with oversight from tweaking benefits or plan rules in response to rising costs until 2028.
“The SEHBP now faces significant financial and actuarial risks and may be on a similar trajectory as SHBP-LG — potentially entering a death spiral in the medium-term or experiencing serious affordability issues for its members,” the report says.
Because state workers cannot leave their public health plan, the state part of the State Health Benefits Program remains stable, but it will still require premium increases to meet rising costs, the report says.
Plan design changes could partly defray rising costs but “even the most aggressive plan design changes will likely not be enough to reverse the systemic unraveling now underway” and broader changes are needed to stabilize the public health benefit programs, the report said.
Those changes could include a lower actuarial values — meaning enrollees would pay a greater share of their medical costs — as well as waiting periods for municipalities to reenroll in the State Health Benefits Program after leaving and more rule-setting authority for the Treasury.
“Failure to reform will lead to ongoing price increases and employer exits, and eventually a complete and disorderly collapse of the plan,” the report says.
Alternatively, the state could unwind the local part of the program and leave local governments to find health coverage through group insurance funds while the plan phases out.
“Phasing out the plan in an orderly, supported, and equitable manner will mitigate further destabilization and align the State’s policy approach with prevailing market conditions and local preferences,” the report says.

The goal is to deter drivers from passing them at pickup and drop-off stops.
New Haven has more than 300 school buses that drive 17,000 kids every day.
Mayor Justin Elicker, who has two young daughters, said he’s seen close calls with drivers and students trying to get on or off the bus.
“People are either not paying attention or they’re just deciding to drive right on through,” Elicker said. “And that is putting our children at risk in the city.”
If the Board of Alders passes the bill, passing the bus could result in a $250 fine.
“Drivers that run through these stop signs will receive a $250 ticket,” Elicker explained. “They will have 30 days to appeal that ticket. The footage will be reviewed by a city representative and another individual to make sure that we are properly levying these fines on people.”
The money collected will go toward roadway safety improvements. Elicker said that as long as the legislation passes, they aim to have the cameras installed by fall.
The proposal was celebrated by city and school officials, as well as by a first student driver and driver trainer.
“A lot of cars or drivers want to try to beat buses, which obviously leaves our kids in dangerous situations,” Richard Johnson said. “So this act is definitely something that we look forward to.”
Connecticut didn’t allow cameras on the outside of school buses until 2024. Bridgeport was one of the first cities to install them. As of February, they had ticketed more than 10,000 drivers.

“It has been a privilege to serve on the Court of Appeals,” Bogardus said in a statement. “I began my legal career on the court as a law clerk and it is an honor to be able to end my career here as a judge. I have especially enjoyed working with my law clerks and my fellow judges, and have learned so much during my tenure as a judge.”
Prior to attending University of New Mexico School of Law, where she received her law degree in 1991, Bogardus worked as a medical technologist. At UNM, she served as an editor for the school’s policy-oriented Natural Resources Journal. Following law school, she clerked for the late Judge Pamela Minzner, during the latter’s time on the Court of Appeals, before going into private practice. As a judge, Bogardus chaired the Rules of Civil Procedure Committee and served on the New Mexico Civil Law Commission.
In a statement, Court of Appeals Chief Judge Jacqueline Medina described Bogardus as “a respected and hard-working judge,” who will be “missed by her colleagues and court staff.”
Bogardus will retire on June 7; the Judicial Nominating Commission will interview applicants on June 17 for the position on the Court of Appeals, which has approximately 800 cases per year. As described in a news release, the court hears appeals of all cases, except:

Let […]","Attorney Ven Johnson stands in front of the Midland County Courthouse for a press conference marking the five year anniversary of the Edenville Dam failure on May 19, 2025. | ScreenshotMarking the five year anniversary of the 2020 Edenville Dam failure, a host of residents whose homes were damaged by the dam’s collapse gathered outside the Midland County Courthouse Monday, calling for the state to step up and make things right with those impacted by the flood. 
“Not a single dime has been collected. Let me repeat that, not a single dime has been collected by these folks behind me, the true victims and survivors, nor on behalf of their attorneys. Not a single dime has been offered by the state of Michigan to step up to do the right thing,” attorney Ven Johnson told reporters, arguing the state’s response to residents seeking accountability through the courts had been to “defend, delay, deny.” 
Johnson recounted the past 5 years of legal proceedings, as residents impacted by the flooding seek damages from the Department of Environment Great Lakes and Energy and the Department of Natural Resources, alleging the state knew the dam was not safe for continued operations, but still authorized the dam operator, Boyce Hydro, to raise the water levels within the lake created by the dam.

The state attributes the dam’s failure to “historic levels of rainfall.” More than 11,000 people and 2,500 structures were damaged due to flooding, with the state’s initial estimate for damages coming out to $250 million. 
While a federal judge later found Boyce Hydro responsible for the dam’s failure, ordering the dam’s former owner Lee Mueller to pay $119 million in environmental damage, Johnson argued the state had yet to properly respond to the complaint filed by residents shortly after the dam collapsed. 
He pointed to an order filed by Court of Claims Judge Douglas Shapiro in October 2023, which notes “this case was filed over three years ago and that no Answer has ever been filed and that no discovery has yet occurred.” Shapiro called the state’s repeated requests to reverse a previous order, which partly denied the state’s effort to resolve the case without bringing it to trial, “time-consuming and unsuccessful.” 
While Court of Claims Judge James Robert Redford last week denied another request to resolve the case in favor of the state without going to trial, Johnson predicted the state would appeal the decision, noting that the government retains an automatic right of appeal. Johnson said he would be objecting to that request, as would the attorneys standing beside him at the conference. 
“Sadly, this is a months, plural, long process,” he said.
Johnson repeatedly compared the state’s legal approach to the way it handled legal proceedings in the Flint Water Crisis where the state was ordered to pay $600 million to Flint residents and property owners whose water was contaminated.
“There’s your blueprint for how the state of Michigan deals with infrastructure failure. No one went to jail, no one was prosecuted, and it was the Civil lawyers who did what they did and exactly what we’re doing in this case to try to bring some semblance of justice,” Johnson said. “That took them eight and a half years before the State of Michigan stepped up and began to take responsibility and pay for the damage….But even so, that litigation, in many respects, is ongoing even today.”
While the state pursued several state officials, including Republican former Gov. Rick Snyder for their role and response in the Flint water crisis, the efforts failed to return any convictions after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in 2022 the charges were invalid. 
The residents pursuing the state for the dam collapse are scheduled to go to trial in January 2026, Johnson said. However, if the case is allowed to proceed, he expects the state will take the case all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court. 
In the meantime, Mike and Lisa Callan, whose home was destroyed by the flooding, said the burden is getting greater and greater each year. 
“We have a couple mortgages we’re still paying on this property. And, you know, now, now we have a water assessment coming. You know, my water assessment is about $48,000 for a piece of property that has absolutely, you know, nothing there,” Mike Callan said. 
Carl Hamman, a member of the Sanford Village Council, warned that residents could lose their homes over the assessment fees the state is requiring to rebuild the Edenville, as well as the Sanford Dam, which was located downstream.
“If they’re living on —and I’m on Social Security — If you’re living only on Social Security, I can’t afford another $5,000 a year tax. Can’t do it. I’ll have to walk away from the place that I’ve been at for 35 years,” Hamman said.
Kevin Carlson, another attorney working on residents’ behalf, said the dam failure was not just a natural disaster but a failure of government and a breach of trust.

“What the state officials knew here, by January of 2020 at the very latest, was that the Edenville Dam did not meet the minimum safety requirements for a dam to continue operating in the state of Michigan…. The people behind me, the people that live downstream from this dam, they didn’t know that,” Carlson said.
“They couldn’t take matters into their own hands and start evacuating early. They count on the state acting behind closed doors to know that when a dam is unsafe for continued operation, there’s one thing you shouldn’t do to it: load up the lake behind it with more water. That’s what the state authorized the dam operator to do.”
Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Attorney General, which is representing EGLE and the DNR, said the failure of the dam was tragic, but noted it was not a state-owned dam and that survivors of the flood had already sued the dam owner and forced liquidation of their assets. 
“Despite the claims of plaintiffs’ attorney Johnson today, the litigation still pending in the Court of Claims is nothing like the Flint water litigation, and there is no appeal pending in it,” Wimmer said.
“Plaintiffs in this litigation already lost their lawsuit against the county governments because they did not have evidence to back up their allegations.  We expect the same thing will happen in the Court of Claims. The plaintiffs do not have the evidence to support their allegations. Instead, the evidence confirms that the state agencies are not responsible for the dam’s failure,” Wimmer said, before noting the department’s sympathies lie with those affected by the dam failures.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Colleagues of North Dakota Rep. Cindy Schreiber-Beck are remembering her as a stalwart advocate for education, aviation and agricultural issues.
Schreiber-Beck, R-Wahpeton, died Sunday at age 70. She was first elected to the North Dakota Legislature in 2014 and served as vice chair of the House Education Committee during the legislative session that adjourned earlier this month.
Schreiber-Beck’s expertise on K-12 education, higher education, aeronautics and agricultural issues was unparalleled, said her seatmate, Rep. Alisa Mitskog, D-Wahpeton. 
“She truly represented her constituents, set aside partisan politics and she really went to work for the people she represented,” Mitskog said Tuesday.
In a statement, State Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said Schreiber-Beck was a trusted legislative adviser, confidant and K-12 education advocate.
“Rep. Schreiber-Beck was tireless in her work to produce better education policy, and she had the welfare of students and their families foremost in her mind,” Baesler said.
Schreiber-Beck volunteered as executive director for the North Dakota Agricultural Aviation Association for nearly 40 years. She and her late husband, Gerry Beck, operated Tri-State Aviation in Wahpeton.
In March, Schreiber-Beck was inducted into North Dakota’s Aviation Hall of Fame by the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission for her significant contributions. She served for 25 years on the North Dakota Aeronautics Commission and was a member of a governor’s task force that established North Dakota’s Unmanned Aerial Systems test site.
In a statement, Gov. Kelly Armstong said she embodied the truest essence of public service, volunteerism and giving back to the community.
“Cindy Schreiber-Beck served the citizens of North Dakota with a quiet strength and determination that touched so many facets of life, from agriculture and aviation to education and community development, and it was an honor to call her a friend,” Armstrong said.
Armstrong directed all U.S. and North Dakota flags to be flown at half-staff from dawn to dusk on the day of Schreiber-Beck’s interment. 
Funeral services for Schreiber-Beck will be held at 4 p.m. May 28 at the Fargo Air Museum.
The District 25 Republican Party executive committee will appoint a successor to complete her term, which runs through 2026.
Mitskog said she’ll remember fondly that Schreiber-Beck had a bit of a sweet tooth.
“I’ll never walk past a bowl of candy without thinking of her. She loved candy … and I think that kind of helped drive her energy,” she said.

Found in people and animals worldwide, they are linked to cancer and other health effects.","In summary
California has no health standards for these chemicals in fish, so activists are urging action. Found in people and animals worldwide, they are linked to cancer and other health effects.



Contaminants known as “forever chemicals” have been discovered in San Francisco Bay fish at levels that could pose a health threat to people who eat fish caught there, according to new research published today.
Linked to an array of health conditions such as cancers, heart disease and pregnancy disorders, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances resist breaking down in the environment. Used by industries to make waterproof coatings, firefighting foams, food packaging and more, these chemicals have contaminated people and animals everywhere around the globe, including newborns.
Researchers from the San Francisco Estuary Institute found the chemicals in striped bass, largemouth bass, leopard shark, white croaker, white sturgeon and other fish collected between 2009 and 2019 throughout San Francisco Bay. 
Recreational and subsistence anglers catch striped bass and the other fish from boats, shores or piers, but they are not sold commercially. Many Asian immigrants, other people of color and low-income people fish in the bay to feed their families.
California has set health advisories for other contaminants in fish, but not for these “forever chemicals.” Based on Massachusetts’ advisory — the most stringent in the country — 83% of the fish tested are considered unsafe to eat daily, and a third of the fish would not be safe to eat even in amounts of half a pound a week, the researchers said.
The chemicals seep into soil and wash into waterways that flow into the bay from landfills, airports, industrial sites, military bases and sewage treatment plants. 
 “All along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay, especially along the Carquinez, we see how many polluting industries are there. Yet people still fish there and, because of finances, many people eat that fish,” said LaDonna Williams, a program director with the Bay Area-based environmental justice nonprofit All Positives Possible. “Do you just close your eyes and pray over your food? … That’s a heck of a decision to have to make.”
The findings, published in the scientific journal ES&T Water, build upon earlier reports that “forever chemicals” are among the cocktail of contaminants in San Francisco Bay.
The chemicals are likely contaminating ocean fish throughout California, but no statewide studies have been conducted. 
“We know already that (these chemicals) are impacting all of us,” Miguel Méndez, an environmental scientist who was a co-author of the study, said in a press release. “But we also know that there’s a lot of communities in the Bay that fish, and a lot of these communities tend to be underrepresented and more marginalized in the Bay.” 
State officials have already posted signs at San Francisco Bay piers to warn people to limit or avoid consumption of certain fish because of other contaminants, including mercury, a potent neurotoxin that is a legacy of the Gold Rush.
Rebecca Sutton, managing senior scientist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute and an author of the study, said those warnings are likely protective for “forever chemicals,” as well.

But fishing and environmental groups say California needs to set guidelines for what levels of the chemicals are unsafe, which will determine advice for how much people may eat.
Wesley Smith, senior toxicologist with California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, told CalMatters that the agency is developing guidance for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, known as PFOS, although there is no timeline yet.
About 91% of the San Francisco Bay fish samples tested with the most advanced methods contained PFOS, used in some upholstery, carpets, cookware and firefighting foams beginning in the 1940s. It was phased out in the United States in the early 2000s because of potential health effects.
Smith said the other states that took early action may have been concerned about high levels found in some areas. “We’re in a better position to move forward” in California, he said, because of the work by other states and the new analysis released today.
Smith advised people to follow the warning signs and eat smaller and younger fish to reduce their exposure.
Levels of the chemicals in San Francisco Bay fish were similar to those found in marine fish in some other harbors nationwide, but generally lower than freshwater fish caught in rivers, streams and lakes. The researchers tested the fish for 40 of the chemicals — a tiny fraction of this vast class — and found 20 in fish collected in 2009, 2014 and 2019. 
Chris Shutes, executive director of the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance, said in addition to setting advisories for these contaminants, state officials should prevent them from getting into the water in the first place. 
A bill in the Legislature authored by state Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, would phase out the sale of certain products that have some forever chemicals intentionally added, such as ski wax, dental floss, products for children, cookware and food packaging. California has previously banned it in certain fabrics, cosmetics and food packaging. 
“These results also show how critical it is to phase out non-essential uses” and also “improve monitoring and limit how much” gets into waterways, Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group who has investigated the chemicals in freshwater fish, said in an email.
Fish caught in the southern reaches of the bay, from Redwood City to Milpitas and San Jose, were especially contaminated — with more than 80% exceeding Massachusetts’ threshold for one meal per week, compared to 8% in other parts of the bay. 
Tides don’t thoroughly flush out the runoff and treated sewage that carry the chemicals into the southern portion of the bay, home to one of the largest wastewater treatment facilities in the West. 
As old “forever chemicals” are phased out, new ones are still leaching into the environment. The research team found one chemical that has never before been documented in marine fish. 
No one knows how many people eat fish caught in the bay. Though nearly a quarter million anglers from Bay Area counties purchased licenses to fish in California in 2024, no one had tallied all people who fish from shorelines, piers, jetties or breakwaters — and there are no official counts of people whose families would go hungry if they didn’t. 
One 25-year-old survey from the San Francisco Estuary Institute reported that Asian men make up a higher proportion of Bay Area anglers compared to the region’s demographics. Another study, farther upstream, reported Southeast Asians ate the most fish caught in the Delta, followed by African American and Hispanic anglers, who were exposed to much higher levels of mercury than recommended.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/062124-Pier-7-Fishing-LE-CM-16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

(Getty Images)Minnesota authorities would no longer be able to charge people with major drug crimes solely on the basis of the dirty water in their bongs — thanks to a provision in the 192-page judiciary and public safety bill that was sent to Gov. Tim Walz over the weekend. He’s expected to sign it. 
Under current law, quantities of bong water greater than four ounces can be treated like the pure, uncut version of whatever substance the bong was used to smoke. That can lead to massive criminal penalties: 4 ounces of bong water used to consume methamphetamine, for instance, can trigger a first-degree felony charge carrying up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
The new language removes that provision and specifies that for charging purposes, a drug mixture “does not include the fluid used in a water pipe or any amount of a controlled substance that is dissolved in the pipe’s fluid.” The change would apply retroactively to August 2023, bringing it in line with a broader drug paraphernalia decriminalization bill that went into effect at that time.
In practice, prosecutors virtually never charge bong water offenses because most people intuitively understand that 8 ounces of dirty bong water is not the same thing as 8 ounces of pure methamphetamine. 
“Counting dirty bong water as pure drugs is like counting a beer bottle full of backwash and cigarette butts as 80-proof whiskey,” as one attorney colorfully characterized it to the Reformer earlier this year.
But it does happen: The issue drew national attention last year after a northwest Minnesota prosecutor levied first-degree drug charges against a Fargo woman, Jessica Beske, on account of the water allegedly found in her bong.
Because of the retroactive provision, that case would be thrown out if Walz signs the bill.
“The ACLU-MN is glad to see the legislature fixed this loophole that allowed rogue prosecutors to put people suffering from addiction in prison for smoking drugs out of a bong,” said Alicia Granse of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Beske in court. “Ms. Beske and others like her can no longer be subjected to this cruel and unusual treatment.”
Minnesota became the butt of national jokes after the state supreme court ruled in 2009 that bong water could be legally considered a drug. The justices relied, in part, on the testimony of a Minnesota State Patrol officer who claimed that drug users keep bong water “for future use… either drinking it or shooting it in the veins.”

Kasper Juul Eriksen, now 32, left his home in Aalborg, Denmark, as a teenager in 2009 and spent a year in the U.S. as a high school exchange student in Starkville, Mississippi.
He and a local teenager, Savannah Hobart, fell in love. After he returned to Denmark’s fourth-largest city, he and Savannah maintained their relationship for four years, across an ocean and seven time zones.
Kasper immigrated to the U.S. in 2013 and got work as a welder – a job he has held steadily since then. He and Savannah married in 2014 and settled outside Starkville in the tiny town of Sturgis, soon starting a family.
For years, Kasper went through the process of trying to become a U.S. citizen, and Savannah Eriksen – now homeschooling their children and pregnant with their fifth baby, due in August – said her husband’s move toward citizenship appeared to be on track. He received notice last September that his naturalization application was being reviewed, and records from the U.S. government raised no questions about his paperwork, Savannah said.
Kasper and Savannah Eriksen went to Memphis, Tennessee, on April 15 so he could be interviewed about naturalization, and she said they were met by ICE agents.
“Kasper was detained for a paperwork miscommunication from 2015, and I was sent home with no explanation and no idea where my husband had been transported,” Savannah Eriksen said in a statement she released late Monday to Mississippi Today.
Kasper is among an unknown number of immigrants who have been detained since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. Some of the detainees had entered the U.S. without authorization, while others entered with temporary visas or, like Kasper Eriksen, were in the process of becoming naturalized citizens.
Savannah said she and her husband were told in April that his paperwork problem was with an application for removal of conditions on his residency – a form used by an immigrant married to a U.S. citizen.
After Kasper was taken into custody in Memphis, Savannah made the three-hour drive back to Sturgis by herself and “to say I couldn’t control my emotions would be an understatement,” she said.
“The next 24 hours would, without a doubt, (be) the most frightening and stressful I have ever experienced, as I pined for my husband and some kind of communication to confirm his safety and whereabouts,” Savannah said.
She said that before the April appointment, her husband had never been told about any paperwork miscommunication, either through online messages or during interviews in the naturalization process.
She later learned that Kasper was being detained at the LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, Louisiana.
Kasper’s attorneys have filed petitions to seek his release, and they met with him May 15 to review those. A judge will decide whether he will be let out, Savannah said he does not have a court date.
“Kasper is a fully integrated, productive member of society,” Savannah said. She said he has “an impeccable work ethic,” holds a driver’s license and has paid taxes since being employed in the U.S.
“While Kasper embodies all the positive qualities of a hard-working man in pursuit of the American Dream, he never forgets his family and friends,” she said. “He spends time with us and takes the time to give each of his children the attention and fatherly love they deserve.”
She said friends and family in Mississippi and Denmark are supporting the family with “prayers, financial assistance and positive, uplifting attitudes.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20074535/att.ltlp0zjjglX27g8FfO488DMt-TX33IfElNT04XpXvmQ.jpg,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

DemasThe U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear a lawsuit filed by nearly a dozen Michigan Republican lawmakers seeking to roll back voting rights measures passed by voters in 2018 and 2022.
The suit, filed in 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan, argued that because the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, found in Article I, Section 4, provides for state legislatures to regulate the times, places, and manner of holding federal elections, measures passed by citizen-led petition initiatives are unconstitutional as they infringed on the state Legislature’s role within state election law.
The U.S. Supreme Court’s refusal to take the case was the third, and now final, rejection after the lawsuit was initially dismissed by U.S. District Court Judge Jane Beckering, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, in April 2024 for a lack of standing, a decision which was then affirmed by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2024.
The lawsuit was sponsored by Michigan Fair Elections and the Great Lakes Justice Center and named Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater as defendants.

Benson hailed the decision not to take up the case as a “victory for the people of Michigan,” saying the U.S. Supreme Court had correctly upheld the right of Michigan voters to amend the state constitution.
 “In recent years, voters in Michigan have overwhelmingly supported ballot initiatives to create a citizen-led independent redistricting process, to guarantee at least nine days of early voting for every statewide election, and to make voting more accessible for every eligible citizen. Today’s action ensures that the will of the voters will stand on these and other issues important to the people of our state,” Benson said.
Proposal 3 of 2018 and Proposal 2 of 2022 both passed with at least 60% of the vote and guaranteed the rights to same-day voter registration, nine days of early voting, absentee voting, among other rights. After voters approved the constitutional amendments, the Legislature passed legislation implementing the measures.
The suit sought not only to halt the changes brought on by the voter-passed initiatives, but also prohibit the future use altogether of citizen-led petition initiatives when they pertain to state election law.
“We also have procedures in place at the state level to amend election law,” state Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater), one of the 11 lawmakers who filed the suit, said at the time. “However, these processes were violated in 2018 and 2022 when an alternative amendment process was used without regard to federal constitutional requirements. This lawsuit challenges recent attempts to subvert our constitutional process and will protect against such actions in the future.”
The legal argument behind the lawsuit, known as the independent state legislature theory, was mostly rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2023 when it ruled in Moore v Harper. 
In that case’s 6-3 majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that there were limits to state legislative power in such matters, effectively repudiating the claim that only state legislatures had the power to make election rules, thus providing state and federal courts, and by extension, state constitutions, a role in that process.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_8050-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

Hillel at the University of Delaware has launched a $12 million capital campaign to build a new, state-of-the-art Jewish student center, unveiling the ambitious project at a campus event on Sunday that drew students, alumni, university leaders, and community members.
The “Building the Jewish Future” campaign aims to fund a modern facility that will serve as the cornerstone of Jewish life on campus.

The project has already raised $8 million, bolstered by three lead gifts exceeding $1 million from Stuart and Suzanne Grant, the Kristol Family, and the Book Family. A $500,000 challenge match has also been announced to help maintain fundraising momentum.
“This new facility represents a critical investment in Jewish student life at the University of Delaware,” said Donna Schwartz, Executive Director of Hillel at UD. “As engagement in Hillel’s programs continues to grow, we need a center that can accommodate diverse activities, foster meaningful connections, and serve as a beacon of Jewish life on campus. Together, we’re ensuring a vibrant Jewish future at UD.”
Hillel International President and CEO Adam Lehman headlined the kickoff event, which was held at the Trabant University Center. He moderated a panel of current Jewish students who reflected on their campus experiences, particularly in the months following the events of October 7, 2023.
“We know from our work at the University of Delaware and campuses across the country just how important it is for Jewish students to have dedicated, welcoming spaces where they can fully express their identities, engage in Jewish life, and find community,” Lehman said. “This new facility will ensure that Jewish Blue Hens have an amazing place to call home for decades to come.”
The proposed building will replace the existing Kristol Center for Jewish Life and include a large event hall with capacity for 250 people, smaller study and meeting rooms, a rooftop lounge, and a Beit Midrash – a traditional Jewish learning space.
Construction is expected to begin in October 2025, with completion anticipated by the end of 2026.

Ohio state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, introduced a bill last week that would require Ohio State football games to kick off at 3:30 p.m. or later if the Buckeyes are playing a top-10 ranked team in the Associated Press poll.
“A few weeks ago, I said it would be a crime for FOX to put Ohio State vs Texas at noon,” Fischer said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Promises made, promises kept!”

The Ohio State Buckeyes kick off their season against the Texas Longhorns in Columbus on Aug. 30. The time of the game has not been released, but it will air on Fox and is expected to be a noon game.

The game will be a rematch of the Cotton Bowl from earlier this year, which the Buckeyes won 28-14 — eventually going on to win the National Championship by defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.
The Ohio Attorney General would slap a $10 million fine against either the host team’s athletic conference or the television network broadcasting if a game was played starting at noon — “whichever party scheduled the earlier start time,” according to the bill.
Ohio State has played a lot of noon games in recent years on Fox Big Noon Kickoff. The Buckeyes played five Big Noon Kickoff games during their last season. Former Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer joined the Fox Big Noon Kickoff in 2019 for two seasons and returned in 2022 after coaching the Jacksonville Jaguars for a year.
The Ohio State-Michigan game, which is traditionally played at noon, would be an exception, according to the bill.
Ohio Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, is also trying to use legislation to change how Buckeye fans can watch the games. Ohio Senate Bill 94 would ban state universities from entering into or renewing contracts to broadcast a game exclusively on a streaming service.
Ohio State has exclusively streamed some of their football games in recent years on the streaming service Peacock.

Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland) presents legislation to the Judiciary Committee on May 19 that would restrict the scope of immigration-related work of individual law enforcement officers and state employees. (Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)As some communities in Maine have clashed over local police contracting with federal immigration authorities, with varying outcomes, legislators are pushing for new state laws that would make those decisions universal. 
On Monday, dozens of people packed the Maine Legislature’s Judiciary Committee room, spilling into two overflow rooms, to testify largely in support of two bills proposed by Democrats that would restrict local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement. 
For the most part, testimony for and against plans in Augusta mirrored the arguments that have been voiced in board meetings in a coastal community in Southern Maine. In April, the Wells Police Department became the first local agency in Maine to contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under what’s called the 287(g) program, which has divided the community. 
After the 287(g) program was discontinued in 2012 due to the discovery of discriminatory practices such as racial profiling, President Donald Trump revived it to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. 
Wells community divided over ICE agreement with local police

Participation is growing across the country. As of Monday, ICE had signed 588 agreements with agencies in 40 states. Six states have laws or policies that prohibit participation, according to ICE.
Wells remains the only local agency in the program in Maine. Monmouth Winthrop Police Department, a combination of departments that serve central Maine communities, applied for the program but withdrew its application after community pushback.
While immigration is a federal matter by law, work on the local level is key. An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities. 
The effect of both bills, LD 1259 and  LD 1971, would be to prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities.
LD 1259 would do so by explicitly prohibiting contracts with such authorities, while LD 1971 would place restrictions on enforcement activities absent such formal agreements, which is the case for the majority of police departments in Maine that currently have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A fine point was placed on that subjectivity when Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) questioned Kennebec County Sheriff Ken Mason, who testified against both bills on behalf of the Maine Sheriffs Association’s Legislative Policy Committee, about general police protocols for when to involve federal agents, in light of a routine traffic stop in Waldo County leading to two immigration detentions. 
“At what point in that dichotomy of events is the decision made to contact Border Patrol and why?” Talbot Ross asked.
Mason responded, “I have to rely on my deputies and the supervisors that are working the road that day to make a judgment call on if they believe they need to call somebody.” 
Proposals 
The text of LD 1259 is succinct. Sponsored by Rep. Ambureen Rana (D-Bangor), the legislation would prohibit state or local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities. 
LD 1971, sponsored by Rep. Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland), would restrict the scope of immigration-related work of individual law enforcement officers and state employees regardless of federal contracts. 
Specifically, LD 1971 would prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from “stopping, investigating, interrogating, arresting or detaining” a person for immigration enforcement purposes. This would include in response to a hold request, immigration detainer or administrative warrant issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
It would also prevent law enforcement from holding someone solely for immigration enforcement purposes for longer than 48 hours and establish clear protocols during custody, including requiring law enforcement to inform incarcerated people of their rights before an interview by an immigration authority. 
The bill specifies that it would not prohibit a law enforcement agency from arresting, detaining or performing other law enforcement duties due to reasons not solely based on the person’s immigration status. 










Home rule is wonderful until it comes to our constitutional rights, which our federal authorities are violating right now.


– Rep. Ambureen Rana


Other than law enforcement, LD 1971 would prohibit state employees from inquiring into immigration status unless the inquiry is required by law or necessary to provide the service sought by the resident.
Proponents say that allowing local police to carry out federal immigration enforcement would erode public trust and safety.
Lisa Parisio, policy director at the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only state-wide immigration legal services organization, said ILAP’s clients have already reported that they’ve decided to not call the police when they wanted to out of fear for their own safety and that they are scared to continue serving as a witness in court. 
Some of their clients have also reported that they’re not pursuing higher education out of fear of immigration enforcement, which Parisio described as a loss to Maine’s future economy. 
Many who testified focused on cost. Proponents said the bills would protect local tax dollars from being strained to carry out federal responsibilities.
Under 287(g) agreements, ICE is responsible for the cost of training and information technology infrastructure, however the local law enforcement agency bears all other costs, including personnel expenses such as salary and overtime, benefits and lawsuits, according to the general memorandum of understanding. 
Rep. Elizabeth Caruso (R-Caratunk) said she appreciated this local control argument but asked Rana, in that spirit, why not leave the decision of whether to contract with federal immigration authorities up to local communities? 
“I believe that we shouldn’t be tying the hands of our local law enforcement by allowing the federal government to pressure them into these agreements,” Rana responded. “Home rule is wonderful until it comes to our constitutional rights, which our federal authorities are violating right now.”
Many proponents also highlighted this latter point, that they do not want local police to be implicated with a federal agency that has been accused of disregarding due process.
Immigration detention increase reveals expanded federal operations in Maine

Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen, who testified against both bills on behalf of the Maine Chiefs of Police Association, said he reviewed information about the 287(g) program and decided against his department participating. However, he does not think the blanket ban on such agreements in Rana’s bill is the right approach, nor the restrictions on cooperating with federal authorities for immigration matters in the other bill.
“It disrupts long standing partnerships among local, state and federal agencies and will prevent local law enforcement from exercising discretion in critical situations,” Moen said.  
Moen and Mason from the Maine Sheriffs Association were the only two people to testify against the bills on Monday. Other groups submitted testimony in opposition, including the Maine County Commissioners Association to LD 1259. 
The association’s legislative policy committee co-chairs, Stephen Gordon and Jean-Marie Caterina, wrote that the legislation could put at risk federal funding that county jails receive to detain people accused of violating federal law.
“These funds help defray county jail operating costs, which is good for local property taxpayers who are asked to fund the great bulk of the cost of operating county jails,” they wrote.  
As Maine has seen an uptick in immigration detentions, some immigrants rights advocates have raised concern about the financial incentives prisons and jails have to assist with the Trump administration’s goal of expanding space for immigration detention. 
The Democratic proposals come after Republicans presented a conflicting bill last month that would prevent local agencies from adopting any policies that restrict them from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration law. 
None of these bills have received committee votes yet and there is only a month left until lawmakers are expected to conclude their work for the first year of Maine’s two-year Legislative session. Rana told Maine Morning Star that the intention is for the Legislature to make its decisions on the topic this year.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The Kansas Prisoner Review Board responded to a backlash of criticism by rescinding a decision to authorize parole for a Winfield Correctional Facility inmate sentenced to life in prison in the shooting death of a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper.
The Kansas Department of Corrections issued a statement confirming the state review board, which had approved release of Jimmie Nelms in March, met May 16 and voted to reverse an order providing for Nelms’ conditional release.
Corrections spokesperson David Thompson said the board “rescinded its previous decision to grant parole and decided to deny him release at this time.”
In May 1978, Nelms shot KHP Trooper Conroy O’Brien, 26, during a traffic stop on the Kansas Turnpike near Matfield Green. Nelms was captured after a shootout with another KHP trooper.
Nelms, 78, was convicted of premeditated felony murder and sentenced to two life terms in prison, but became eligible for parole in 1993. He appeared before the state’s parole board nine times, Thompson said.
The original decision by review board members Carolyn Perez, Jeannie Wark and Mark Keating was sharply criticized by KHP Col. Erik Smith, Attorney General Kris Kobach and Kansas State Troopers Association president Sage Hill.
Smith, who said KHP consistently opposed Nelms’ release, said the state’s legal framework allowing parole of someone sentenced to life behind bars was flawed. He said there was “no conceivable world in which the release of a convicted cop killer – an executioner – is acceptable.”
Hill said the original decision to parole Nelms was “disgraceful and disgusting,” and review board members should feel “profound shame” for deciding Nelms ought to be freed.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kansas-law-enforcement-memorial-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 11:05:08.790804

Glenn Youngkin speaks with members of the media in Virginia's Capitol on Jan. 13, 2025.  (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods /Virginia Mercury)Gov. Glenn Youngkin directed state leaders to develop resources to track incidents of antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry at Virginia’s schools through an executive order announced Monday evening. 
Executive Order 48 expands on his administration’s efforts and work by the legislature to combat prejudice against Jewish students at all levels of Virginia’s education system. 
According to the executive order, surveys conducted by the Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM), a commission established by the governor in 2022, found 554 recorded antisemitism incidents in Virginia over the past year, with most of them occurring in Virginia’s schools.
“No one should be unsafe in the classroom or on campus or feel targeted because of their religion or heritage. This executive order reaffirms and strengthens the commonwealth’s commitment to safe educational environments free from discrimination and continues our actions against antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry in public schools and institutions of higher education,” Youngkin said in a statement. “On day one, I signed Executive Order 8 establishing the Commission to Combat Antisemitism. We have made tremendous strides implementing their recommendations, but our work is far from done.” 
Under the executive order, the governor directed the Secretary of Education, the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE), and the State Council of Higher Education of Virginia (SCHEV) to develop resources that will help local school divisions, colleges and universities prevent, track, report and follow up on incidents of antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry. 
The governor also directed the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Public Safety & Homeland Security to establish a working group to design a comprehensive reporting and tracking mechanism for alleged incidents targeting Jewish students. The working group — which will include representatives from VDOE, SCHEV, the Department of Criminal Justice Services and stakeholders from the Jewish community, among others —  must provide recommendations for executive, legislative, and budgetary actions to the governor and General Assembly by Sept. 1. 
Between April 2024 and April 2025, CAM found the number of harassment cases increased from 50 to 158 and vandalism from 19 to 62, Youngkin’s order stated. Three assaults were also identified in April of this year, while none were reported in 2024. 
The order also states that these trends have placed Virginia 11th in the nation for the number of reported antisemitic incidents, most of which occurred in Virginia’s public schools and universities.
Anti-war protests roiled Virginia college campuses  after Hamas, a militant group, unexpectedly attacked Israel near the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages. Israel struck back with a full-scale war campaign that has left over 52,000 Palestinians dead to date.
Both Hamas and Israel began exchanging hostages and prisoners between January and March and the groups are still negotiating a ceasefire agreement. In the meantime, federal lawmakers, including Virginia U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, are urging President Donald Trump’s administration to act on delivering food and emergency aid to civilians.
With Gaza facing starvation, Virginia Sens. Warner and Kaine press for U.S. action

The violence and hostages taken led to a string of campus protests, encampments, and arrests at Virginia’s colleges and universities in the months to follow at the University of Mary Washington, Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Tech, and the University of Virginia.
In total, more than 125 students from five Virginia institutions of higher learning were arrested at on-campus demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas War in 2023.
Virginia lawmakers have sought answers in hopes of determining if the demonstrations and universities’ responses to them warrant potential policy changes. Despite the committees being formed a year ago, no action has been taken.
In March, the U.S. Department of Education warned 60 higher education institutions, including George Mason University and the University of Virginia, that they could lose federal funding, after the federal agency claimed the institutions have not kept Jewish students safe based on a backlog of complaints.
After George Mason responded to the December 2023 complaint, the institution said the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education has requested no further information after providing the office with an update of its efforts to combat harassment and discrimination.

Studies show that extreme precipitation and flooding are increasing in the Northeast and that coastlines are becoming more vulnerable due to changing frequency and intensity of storms and severe rain.
The post Flooding in Massachusetts drains money, energy, and resources appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","FOR OVER 50 years Lenny Linquata has owned a stretch of harbor and land on the waterfront where he runs the Gloucester House restaurant, the 7 Seas Whale Watch, and a charter boat company. He inherited it from his family, which, he said, has been living in the area for over 100 years.  One to three times a year, the parking lot that sits in between the businesses floods. The businesses used to as well, but over the past 20 years, Linquata has done several renovations to raise the elevation of his businesses.  “We do it because of need and because of anticipation,” he said. “Obviously we can see the water level rise.” Linquata, like many other waterfront businesses and homeowners, has been dealing with damaging coastal storms that result in property loss and flooding.   The state has identified the entire coastline as an “at risk” area for coastal flooding and storm surges. And, about a fifth of residential land in Massachusetts is in a Federal Emergency Management Agency designated flood plain.  As extreme precipitation increases in the Northeast, flooding both along the coast and inland is threatening the safety of residents across the states and becoming more costly. In July 2023, Vermont experienced near-record flash and river flooding that resulted in two deaths and almost $100 million in damage. In Massachusetts, severe flooding caused damage in Worcester and Bristol counties, which received more than $7 million from FEMA. According to the state’s 2023 ResilientMass Plan, Massachusetts experiences a substantial flood event once every three years.  Flooding is expensive for both individuals and the government– as critical infrastructure including schools, hospitals, highways, and utilities find themselves increasingly located in flood plains. On average, FEMA has spent $46 billion a year on flood damage over the last decade. Massachusetts estimates the cost of annual flood damage will increase to $9.3 million by 2030.  The threat of flooding has put Linquata and his businesses in a unique situation. He needs to have his buildings, such as the one from which he runs his harborside restaurant, to be high enough to avoid flooding, but also needs to have some of them, like his charter boat and whale watching businesses, to be low enough to the water for accessibility.  “Our facilities have to be mostly hanging over the water, and they have to be workable enough that they can’t be built so high out of the water,” he said. “We attempt to keep raising them out of the flood plain.” Thus far this plan has worked for him. When he knows bad weather is coming, he doesn’t leave anything that could damage his facilities on the ground level.  But as flooding worsens, help from the federal government is waning. The Trump administration announced on April 4 that it was ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program – pulling back approximately $882 billion in funding meant to help municipalities prepare for extreme weather events and other effects of climate change. The administration announced in late April that it was cutting 20 percent from FEMA’s workforce. At the same time, the agency is removing climate-related tools, like ones that predicts coastal erosion, from its website.  One Massachusetts lawmaker is trying to create a program through which the state would buy properties at risk of flood damage or allocate funds to help property owners secure their homes to help reduce monetary loss. Sen. Bruce Tarr, a Republican from Gloucester, proposed a special commission to consider the creation of a loan program for properties prone to flooding. It would allow Massachusetts to create its own state buyout program, similar to the FEMA managed retreat program on the national level. “This bill would provide an important means of access to the resources that homeowners would need to be able to be proactive, either by elevating the home [or] using other methods that make it more resilient,” Tarr said. The legislation would also allow the state to purchase property that can’t be made resilient, he added.  Tarr said this bill aims not only to fill the gaps left by FEMA’s program but to take pressure off the municipal tax base.  Tarr has filed this bill in every legislative term since 2019. He believes it’s not moving out of committee because “there isn’t the same sense of urgency with every legislator.” “I don’t think we’ve come to the full realization of how much of a threat this situation is,” he said. “That is not to say that they are unsympathetic. I very much believe there’s an interest in trying to respond, but I don’t think there’s been a feeling or urgency, and maybe a feeling that these threats are far enough in the future that we don’t need to yet develop this type of a plan.” “We need to shift the model that we currently have,” he added. Last year, Gov. Maura Healey announced $5.2 million in state grants to support coastal communities dealing with the impacts of climate change. The Office of Coastal Zone Management is funding 16 projects to facilitate shoreline management, erosion control, and infrastructure resilience. Some communities on the coast are creating their own solution to flooding programs.  In August 2024, Boston launched the Office of Climate Resilience to address climate change’s effect on the city and its residents. Chris Osgood, the office’s director, said that the city has a plan that includes training residents on how to deal with rising water. “We are a city one-sixth of which is built on landfill and or filled tidelands and as a result of as a result of that, there are a number of low-lying areas along the coastal front, and so if left undressed, that means that the sea level rise and storm surge that we’re expecting would have a significant impact, not just on waterfront properties, but on significant sections of our city,” Osgood said.  The strategy also includes improving the city’s messaging system and working on the Office of Emergency Management’s near-term flood forecasting system.  Midterm strategies include projects that lower the risk of flooding in neighborhoods of concern. So far, the city has completed coastal restoration projects in Piers Park in East Boston and Langan Park in the North End to enhance the coastline.  The city’s long-term strategy is a coastal storm risk management study being done with the US Army Corp of Engineers, which has “the opportunity to unlock potentially millions of dollars worth of funding over decades,” according to Osgood. The study is on track to be submitted to Congress in 2028.  The town of Salisbury, which is located between a beach and a river, is another example of an area especially prone to flooding. Local officials added tens of thousands of tons of sand to the beaches to help protect houses from erosion and flooding. The dunes were quickly washed away, according to Salisbury resident and former selectman Chuck Takesian, and it left the town more vulnerable to flooding and the elements.  “[The dunes] were placed strategically on a slope that scientists recommended, so we just plop the sand down,” he said. “When the waves hit it, it started to erode the dune.”  It initially cost the town $600,000 to install the dunes, just for one storm to wash them away in less than a week, according to NBC Boston. The state later stepped in, allocating $1.75 million for a project to restore the dunes.  As a flooding victim, Linquata hopes that the government is looking to the future when addressing flood-related issues. “Building structures to keep water out is only a temporary solution,” he said. At the same time, he acknowledged the issues that come with living on the water.  “A person makes that choice,” he said. “If a person makes that choice, there’s a risk that goes with that choice.” The post Flooding in Massachusetts drains money, energy, and resources appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Flooding.jpg?fit=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 10:05:46.239341

The Louisiana […],"A utility crew restores power at a New Orleans intersection after Hurricane Francine in September 2024. (John Gray/Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – The recent end to a state-led energy efficiency program combined with massive layoffs last month at the federal agency that provides electric bill assistance to low-income households have residents of greater New Orleans worried about how they are going to cool their homes during the hottest months of the year.
The Louisiana Public Service Commission, which regulates electric utilities for most of the state,  eliminated an energy efficiency program that it had been working on for over a decade in mid-April. In early April, the Trump administration fired all of the Low Income Energy Assistance Program’s staff, leaving the future of the program in jeopardy.
Without state-level plans to increase energy assistance, spending on electricity will probably rise, experts said. And with LIHEAP in the lurch, people might not be able to access assistance they need to pay those high bills.
Logan Burke, the executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy called the LIHEAP cuts “outrageous,” especially because there are already few avenues for energy bill assistance. Burke said that Louisiana spent 7% of its LIHEAP funds on weatherizing homes last year, and that if LIHEAP doesn’t continue, then there will be no low-income weatherization or efficiency programs in the state.
“The problem here is that those are the minimal backstops that people have depended on for decades — the LIHEAP dollars — both for bill assistance and weatherization of housing, and without them, we simply lose billions of dollars of bill assistance and efficiency upgrades in low income housing,” Burke said.

Local LIHEAP administrators are silent on how the layoffs will affect residents or the future funding. The Louisiana Housing Corporation — which is in charge of distributing funds to parish organizations that then go through applications and work with residents to provide aid — did not respond to phone calls. Neither did JeffCAP, Jefferson Parish’s LIHEAP distributor, or Total Community Action in New Orleans.
State scraps energy efficiency program
Even though the average unit cost of electricity is lower in Louisiana than much of the rest of the country, Louisianians use the highest amounts, leading to high bills, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, and average rates have only been increasing in recent years. Between 2018 and 2024, the base rate for energy bills in Louisiana increased 40%, and is expected to increase 30% in the next 15 years, according to analysis from the financial consulting firm BAI Group. Extreme weather, old housing infrastructure and Louisiana’s reliance on natural gas, a volatile market, are all partly responsible for the high prices, experts said.
“A lot of our housing stock is old and simply isn’t good at retaining heated and cooled air,” Burke said. “So a lot of our energy is just wasted around leaks and cracks around our windows and doors.”
For the past 14 years, the Louisiana Public Service Commission had been working on an energy efficiency program that would have helped residents identify ways to consume less energy by making every unit of power go further — through renovations such as increased insulation in homes or upgraded thermostats, Burke said. But the commission abruptly voted to dissolve the program less than a month before contractors were slated to report to the commission about how the program would work. Republican commissioners said the administrative costs of the program would be too high.
The decision frustrated residents of the greater New Orleans area who struggle to pay their energy bills and were looking for state support to lower costs.
“Because if you go around sealing up all these cracks and holes in these old houses, don’t you think now they’re going to use less to heat and cool their homes?” said Dorginia Lucas, a Metairie resident. “That’s why I would drop it too if I was them. ‘Why would I help you lower your bill?’ That’s how I look at it.”
Lucas said she has been working since 14 years old, but still struggles to pay her utility bills, which range between $249 to $440. She said dealing with Entergy’s billing system is frustrating and overwhelming.
A recent report by the Louisiana Association of United Ways, a coalition of nonprofits that connect residents with health and financial aid resources, found that wages haven’t been increasing at the same rate as basic necessities in recent years, making household costs difficult to cover, even in families with steady incomes. And utility assistance has been one of the most sought-after aid requests over the past decade in Orleans Parish (with an exception in 2021 after Hurricane Ida), according to caller data from counseling service center Vialink.
The need for energy assistance has grown
Entergy distributes funds to nonprofits for its utility assistance program, “The Power to Care,” that aids seniors and people with disabilities. The New Orleans Council on Aging distributes those funds to residents in Orleans Parish.
Howard Rodgers, the executive director of the New Orleans Council on Aging, said there is a “tremendous need” for assistance paying utility bills in the city. Rodgers said seniors particularly need assistance because they might rely on benefits and need to pay for medication, which might lead them to deprioritize utility payments to the detriment of their health.
The New Orleans Council on Aging helps around 10,000 to 15,000 people every year through “The Power to Care” program, Rodgers said, and most funds come from charitable donations that Entergy matches. But the program has also changed in recent years. Due to high demand, the Council on Aging no longer accepts walk-ins for utility bill assistance. Additionally, those seeking help have a $500 cap on assistance every year. Rodgers said this allows the council to provide assistance to more people.
That might not go too far for many residents. A 2023 Verite News analysis found that the average Entergy bill in New Orleans was $179 in 2022.
And consumer advocates worry that the situation could get worse. Last year, the New Orleans City Council voted to approve the sale of Entergy New Orleans’s gas business utility to a company backed by private equity. Energy advocates and community members spoke out against the sale, saying that it might increase rates for energy users. Louisiana’s investments in exporting liquified natural gas abroad could also lead to higher energy costs at home, according to a Department of Energy report from last September.
Jannie Yarbrough, a retired New Orleans resident, said she lives alone and pays around $185 to $200 per month, a squeeze on fixed retirement income. Yarbrough said the city and state could be doing more to lower energy costs.
Yarbough said she could ask her daughter to help out, but doesn’t want to depend on her.
“I’m blessed that I have a daughter that could pay, but I’m not trying to depend on my child,” Yarbrough said.
Despite the rising costs of gas, public assistance pathways for utility payments are also dwindling at the local level. Last July, the city’s Office of Community Development shuttered its emergency rental and utility assistance program after four years. The office didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Entergy has its own energy efficiency program, but it still gets paid for funds it may lose from lower energy energy consumption — a program called “Quick Start,” according to the Alliance for Affordable Energy. Quick Start will expire at the end of the year, and on May 19 the Louisiana Public Service Commission voted to initiate a three month process to look at and make changes to the program and another that helps public entities with energy efficiency.
Under an independent, state-run energy efficiency program, Entergy wouldn’t be able to earn back potential profits it lost from energy efficiency upgrades.
Rodgers said the Council on Aging is anticipating a higher demand for utility assistance since the LIHEAP layoffs. He said he has already spoken to Entergy employees about the possibility of the end of LIHEAP. An Entergy New Orleans spokesperson did not respond to questions about if and how assistance pathways might change if LIHEAP ended, but said the company’s rates are consistently below the national average and that customers can contact the utility for bill management resources.
“We won’t know what to do until it happens,” Rodgers said. “We can think about it, plan for it, but then we are just going to have to be reactionary when that happens.”

Over 150 participants joined the Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition (DBCC) virtually on May 14 for the organization’s 27th Annual Breast Cancer Update, themed “The State We’re In.” 
The Zoom-based event brought together healthcare professionals, advocates, and community members to explore pressing issues in breast cancer care, including racial disparities, access to screening, and advances in prevention and treatment.
The program opened with a presentation from Dr. Scott Siegel, who outlined the disproportionate impact of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) on Black women in Delaware. He noted that Black women are 40% more likely to die from breast cancer, with lower screening rates and a higher likelihood of late-stage diagnosis.
 “The greatest opportunity to reduce disparities,” he stated, “is by addressing prevention.” Dr. Siegel also highlighted geographic hotspots for late-stage breast cancer and introduced targeted strategies like deploying community health workers and using precision public health tools to close the equity gap.
Kendra Flores, another speaker at the event, underscored the evolving role of genetic testing in risk assessment and treatment decisions.
 “Genetic differences are what makes us, us,” she said, encouraging patients to revisit genetic testing every two to three years. She also highlighted the importance of interpretation services and introduced the Tyrer-Cuzick model for evaluating hereditary risk.

Dr. Karen Louie shared national screening statistics and updated recommendations, noting a steady decline in breast cancer deaths since 2014. She recommended early and enhanced screening protocols for individuals at high risk, and discussed prevention strategies including lifestyle changes and surgical options.
Zachary Bernard, the 2025 DBCC Grant Recipient, presented research from The Chanpyon Project, which seeks to improve breast cancer screening rates in Sussex County’s Haitian community. Bernard identified transportation issues and misinformation as key barriers.
 “The integration of credible messengers and culturally tailored outreach was key to overcoming barriers,” he said.

Nutritionist and breast cancer survivor Dee Iraca offered practical advice for reducing modifiable risk factors through diet and lifestyle. Her session emphasized mindful eating, gut health, and the impact of sleep quality, and concluded with a live cooking demonstration. She also addressed soy consumption, referencing research that links early-life intake with reduced risk of breast cancer.
A range of sponsors, including Delaware Health and Social Services, Beebe Healthcare, Delaware First Health, and Gilead Oncology supported the event.
 “The Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition is profoundly grateful for the generous support of our sponsors for the 27th Annual Breast Cancer Update,” said DBCC CEO Francesca Vogel.

OTTAWA COUNTY — Local, state and national officials are warning that unless Michigan environmental officials can fast-track PFAS regulations to allow for harbor dredging this year, it could end up costing Ottawa County residents millions.
The problem arose when the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) implemented a new policy that requires testing for PFAS chemicals in sediment prior to being removed from federal harbors and channels.
The new requirement has caused confusion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which said it cannot proceed with dredging Ottawa County’s Grand Haven inner harbor until EGLE determines how PFAS will impact the silt and sediment to be dredged.
“EGLE has not been clear regarding the terms of this policy, the extent to which this policy change could disrupt harbors and shipping throughout our state and the Great Lakes system, the relevant PFAS thresholds and disposal requirements, and the timing of implementation,” said U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, who represents Michigan’s Fourth Congressional District, which includes the southern half of Ottawa County. “If these matters are not properly addressed, the communities I represent could face serious economic harm.”
 How we got here

PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of manmade chemicals used in various products and industries, including firefighting foams, stain repellents, and non-stick cookware.
Other sources can come from industrial sites, such as power plants, as in Grand Haven. The coal-fired J.B. Sims Plant, which closed in 2020 and was demolished in 2021, left coal ash on the site, which contains contaminants like mercury, cadmium, arsenic and PFAS.
Exposure in humans can lead to a range of health problems, including increased cholesterol, changes in the immune system, potential developmental delays and increased risk of certain cancers. There’s also evidence suggesting a link between PFAS and thyroid disease, liver damage and reproductive issues such as decreased fertility.
As the chemicals became known to state environmental regulators — there are seven known PFAS sites in Ottawa County — policies were developed to help identify and monitor new contamination sites.
That led to a new policy from EGLE’s Water Resources Division in 2018 to require harbor sediment be tested for PFAS prior to dredging.
Dredging is the process of removing sediments and debris from the bottom of water bodies to maintain navigable waterways, deepen channels for larger vessels, and support various infrastructure projects.
The U.S. Corps of Engineers’ Detroit District maintains a navigation system of 81 harbors and channels on the Great Lakes. Some harbors, such as Muskegon, require annual dredging, while others, such as Grand Haven’s inner harbor, might be dredged every two to four years, depending on factors such as river sediment accumulation, coastal erosion and water levels.
“We have to keep the channel dredged,” Grand Haven Mayor Bob Monetza told WGHN in April. “It gets full of sediment and gets shallow in places where boats can get hung up, or they might have to come in with lighter loads.”
The Grand River is typically kept at a depth of about 23 feet.
Every five years, harbors must apply for their Clean Water Act Section 401 Certification through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Grand Haven was due to apply for its re-certification in November, but when the location was one of 17 harbors in Michigan identified with nearby PFAS-contributing sites — the former Sims site is about 2.5 miles from the outer harbor — EGLE implemented the new PFAS testing standard for the site.
“It kind of came out of nowhere, but they want us to start sampling the river bottom for PFAs, because there’s PFAs in the river in the sediment that washes downstream from farther upstream,” Monetza told WGHN.
The “inner harbor” generally refers to the area closer to land, while the “outer harbor” is further from shore, where breakwaters or other structures are found to protect the harbor from strong waves and currents.
Meanwhile, the state has yet to establish PFAS standards for the sediment testing, causing confusion between the agencies about which levels are acceptable to allow dredging to proceed as well as who pays for the process.
Huizenga, in a letter to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, said the Corps said at the Great Lakes Navigation meeting in November that the new testing requirements will reduce the number of harbors that are dredged annually and could drive up costs by up to 70%.



Standards for PFAS levels and disposal are still being circulated for review and have yet to be made available by the state. Even if the testing process is sorted out and performed, Monetza said it could take six months to a year to confirm the plan for Grand Haven.



“They’ll take a long period of time to analyze and decide what they’re going to do, what kind of permits they’ll issue,” he said.
The Corps also announced it was pushing back the Grand Haven project until 2026, prompting deep concerns from local, state and federal officeholders.
“This is the equivalent of writing a speeding a ticket when there is no posted speed limit,” Huizenga, a Republican, said on his website.
Liz Wilkinson, operations manager at the Corps’ Grand Haven office, described the delay as “unlucky timing.”
“It was just kind of unfortunate, unlucky timing that Grand Haven needed to be coordinated right at about the time that EGLE felt like they were ready to start doing this testing with PFAS. We had it planned for this year. We had it budgeted for this year because we knew it was needed,” Wilkinson told The Grand Haven Tribune last month.
 Officials warn of economic impacts

U.S. Rep. Hillary Scholten wrote a letter in April urging Whitmer of the economic impacts of not dredging Grand Haven’s harbor. The congresswoman, a Democrat, represents Michigan’s Third Congressional District, which includes the northern half of Ottawa County.



She said Grand Haven’s harbor is “an economic powerhouse” that supports over 450 jobs totaling $29.5 million in wages annually, as well as producing a regional impact of $88.8 million per year.



“A missed dredging cycle will come at a high price. Delays will directly affect our partners across the state who rely on materials to complete transportation projects and agriculture operations, with road-building materials, concrete, asphalt, and fertilizer expected to increase in cost by more than $1 million annually,” Scholten said in the letter.
She said lighter loads and more freighter trips will result in price hikes for consumers that could reach $3 to $5 million a year.
“If we see delayed dredging, goods being shipped through Grand Haven may increase in cost by roughly $3 to $5 million annually — costs that will likely be passed through to consumers,” Scholten wrote. “In the instance that Grand Haven becomes unnavigable for commercial vessels, it is understood that neighboring harbors do not have the capacity to accept those supplies.”
The Corps announced in April it was actually moving up the dredging schedule for Holland Harbor after a shoal — a submerged ridge or bank of sand or gravel that lies close to the water’s surface — developed over the winter across the entrance to the harbor, which could have caused the shipping industry to lose $1.4 million to $1.9 million per year due to ships having to carry lighter loads, according to WGVU Public Media.
King Co. Inc., based in Holland, will dredge about 12,400 cubic yards of sediment hydraulically. The project will cost $344,480 out of a three-project contract that also includes Grand Haven and St. Joseph harbors.
Ottawa County Commissioner Josh Brugger, who represents Grand Haven, Spring Lake and Ferrysburg, also wrote to Whitmer urging the state to find a solution.
Monetza, Spring Lake Mayor Richard Carlson, Spring Lake Township Supervisor Jerry Rabideau and Spring Lake Village President Mark Powers also signed onto Brugger’s message.


“We wish to underscore the message that, without a timely resolution, this major port cannot be maintained, and our local economy may be significantly harmed,” Brugger wrote. “We are appealing for your assistance to expedite the process.”

Scholten said time is of the essence.
“At a time of grave economic uncertainty and rising prices due to tariffs for the industries, we do not need to add to the increased production costs. This problem is still solvable,” she said. “When it comes to the shipping, construction, and agricultural industries, time is not a luxury we have.”

The Census Bureau's Vintage 2024 estimates released last week found that about four in five Bay State municipalities counted more residents on July 1, 2024 than a year earlier.
The post Census shows recent growth in most Mass. cities and towns appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MOST MASSACHUSETTS cities and towns experienced a slight growth in residents from 2023 to 2024, boosting the state’s population amidst continuing concerns about outmigration, according to new US Census Bureau data.The Census Bureau’s Vintage 2024 estimates released last week found that about four in five Bay State municipalities counted more residents on July 1, 2024 than a year earlier, fueling the nearly 1 percent statewide population growth over the same span that officials previously announced.Boston, the state’s largest city, led the pack in total growth, with 8,855 new residents pushing its population to more than 673,000, the data show. That’s a rate of about 1.3 percent.Some smaller communities expanded at higher rates. Stoneham added 1,452 people over the one-year period, a nearly 6.3 percent growth rate that led all 351 cities and towns. Among larger municipalities with at least 50,000 residents, the most significant population change was in Revere, which grew 2.94 percent.Sixty-one communities lost population year over year. The biggest loss, both in terms of raw total and percent change, was Concord, whose population shrunk 181 people or roughly 1 percent.Secretary of State William Galvin’s office said most of the towns with population decreases were concentrated in western Massachusetts or Barnstable County.



It appears Massachusetts is part of a larger regional trend.“In 2024, the Northeast experienced population growth after years of steady decline, with rates ranging from an average growth of 0.1 percent in cities and towns with fewer than 5,000 people (a shift from the 0.3 percent average decline in 2023) to 1.0 percent average growth in cities with populations of 50,000 or more — five times higher than their growth rate during 2023,” the Census Bureau wrote in a news release last week.Nationally, the largest average population growth was in the South, the Census Bureau said, while the western part of the country also saw increases and the Midwest experienced “modest population growth.”The new municipal data build on statewide totals released in December. The Census Bureau counted 7,136,171 people living in Massachusetts as of July 1, 2024, an increase of nearly 70,000 or close to 1 percent over a year earlier.Thousands of people continue to leave Massachusetts for other states, but newly incoming immigrants have more than made up for it in recent years, the data show. From July 1, 2023 to July 1, 2024, the Census Bureau reported that about 27,500 people decamped Massachusetts for another state — down from 36,500 the prior year and 54,800 the year before that.In each of those years, international migration to the Bay State surpassed 72,000, climbing to 90,200 from July 1, 2023 to July 1, 2024.The UMass Donahue Institute previously called the 2023-to-2024 trend the Bay State’s largest annual population increase in 60 years. The Pioneer Institute later suggested the growth was linked to an increase in humanitarian migrants who are now being more accurately counted.Beacon Hill has been closely watching migration patterns, especially as business groups and others warn of people leaving Massachusetts due to the state’s high cost of living.Galvin’s office echoed the Donahue Institute analysis last week, attributing the year-over-year growth to slowing domestic outmigration to other states as well as “record levels of international migration.”“Accurate population counts are crucial for state and local governments, because they dictate federal funding for things like schools, transportation, and health care,” Galvin, a Democrat who is the state’s 2030 US Census Liaison, said. “If people are living in Massachusetts, using those resources, and contributing to our local economy, we must push back against any efforts to exclude them from the count.”From July 1, 2020 to July 1, 2024, the Census Bureau’s Vintage series counts an increase in the Bay State’s population of about 141,000 people or 2 percent.The post Census shows recent growth in most Mass. cities and towns appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot_20-5-2025_9240_www.statehousenews.com_.jpeg?fit=1024%2C799&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 10:05:46.239341

The newly refurbished Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame Monday held a celebration of something Mississippians do as well as well as anyone anywhere. I am writing, of course, of college baseball, played here and supported by Magnolia State fans as well as – and perhaps better than – anywhere else.
Southern Miss’s JB Middleton, one of the best pitchers in college baseball, took home the Boo Ferriss Trophy, which goes annually to the state’s best player. It was a day for hard-throwing, small-town right-handers at the Hall of Fame. Middleton, a junior from Yazoo City, won the trophy named for the late Dave “Boo” Ferriss, another right-handed pitching ace from Shaw. Roy Oswalt, from Weir, who won 163 games pitching for four Major League teams, was the featured speaker. 

Rick Cleveland
Middleton, expected to be a high choice in the upcoming Major League Draft, won over Delta State right-hander Drake Fontenot and three sluggers: Southern Miss second baseman Nick Monistere, Mississippi State third baseman Ace Reese and Ole Miss third baseman Luke Hill.
Ferriss, a Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer, surely would approve of Middleton’s amazing numbers produced this spring. USM’s Friday night ace won nine games, lost only one and had an earned run average of 2.05. In this college baseball era of soaring offensive numbers, Middleton allowed opponents to hit only .167. Perhaps most impressive of all was his strikeouts-to-walks ratio. He fanned 104 batters and walked only 23. He is the state’s only semifinalist for the Golden Spikes Award, which goes annually to the nation’s best amateur baseball player.
“JB’s a true Friday night ace,” Southern Miss coach Christian Ostrander said. “You get the ball in his hand, you’ve got a chance to win … obviously, we wouldn’t be where we are without him.”
The Golden Eagles, 41-13 and winners of 15 straight headed into the postseason, also wouldn’t be where they are without Monistere. The former Northwest Rankin star and Mississippi high school player of the year Monday was named the Sun Belt Conference’s most outstanding player after a regular season in which he slammed 18 home runs, knocked in 66 runs and batted .332.
“To have two of the five finalists for this prestigious award speaks volumes,” Ostrander said. “We’ve got a lot of really good players having great seasons this year.”
The three other Ferriss finalists also produced eye-popping numbers:

Reese, a Texan and a sophomore transfer from Houston, was also named first team All-SEC and the league’s Newcomer of the Year on Monday. The sophomore hit .369 (a whopping .402 in SEC games) with 21 home runs and 66 runs batted in.
Hill, a second team All-SEC selection, hit .345 with eight home runs and 35 RBI and led the SEC with 12 stolen bases in league play.
Fontenot, Delta State’s Friday night ace and the Gulf South Conference’s Pitcher of the Year, won nine games and lost three with an ERA of 2.50. At one point he set a school record with 39.1 consecutive innings of scoreless baseball.

Oswalt regaled the awards luncheon crowd with stories of his fascinating career, during which he had back-to-back 20-win seasons with the Houston Astros and was the Most Valuable Player of the 2005 National League Championship Series. 
He told about how Weir Attendance Center never had a baseball team or a baseball field until he came along with his 90 mph fastball as a 14-year-old. “My daddy was a logger and he cut down trees and cleared the area that became our baseball field,” Oswalt said. Weir played 17 games that first season. Oswalt pitched 15 of those, all complete games.

Long before, he pitched in the Major Leagues, Roy Oswald was a legend in Weir. Credit: MSHOF
He also told a story about how, as a minor leaguer, he recovered from a serious shoulder injury in a most unorthodox fashion. His throwing shoulder was aching badly at the end of the 1999 season and he thought for sure the injury would require major surgery. Then, he got back home to Weir with hunting season about to begin.
“I was working on my hunting truck that had an engine that was missing,” Oswalt said. “I was fooling around with some spark plug wires and got shocked. Man, I mean, I got shocked. The current shot up from my hand and to my shoulder. I felt it throughout my whole body. It shocked the fire out of me, but once I recovered from the initial shock I realized my shoulder didn’t hurt anymore. It was fine after that.”
To his credit, Oswalt did not advise any of the Ferriss Trophy finalists to try the same treatment should they ever suffer a sore arm.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/19173753/JB-Middleton.jpg,,,2025-05-20 09:02:39.074162

Jaclyn Durant, a school social worker at Richey Elementary in the Red Clay Consolidated School District, has been named Delaware’s 2025 Behavioral Health Professional of the Year.
“I approach my work through a trauma-informed, relationship-based lens, integrating nervous system regulation strategies into the supports I provide,” Durant said.
The announcement was made by Governor Matt Meyer and Secretary of Education Cindy Marten during a statewide ceremony Monday nigh honoring top behavioral health professionals across Delaware’s school districts and charter networks.
Durant, who has served the Red Clay community for 17 years, was recognized for her trauma-informed, relationship-based approach to student support. Her work emphasizes emotional regulation and wellness, helping students thrive both in and out of the classroom.
Among the initiatives she’s led at Richey Elementary are morning emotional check-ins and classroom regulation stations — spaces equipped with tools such as breathing tracers, yoga cards, and fidget items designed to help students manage stress and return to learning.

The bilingual morning check-in system, featuring the school mascot, allows teachers to assess students’ emotional states as they arrive each day. Students use a feelings chart to express how they’re doing, giving staff early insight into who might need additional support.
“As more students began arriving at school dysregulated, I recognized the need for both a daily emotional check-in and accessible Tier 1 regulation supports throughout the day,” Durant said.
Each fall, Durant visits every homeroom to teach students how to use the stations effectively.
She says this proactive approach has helped students build emotional awareness and develop self-management skills — a sentiment echoed by staff at the school.
“Jaclyn is the heart of our school community. She brings a tireless work ethic and a profound sense of empathy to her role each day,” said Richey Principal Gregg Johnson. “Whether she is supporting students through personal struggles, helping families navigate challenges outside of school, or connecting them with critical community resources, her work is consistently rooted in care, equity and dignity.”
Durant’s recognition is part of the Delaware Department of Education’s Behavioral Health Professional of the Year program, which honors school counselors, psychologists, nurses, and social workers who make significant contributions to student mental health.
As the state honoree, Durant will receive a $3,000 award from the Department of Education, along with $5,000 for use on student-related initiatives. She also received a $2,000 award from her district for being Red Clay’s nominee.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.png,,,2025-05-20 09:02:39.074162

(Bryce campaign photo)Randy Bryce, the former iron worker who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Wisconsin’s First District in 2018, is taking another shot at the seat, focusing again on a pitch for voters to send an everyday worker to Washington.
Bryce announced Tuesday he would seek the Democratic nomination to run against Republican incumbent Bryan Steil in 2026.
Bryce said he expects the top issues in the race to be preserving Social Security and other safety net programs, resisting  President Donald Trump’s steep tariffs and attacks on immigrants and pushing back against the general climate of fear as Republicans enact the Trump agenda. 
“I cannot sit and just watch this happen,” Bryce said in an interview Monday. “And with Trump it’s even worse now, with people literally being afraid.”
Bryce’s first 2026 campaign video, launched Tuesday morning, hearkens back to the 2018 campaign, when “one man stood up to Washington,” in the words of the opening narration. “He’s not a politician or a billionaire. He’s something much more rare in Congress, someone who actually works for a living.”
The video puts Trump and his policies front and center, and it depicts the 2026 campaign as finishing a job that Bryce began in his first run for the seat.
When the president’s image first appears, the narrator says, “as old enemies come out of the shadows…” A follow-up shot shows a welder — Bryce — in a darkened workshop, and the narrator says, “we need him one more time.”
“I’ve never left the job unfinished,” Bryce tells the camera. “For 20 years, I’ve helped build Wisconsin with these hands while they shipped our jobs overseas. I stayed right here fighting for working families. Trump promised to bring manufacturing back. Eight years later, we’re still waiting.”
Bryce made national headlines with the 2018 race — a  campaign he launched the year before with the intention of running against the district’s 20-year incumbent, then-U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan.
Ryan, who by then was U.S. House Speaker, unexpectedly declined to run for an 11th term however. Since then Bryce has claimed credit for having “chased Paul Ryan out.”
Steil, a corporate lawyer who was once a Ryan congressional aide, ran in Ryan’s place after handily overcoming five primary election challengers.
Bryce’s campaign was widely seen as energetic and novel for the district, which has been in Republican hands since the 1994 election. With the exception of Rob Zerban in 2012, Ryan’s Democratic challengers since 2004 garnered only about a third of voters, ranging from 30% to 37%. In 2018, Bryce finished with 42%. Since that election, Democrats have cleared from 40% to 45% in the 1st CD.
Since that campaign Bryce has headlined a fundraising operation raising money for progressive political candidates, many of them with working-class backgrounds akin to his.
Bryce is entering the 2026 campaign midway through the first year of a Trump term. Progressive and Democratic Party groups who asked if he would run again pointed out that his last campaign had roughly the same timing in Trump’s first term, Bryce told the Wisconsin Examiner, and the decision to run has “been gradually building.”
Cuts to the Veterans Administration is another issue that helped push him to run, said Bryce, a U.S. Army veteran. The agency is one of several that have been disrupted by the DOGE operation (the “Department of Government Efficiency,” although it is not an official U.S. government department) that until recently was run by billionaire and Trump supporter Elon Musk.
The campaign video plays up Bryce’s longtime social media nickname, “IronStache” — trading on the thick mustache he has sported for decades. While it shows flashes of Steil’s face and includes snippets of voters who are criticizing the incumbent, neither the narration nor Bryce mention the incumbent by name.
In the interview, Bryce said in addition to working with the union and grassroots progressive groups that rallied behind him in his first race, he would make an appeal to disaffected Trump voters who are being harmed by current federal policies.
“I want to go places where Democrats normally haven’t gone,” he said. “I want to bring more people together.”
Steil is “listening to his leadership [in Congress] and his donors, he’s not listening to the people that voted for him,” Bryce charged. “And he’s not doing anything to stand up to Trump. The Constitution was drawn up to stop somebody like Trump. But Congress isn’t doing their job. They’re helping enable whatever Trump wants to go on.”

Dunbar sponsored a resolution asking the state's congressional delegation to oppose Medicaid cuts. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature has voted to urge the state’s congressional delegation to oppose cuts to Medicaid, as the state faces a potential annual loss of $194 million in federal spending and tens of thousands more uninsured residents.
The House passed Senate Joint Resolution 15 on Sunday by a vote of 27-13, and the Senate approved the final version 14-6 on Monday.
The joint federal-state program is the largest health care payer for lower-income Alaskans and a major source of nursing care for people with a wide range of incomes. The U.S. House of Representatives is considering making $625 billion in cuts over the next 10 years. 
The health-focused foundation KFF estimated that Alaska would see a loss of federal payments under the current proposal equal to $194 million this year, or 19% of federal Medicaid spending in the state. 
And state enrollment would decline by between 24,000 and 40,000, with a midpoint estimate of 32,000 fewer Alaskans enrolled in the program. 
The Senate Health and Social Services Committee sponsored the resolution. Sen. Forrest Dunbar, D-Anchorage and the committee chair, noted roughly 1 in 3 Alaskans is enrolled in the program. He referred to his family history. 
“My grandfather fought in World War II, and towards the end of his life, my mother moved him up to Fairbanks to get long-term care,” Dunbar said. “He had to have round-the-clock care; it was about $8,000 a month, which at the time was a lot of money — now it’s even more expensive. And the VA didn’t cover all of that care. We had to enroll him in the Medicaid program. And there are thousands of stories just like that.”
Under the current U.S. House proposal, the two biggest cuts would be the result of instituting work and reporting requirements for Medicaid enrollees and increasing the complexity of applying for and renewing Medicaid. 
Dunbar noted that Medicaid pays for a significant share of revenue at major health care providers, citing estimates of 25% of payments to Providence Alaska and 41% of payments to the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.  
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage, emphasized that the program enrolls most of Alaska’s children, including through school-based programs, and is a major source of health care for Alaska Natives. 
The resolution asks U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan and U.S. Rep. Nick Begich to oppose the proposed cuts “to protect the state’s health care system, communities, citizens, and economy.”
The resolution said  “Medicaid plays a crucial role in supporting the state’s small businesses and entrepreneurs by providing access to affordable health care coverage for employees, which helps prevent illness, reduces absenteeism, and improves productivity,” and that “ by ensuring workers have access to necessary medical services, Medicaid enables small businesses to retain a healthier, more reliable workforce, ultimately contributing to economic stability and growth in the state.”
Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, led the effort to pass the bill in the House and questioned whether the state can afford to take on a greater share of Medicaid spending. 
“Given our current fiscal situation, I don’t think that’s going to be realistic, in terms of delivering health care services for people who need it,” she said. 
All 21 members of the multipartisan House majority voted for the resolution, along with six minority-caucus Republicans: Reps. Jeremy Bynum of Ketchikan, Bill Elam of Nikiski, Elexie Moore of Wasilla, David Nelson of Anchorage, Mike Prax of North Pole and Justin Ruffridge of Soldotna. The other 13 minority-caucus members voted against it. 
One resolution opponent, Rep. Julie Coulombe of Anchorage, proposed an amendment to the resolution that supported “efforts to identify and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse within the Medicaid system.” Coulombe’s amendment passed.
When the amended version of the resolution returned to the Senate, Dunbar criticized the added language, which he described as a “red herring.” He also said that congressional efforts are not targeting waste, fraud and abuse, and could actually undermine some investigations of these issues. But he called for the Senate to pass it despite the added language, due to the overall goals of the resolution. 











“I would hope that whatever decision is made at the federal government, that the floor doesn’t drop out on states like Alaska — but if they’re going to decide to reduce things, that we’re given some time to adjust to that.” 


– Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy



	Twelve of the 14 Senate majority members voted for it, with Nikiski Republican Sen. Jesse Bjorkman and Fairbanks Democrat Scott Kawasaki the only majority members to vote no. Among minority-caucus Republican senators, four voted no, while Sens. Mike Cronk of Tok/Northway and James Kaufman of Anchorage voted for it. 
While resolutions like these do not go before Gov. Mike Dunleavy, when the governor was asked about his view of Medicaid and other federal cuts at a new conference on Monday, he acknowledged that the federal government is facing a growing national debt. 
“My concern is that Alaska may end up losing money in this process,” he said. “I would hope that whatever decision is made at the federal government, that the floor doesn’t drop out on states like Alaska — but if they’re going to decide to reduce things, that we’re given some time to adjust to that.”

Amid pledges from Democratic legislative leaders to make California more affordable, there is persistent evidence that the state’s high cost of living won’t get better anytime soon. 
The latest comes from California’s housing department, which recently released its annual report detailing how much households can earn in each of California’s 58 counties to be eligible for various government programs, including housing assistance programs.
One striking takeaway? Earning a six-figure salary as a single person without dependents is considered “low income” in five counties — all in Northern California.
Residents making an annual income of up to $109,700 who are living in Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties are considered low income, according to the California Department of Housing & Community Development. Topping the list is Santa Clara County, the home of Silicon Valley’s tech industry, which designates $111,700 as low income. 
For a three-person household — say, two parents with one child — earning a combined six-figure salary is also considered low income in an additional 11 counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Los Angeles, Monterey, Napa, Orange, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Sonoma and Ventura counties.
This wasn’t always the case, as SFGATE points out: Five years ago, $78,550 was considered low income for a single-person household in Santa Clara County, a difference of $33,150, or 42%, compared to now. Indeed no California county in 2020 considered a six-figure salary low income; with $97,600 standing as the low-income ceiling for Marin, San Francisco and San Mateo counties. 
The report comes as both the federal and state government plan to cut or shift funds for social safety net programs; rising insurance costs drive up rents; electric bills in California remain some of the highest in the country; and inflation is “projected to accelerate” under President Donald Trump’s tariff policies.

Though Gov. Gavin Newsom’s disputes with local governments over homelessness often grab headlines, disagreements between counties and cities also have the potential to upend the livelihoods of unhoused people who depend on local support.
As CalMatters’ Marisa Kendall explains, the saga between the city and county of Los Angeles and their soon-to-be-dissolved joint homeless services authority underscores the friction between local governments, which are sometimes at odds with each other when it comes to funding and responsibility. It’s a kind of clash that’s happening elsewhere in California, such as San Diego and Stanislaus counties.
Established in the 1990s, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority provided services to some of L.A. County’s 75,000 homeless people. After two audits found that the joint agency failed to properly track spending and outcomes, the county’s Board of Supervisors voted last month to rescind more than a third of the agency’s funding, or more than $300 million. L.A. County officials say they plan to create a new agency that is more efficient and will have more accountability measures. 
L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and a city councilmember blasted the move, saying it would “create a monumental disruption” and risk “worsening our homelessness crisis.”
Days after county supervisors conducted their vote, members of the L.A. City Council said they should consider pulling out of the agency too.
Cities, which provide shelter beds, do not have behavioral health departments, which are provided by counties, along with other key mental health and addiction treatments. The dismantling of L.A.’s joint agency has left programs in the region figuring out how to separate funds they receive from both the city and county.

Fear among ESL students under Trump

More than 290,000 students take free English as a Second Language courses in California’s community colleges. But as the Trump administration cracks down on immigration, educators are reporting a heightened level of anxiety that discourages ESL students from going to class, writes Delilah Brumer of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
Non-credit ESL courses have been growing in popularity in recent years: From the 2018-19 academic year to 2023-24, about 30,000 more students in California enrolled in these courses. This is a boon for community colleges, which receive state funding through ESL courses and are still struggling with enrollment after the pandemic.
But in January Trump issued several executive actions to increase deportations, including authorizing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to make arrests at schools and other “sensitive locations.” For the roughly 100,000 California college students who do not have permanent legal status, fears about ICE have led some to either attend classes online or not show up at all.

Jessica Buchsbaum, City College of San Francisco’s ESL department chairperson: “We’ve definitely heard that students may be afraid to come to school. In an environment when there’s so much hate directed at immigrants, we are here to serve this population. These are people who bring incredible energy and hope to our communities.”

Though voters in November rejected amending the state constitution to ban involuntary prison labor, a Culver City lawmaker continues to push for better pay for California prisoners — including incarcerated firefighters who help put out active wildfires. Read more from CalMatters’ Joe Garcia.

She was calm, and Tom was by her side just as he has been for the last 54 years. She showed incredible strength and resilience through 16+ years of cancer treatments, but it took a final toll on her body in the end. Chris’s calm, grounded, presence radiated from her smile, and her giant welcoming heart made so many feel at home with her. Chris was born in State College, PA, but spent most of her childhood in Minneapolis, MN with her parents and three siblings and they all enjoyed summers in Greensboro, VT.  She met her loving life partner, Tom Cavin, while in high school together at Breck School. She attended Smith College and after graduation they married in Greensboro, VT in June 1977. They moved around for Tom’s medical training, living in Boston, MA, Norwich, VT, Iowa City, IA, and then moved to South Burlington, VT in 1984 with their three young children.She was an avid tennis player and quickly developed life-long friends at the Burlington Tennis Club and on her level 4.5 team which went on to represent Vermont in a number of regional and national tournaments. Chris felt truly blessed by these friends and wanted to express deepest thanks to them for the joy they shared together on the courts and off for over 40 years. Golden retrievers and labs were another passion, and she often had a couple of these loving companions beside her on long walks. Her dogs also welcomed many litters of puppies that Chris made sure found happy homes in the local community.Chris dedicated significant time to efforts and organizations that connected people to natural places. Her knowledge and passion for trails and bikes led her to advocate, organize and spearhead the South Burlington Bike Path in the 1990s with her close friend Jill Coffrin. That path now connects neighborhoods, schools, and towns. Chris dedicated time on the board of the Winooski Valley Park District from 1995-2009 and was chair for most of those years. She helped conserve some critical natural areas for public use such as Colchester Pond. As a classroom volunteer, she shared her wonder of nature with Orchard Elementary School students. Chris loved the outdoors and enjoyed experiencing it with family and friends. Whether on the ski slopes at Stowe, sitting on the dock on Caspian Lake, picnics at Barr Hill or long walks in the woods, she liked nothing more than sharing those peaceful times with loved ones.  Chris found great joy in raising her three children and actively supported school activities, sports teams (soccer, tennis, and skiing), making intricate Halloween costumes, providing snacks and sourdough bread for all, and connecting with others in the local community in South Burlington. Chris’s last 10 years included many visits with her grandchildren, rocking babies, holding little hands, reading books, immersing herself in imaginative worlds with them, playing with trains and trucks, walks together, and laughter. Chris’s laugh would make anyone around her smile, and her grandchildren all had deep love for their special “Nona.”Chris was admired by many, and shared and inspired examples of care and kindness toward others. She and her family give thanks to all the doctors that have helped her to live so long since her original diagnosis in 2008: Drs. Gilwee, Wong, Unger, Matulonis, Cheung, Winget, Spector, Cataldo, and Steinthorsson.

,California,2025-05-20 12:35:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why California’s biggest local effort to fight homelessness is starting all over again,Marisa Kendall,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/homelessness/2025/05/la-homeless-agency/,California cities and counties are supposed to work together to help their homeless residents. But those partnerships can be fraught.,"In summary
California cities and counties are supposed to work together to help their homeless residents. But those partnerships can be fraught.


For three decades, the city and county of Los Angeles managed California’s biggest homelessness crisis together.
They had equal say in big funding decisions, and worked in tandem to coordinate housing programs through a joint city-county agency called the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority. 
But after scathing audits criticizing the homeless authority, the county is blowing up that joint agency and starting over — despite the objections of LA Mayor Karen Bass. Now, questions remain about how the shakeup will affect the more than 75,000 unhoused people living in LA County. 
It’s the most dramatic recent example of a phenomenon playing out all over California. Cities which supply shelter beds, and counties, which provide crucial mental health and addiction treatment, can’t effectively address homelessness unless they work well together. But all too often, they don’t. 
In multiple cities, mayors are publicly attacking their counties for failing to pull their weight. In San Diego, a 150-bed shelter created as a partnership between the city and county is in jeopardy, as both sides squabble over who should pay for what. In the San Joaquin Valley, the city of Turlock is refusing to let Stanislaus County fund a shelter there. A state bill that would have forced counties to pay for half the cost of city-run homeless shelters faced fierce pushback from counties, and was swiftly gutted.
There’s no shortage of evidence on why working together is beneficial. Cities don’t have behavioral health departments, or funding for those services. So when residents of city homeless shelters need mental health or addiction treatment, which they often do, that falls on the county. 
The League of California Cities and the California State Association of Counties even released a report in 2018 highlighting the importance of cities and counties addressing homelessness together. 
There is no mandate from the state that lays out how much of the responsibility should fall to a city and how much should fall to a county. Especially in tight budget years such as this one, cities don’t want to pay for services they could pass on to the county – and vice versa. And neither wants to take the blame for falling short as they struggle under the immense challenge of getting people off the street. 
While both sides bicker, the fate of real shelters that provide lifelines for real people hangs in the balance. 
“The lack of partnership between cities and counties around people living in shelters is a major problem,” said Sen. Catherine Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas, whose Senate Bill 16 would have forced counties to shoulder half the cost of city shelters until it was amended in a way that weakened her proposed requirement.
LA County overhaul
The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority formed in the 1990s as a result of a series of lawsuits claiming that homeless Angelenos couldn’t access county services. The joint agency was supposed to fix that problem by forcing the city and county to work together.
City and county officials have pointed out some of the good that came out of that partnership. The two entities are working together to improve the way they share client data across homelessness and mental health systems. They have a joint team of outreach workers that can go anywhere in the county without being restricted by the boundaries of its 88 cities, which in addition to Los Angeles include Long Beach and Glendale. 
Last year, the city of LA saw a 10% decrease in street homelessness — the first double digit decrease in at least nine years. 
LA County voters showed they were willing to pay more to address homelessness when they backed a sales tax to fund those programs in 2017 and in 2024. The new money forced the homeless services authority to grow quickly. Things didn’t go smoothly.

Two critical audits since November found the agency was failing to properly track spending and outcomes. The LA County Board of Supervisors voted last month to pull more than $300 million – more than a third of the joint agency’s funding — and more than 700 employees out of the joint authority and into a new county agency.
After that, in quick succession, the head of the joint agency said she would resign and a federal task force announced it would investigate the agency for fraud. The LA City Council is considering pulling its funding as well.
The result will be a complete overhaul of how the county administers its homelessness programs, scheduled to take about a year.
While the problems at the homeless authority were obvious, the county’s gutting of the joint agency — done over the objections of Mayor Bass — created more friction between the city and county.
In a letter to the county before the vote, Bass and Councilmember Nithya Raman warned pulling funding from the joint agency would “create a monumental disruption in the progress we are making and runs the serious risk of worsening our homelessness crisis.”
The county’s vote to do it anyway “felt like a breaking of a relationship that was moving towards greater trust,” Raman, who chairs the city’s Housing and Homelessness Committee, said in an interview.  
Now, Raman said, programs that received city and county funds through the joint agency,  such as a $170 million program that provides two-year rental subsidies, are scrambling to figure out how to separate the city and county funds. She’s also worried about shelter programs falling through the cracks during the transition.
“How are we going to make sure those shelters stay in place?” Raman asked. 
The new agency will have heightened accountability measures – something multiple audits found that the old joint-agency lacked. The agency will report to the county annually on its progress, and quarterly on an online dashboard, said Cheri Todoroff, executive director of the county’s Homeless Initiative.
By operating within the existing county infrastructure, the new agency will benefit from tools the county has been using for decades to account for spending and monitor progress, said Sarah Mahin, director of the county’s Housing for Health program, which will be a model for the new agency. 
LA County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, who spearheaded the plan to create the new agency, said the intention isn’t to keep the city out of its homelessness efforts, but to be more efficient by consolidating homeless services that are being provided across more than a dozen different county departments. The county also will review all existing contracts, and cancel the ones that aren’t delivering results, she said. 
“The city will be as involved as they choose to be,” Horvath said.
A fight over a San Diego shelter
In this year’s state of the city speech, San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria attacked his county counterparts for their “inaction” in helping unhoused people suffering from mental illness and addiction. Last month, he put the county on blast again in his email newsletter, saying it must “step up” to save a homeless shelter.
“Generally speaking, I would say where the city is responding to this with an all hands on deck approach, I don’t think the same can be said for my county or for other counties,” Gloria said in an interview with CalMatters. 
That tension came to a head with a dispute over the Rosecrans Shelter, where 150 people sleep in bunk beds inside a giant tent set up in the parking lot of the county’s psychiatric hospital. The city runs the shelter and the county provides behavioral health services, the land and utilities, via a connection to the neighboring hospital. 
The county is preparing to demolish a vacant building on that site, which will sever the shelter’s connection to water, sewer and power.

Now, the fate of the shelter residents is up in the air. Gloria wants the county to pay to reestablish the utilities, which is estimated to cost as much as $2 million. He also wants the county to relocate the shelter residents, most of whom are struggling with mental illness or addiction. They can’t stay at the shelter during the demolition, he said – it will be too disruptive.
Spencer Katz, director of strategic initiatives for San Diego County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer, disagrees. There’s no reason people can’t live at the shelter during the demolition, he said.
“With respect to the mayor, who’s neither an expert on demolition nor on behavioral health, that claim simply doesn’t hold water,” he said. 
Lawson-Remer has proposed using $800,000 in leftover federal COVID recovery funds to pay for the utility connections, Katz said, and she wants to work with the city to find the rest of the money. 
But Gloria has proposed closing the shelter, as he stares down a $258 million budget deficit. 
The city and county have until July 1, when their current agreement expires, to find a solution. 
Newsom calls out Turlock mayor
Meanwhile, in the San Joaquin Valley, another city-county dispute over homelessness caught the attention of Gov. Gavin Newsom.
“Truly a ridiculous lack of local leadership – an absolute moral failure,” the governor said last month on X.
He was talking about the city of Turlock, which has refused to allow Stanislaus County to support an existing homeless shelter in the city. The county awarded nearly $270,000 in state funding to the 50-bed shelter. But the money was contingent on the cooperation of the city, which would have to write a letter of support and allocate a token $1 to the program. 
The city said no. 
“It’s not about the dollar — it’s about accountability,” Turlock Mayor Amy Bublak said in an interview with CalMatters. The shelter is open at night, but during the day, the people who sleep there have nowhere to go – and nowhere to use the bathroom, Bublak said. As a result, the nearby businesses are complaining of public urination and other disruptions, she said. The mayor asked We Care, the organization that runs the shelter, to keep its bathroom open during the day, but they weren’t able to come to an agreement, she said.

Stanislaus County Supervisor Terry Withrow called the city’s refusal “pretty disappointing.” The people in the shelter need help, he said, and closing the program won’t make them go away. 
“I don’t know how you can turn your back on these individuals and just let them die out there,” he said. 
We Care did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement to CBS13, We Care said it might be forced to shut down the shelter without that funding.
Bill would have made counties pay more
The bill introduced by Blakespear, the Encinitas state senator, would have required counties to cover half the cost of operating city-run homeless shelters in order to be eligible for state homelessness funding. Counties came out in force against that mandate, and Blakespear removed it from the bill.
That was a disappointment for San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan. He’s leading a push to open about 1,000 new temporary housing units this year, mostly in converted motels and tiny homes – and he wants Santa Clara County to provide case management services to the residents.  
“We have basically reached our limit,” Mahan said. “We can’t defund core city services that are already understaffed. So if the county doesn’t step in…We can’t scale anymore, which means we leave thousands of people outside.”
Santa Clara County Supervisor Susan Ellenberg said the city and county already work together on many shelter programs. But she objected to forcing the county to pay for services.
“Without having any control over the number of shelters or tiny homes that the city decides to build,” she said, “we don’t have control over our budget.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012821-LAHSA-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 09:02:39.074162

California’s ESL courses gained 30,000 students over the past six years. As the Trump administration revokes student visas and escalates immigration raids, that growth is at risk.


They speak Farsi, Cantonese, Spanish and at least two dozen other languages. Some earned master’s degrees in their home countries, while others never finished middle school. At California’s community colleges, more than 290,000 students take free, non-credit English as a Second Language classes.
As immigrants, many of these students enroll in the classes to integrate into American life, advance in their jobs, support their children or build community. The classes have grown in popularity in recent years — an enrollment bright spot for the state’s community college system, which has struggled to fully rebound to pre-pandemic student counts. 
But as news of international student visa revocations and reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids during President Donald Trump’s second term spread across the state, many community colleges have seen some of these students switch to online learning, or stop showing up to class altogether.
So far there’s no statewide data on 2025 enrollment in non-credit ESL courses at California’s community colleges. But several anecdotes from professors and enrollment numbers from individual community colleges paint a similar picture: A heightened fear of ICE is driving students away. In the San Fernando Valley, one professor has lost about 15% of her enrollment this semester. In San Marcos, several classrooms abruptly transitioned from mostly in-person instruction to walls of Zoom squares.
As the semester goes on, ESL professors are offering “Know Your Rights” cards to students and informing their classes of the community college system’s pledge to not participate in federal immigration enforcement efforts. They’re also continuing to connect their students with campus resources such as food pantries and tutoring centers.
ESL classes have expanded post-pandemic
Los Angeles Pierce College began offering non-credit ESL in 2021, and last year the college hired a full-time professor to boost the program. Enrollment in the classes skyrocketed from about 50 in 2021 to more than 350 in 2024. Dennis Solares, the adult education coordinator at Los Angeles Pierce College, said that students seeking to improve their job opportunities drove the recent ESL enrollment growth.  
“We offer an opportunity that can help them communicate more, get acclimated with the community and get better jobs,” Solares said.
The classes attract a diverse swath of students. Azucena Hernandez, 42, enrolled in ESL at Palomar College in San Marcos so that she could better support her three kids with day-to-day tasks. She started as a monolingual Spanish speaker, but after several semesters she can comfortably have conversations in English.
Hernandez now volunteers in the beginner levels of ESL as a peer instructor. She said her most important takeaway from these courses is “the family made at school.”
“Every day we are learning something new, and there is companionship,” Hernandez said. “We are united to learn.”

Hernandez’s professor, Sheri Cully, has taught ESL for more than 40 years. She prioritizes civic engagement and real-world learning in her classes. One long-term project that her students work on is maintaining a community garden and advocating for its affordability and accessibility at local government meetings. Cully said she admires her students’ work ethic and resilience.
There were 30,000 more students enrolled in non-credit ESL courses across California’s community colleges during the 2023-24 academic year compared to the 2018-19 academic year, according to state data. The growth has been driven by several factors, including heightened demand for workforce training as the state’s economy expands and the college system’s push to expand ESL after the pandemic, according to a written statement to CalMatters from the California community college system’s chancellor’s office.
ESL courses bring state funding to community colleges based partially on enrollment, so several colleges have been working to continue this expansion after enrollment dropped during the pandemic. But student fears about immigration enforcement may thwart those efforts.  
Fears of ICE entering schools
An estimated 100,000 college students live in California without permanent legal status, and 3.3 million Californians live in mixed-status households, according to data from Equity Research Institute, a USC research group. Some of these students question whether coming to class is worth the risk of entering a public campus where ICE has access, and they have opted to take courses virtually. But not all students have access to a computer or Wi-Fi at home, and some older students may not be comfortable with the technology required for college courses.
Jessica Buchsbaum, the ESL department chair at City College of San Francisco, oversees a  program serving about 6,000 students, ranging from teenagers to octogenarians. She said the non-credit ESL enrollment was “growing intensely in the fall semester, but it has now softened.”
“We’ve definitely heard that students may be afraid to come to school,” Buchsbaum said. “In an environment when there’s so much hate directed at immigrants, we are here to serve this population. These are people who bring incredible energy and hope to our communities.”

In January, the Trump administration threw out policies implemented in 2011 that limited the ability of ICE agents to arrest people at churches, schools and other areas designated as “sensitive locations.” A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said the change was necessary so “criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest.”  
California’s community colleges are public campuses, meaning they are limited by federal laws from attempting to prevent ICE agents from coming onto or near spaces that are generally considered open.
Over the years, the California community college system has supported immigrant students, such as offering Dream Resource Centers and connecting students with nonprofit legal services. The system has pointed college administrators to a 2017 state law that prohibits campus police departments from “generally providing personal information… about an individual for immigration enforcement purposes, including, but not limited to, the individual’s home address or work address, unless that information is available to the public.”
The chancellor’s office refused an interview request from CalMatters for this story. In a written statement, the office said, “The mission of the California Community Colleges is to educate and provide social and economic mobility to all Californians seeking to improve their workforce and workplace skills as well as improve their English language literacy.”
ESL professors provide support and students keep learning
Rachel Cerdenio is an ESL professor at Los Angeles Pierce College and the daughter of immigrants from the Philippines. She said the years she spent watching her parents struggle to navigate life in the United States without strong English skills spurred her to teach ESL.

For Cerdenio’s intermediate courses, she created a curriculum focused on connection to the college and student success. She recently assigned students to visit a campus resource like the student health center or the library, ask questions about it and share the information with their classmates.
“I wish my parents had the experiences that I am giving my students now,” Cerdenio said. “I want them to succeed, and I want them to be part of the campus and know about the resources that are here.”
Solares has given presentations in adult education courses, including Cerdenio’s classes, about immigrant students’ rights and the resources available to students, regardless of their immigration status.
“We had a huge influx of students, but with the change in politics students are naturally scared, and so there’s students who choose not to come to classes anymore,” Solares said. “The vibe is more tense. It’s more scary. But we support the students, and we equip the professors to support their students.”

(Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities


In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
SD Senate rejects property tax credits for nonpublic education options

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside U.S. House GOP tax bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo: Trevor Bexon/Nevada Current)The Nevada State Legislature has only a fortnight remaining before it must gavel out, which means it’s crunch time for the hundreds of bills still trying to make it to Gov. Joe Lombardo’s desk.
Friday, May 16 marked the 103rd day of the session and the deadline by which most bills had to pass out of a committee. The bills subject to Friday’s deadline had already passed one chamber of the Legislature, meaning their next step is to get a floor vote in whichever chamber hasn’t already voted on it. The deadline for passing that full floor vote is this Friday, May 23.
Meanwhile, there is an avalanche of bills exempt from standard deadlines. Some of these bills are chugging along. Others are languishing in inaction and likely already dead inside, though their sponsors may still be holding out hope.
We know it’s a lot to follow, so here’s the Nevada Current’s status check on the dozens of noteworthy bills we have covered so far this session. We’ve included links to our previous coverage and links to the official legislative website where you can find out more about each bill.
This time around, we’ve broken out the bills that appear stuck in a budget committee. The rest of the bills are organized by subject. We’ve also added dates to give you a sense of how long each bill has been wherever it is.
* Notes: Bills exempt from the legislative deadline are marked with an asterisk. Lead sponsors are listed in parentheses. Bills with no lead sponsor listed are sponsored by interim committees.
 Bills stuck in budget committees

One common joke among the halls of the Legislature is that Senate Finance and Assembly Ways and Means are the committees where bills go to die.

 Headed to Lombardo’s desk

As of Monday afternoon, only four bills had actually made it to the governor’s desk — a bill funding the session, a bill covering a budget shortfall in the Secretary of State’s Office, a bill designating Jan. 27 as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and the “emergency egg bill” designed to help reduce egg prices. Lombardo signed them all.
However, four bills have passed both chambers and should soon head to Lombardo. Most prominently: Assembly Bill 530, which would allow the Clark County Commission to extend fuel revenue indexing (FRI) an additional decade beyond its current sunset date.
The bill passed both chambers with bipartisan support. The Senate vote on May 12 was 14 yeas, 6 nays. Republicans Ira Hansen and John Steinbeck voted with Democrats in support.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden will run for a fifth term representing Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. 
There has been speculation that the former Marine could make a run for the Blaine House. He said in the campaign announcement Tuesday that he “considered many options for how best to continue serving the people of Maine.” However, he believes “the surest way to restore balance in Washington is for Democrats to win back the House of Representatives.”
“I also know the path to the majority runs through Maine,” he added. 
Last November, his race against Republican Austin Theriault drew national attention as the majority party looked to regain the seat that covers a broad, rural stretch of the state. The National Republican Congressional Committee has already said it is targeting Golden’s seat in the 2026 election as a “prime pick-up opportunity.” 
With the election 18 months away, Golden said he is focused on his current responsibilities to his constituents and family. When he isn’t in Washington, Golden lives in Lewiston with his wife and two daughters. 
Former Gov. Paul LePage announced earlier this month that he will be seeking the Republican nomination to run for the 2nd District. 
Golden, who often votes across party lines, said he is “going to do what it takes to make sure no one like Paul LePage blusters his way into Congress.”
During his last reelection campaign, Golden wrote an op-ed that drew pushback from members of his own party for saying that if elected he would work with President Donald Trump. 
Though he stands with his party on reproductive rights, environmental protections and labor, Golden has supported more funding for the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall as well as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He also backed a Republican measure to require voters to provide proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote, something Democrats have said will suppress turnout, and has been a strong supporter of tariffs and said in early April that he was pleased Trump is “building his tariff agenda on the foundation of a universal 10% tariff like” Golden himself has proposed. 
During debates last fall with Theriault, Golden defended his change of heart to support a ban on assault weapons after the October 2023 shooting in Lewiston.

(Alex Cochran for Alabama Reflector)The account of what happened during a 2018 incident between an incarcerated man and three Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) officers at Donaldson Correctional Facility differs according to the parties involved.
But the results are inarguable.
The prisoner was rushed to UAB hospital with multiple injuries, including broken ribs, broken vertebrae and a collapsed lung, according to findings by a U.S. magistrate judge.


 
May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared. and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force involved have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


The injured man spent three nights in the hospital. In 2020, he sued the three officers for excessive force. The officers didn’t deny that they’d used force, but denied that it was excessive.
ADOC’s internal use of force report about the incident noted that the prisoner weighed 145 pounds, and one of the officers involved — the one who kneeled on the prisoner’s back — weighed about 300 pounds.
The officers said that the prisoner had refused an order to enter a cell. One officer then sprayed him with a chemical agent called “Sabre Red.” They said the prisoner then refused to lie down. So another officer “took him to the floor,” and the prisoner “continued to resist and engage in combative behavior.” This version of the story was used to justify the 300-pound officer “forcefully” kneeling on the man’s back, sending him to the hospital.
The ADOC supervisor who investigated the incident concluded that the use of force was necessary.
“Officers used a minimum amount of force to gain control of the situation,” he wrote in his report.
In 2021, U.S. Magistrate Judge Herman N. Johnson determined the evidence could support a finding of excessive force, and wrote the officers’ statements “cannot be reconciled with plaintiff’s verified claim that he was already handcuffed and that offers beat him, as assessed in combination with the extent of his injuries.”
Lawyers from the Alabama’s Attorney General’s Office representing the three officers negotiated a settlement of the case for $40,000, one of 94 settlements paid in excessive force claims against ADOC officers since 2020.
ADOC would not comment on specific lawsuits against officers. The Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which handles litigation involving ADOC, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The consistent details inside the recent surge in complaints against ADOC officers mirror the DOJ’s conclusion in 2020 that the state’s seeming indifference in addressing and preventing uses of force in its prisons “fosters a culture where unlawful uses of force are common.”
And despite a prison population with 4,000 fewer incarcerated people than a decade ago, uses of force inside the prisons have increased 47% during that time, according to ADOC’s own internal data.

The highest number of incidents, 2,659 across the entire system, was reported in 2020. Beginning in March 2020, ADOC facilities were locked down because of COVID, with limited movement, and no outside visits or educational programs.

ADOC does not report use of force statistics publicly, but the Reflector obtained the data through an open records request. Three maximum-security prisons reported more than 300 use of force incidents, an all-time high, in 2020. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer reported 348. Limestone Correctional Facility in Harvest reported 308, and Tutwiler Prison for Women in Wetumpka 329.
“So much of this violence by officers is senseless and unnecessary,” said former ADOC Warden David Wise, who retired from the agency in 2010 after working in the prisons for 28 years. “There’s not a convict in that system that if he refuses an order, that I can’t put in a cell without hurting him.”

Use of force vs. excessive force

ADOC policy around use of force is governed by an administrative regulation that the agency will not release publicly, but the Reflector obtained a copy.
Correctional officers are allowed to use physical force against men and women in Alabama prisons as a means of control. Force can include the use of batons, chemical sprays or electronic devices like tasers, or physical control defined as “the use of empty-hand techniques to gain control and compliance of resistance and/or combative subject.” The DOJ defines empty-hand techniques as “takedowns” unlikely to cause injury, and can include strikes or kicks.
But DOJ drew a distinction between legal uses of force that may be justified in a prison setting and ADOC’s large number of incidents it deemed unjustified under the legal standard.
In findings sent to Alabama leaders in July 2020, the DOJ said that excessive force was “used frequently” in 12 of the state’s 13 major correctional facilities for men. The report cited 17 specific incidents, as well as two that ended in deaths.
The state has argued the DOJ’s lawsuit was based on “vague and conclusory allegations” and denied the findings.
“An excessive force claim requires allegations plausibly suggesting that officials applied force ‘maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm,’” wrote William Lunsford, the lead attorney representing the state in a motion asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit. “Plaintiff’s barebones allegations fall far short of this standard.”
Former ADOC Warden Wise said officers are trained to use the minimum force necessary, and could de-escalate almost every situation by just using their voice.
“Ninety percent of the time, that’s how I got out of coming to blows with inmates. I talked to them, reasoned with them,” he explained. “I also let them know real quick that there was no way they were going to win. Usually, if you let him think about that for a minute, he’ll do what’s right. Every once in a while you come across an inmate acting like Hercules, but that’s very rare.”

According to ADOC’s use of force policy, officers are allowed to use physical force if a prisoner is aggressive, for self-defense, the protection of others and property, to prevent escape, quell a disturbance or “when an inmate exercises physical resistance to a lawful command.”
Wise said that last justification, when an incarcerated person disobeys a lawful command, is where some officers push the bounds of what’s legal and necessary.
“Some of them take that to say, ‘OK, well you disobeyed my command. I can whoop your ass.’ That’s not the way it’s supposed to go,” he said. “If they use proper strategy and do what they’re taught in the academy, there should be very few incidents and lawsuits.”

Repeat offenders

The largest excessive force settlement paid since 2020 was in a lawsuit filed by the mother of Steven Davis, whose son was beaten to death by a group of officers, including Roderick Gadson, who was promoted to lieutenant after Davis’ death.
An internal investigation determined the officers’ use of force was justified because they said Davis brandished two prison-made weapons and did not comply with their demands to drop the weapons. Some witnesses disputed this account, saying that officers continued to beat Davis after he dropped the weapons.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office declined to press criminal charges against the officers and the state never admitted wrongdoing. But attorneys for the officers agreed to a $250,000 settlement in August 2024.
Another case with Gadson at the center involved a beating incident in the same cell block of Donaldson prison in which Davis was killed, three months before his death. The victim, who survived, was taken to UAB hospital via ambulance with multiple injuries, including a broken leg and nose, and fractures in his hand that required surgery. Lawyers representing ADOC agreed to settle that case for $10,000.
A review of liability trust fund data and court records identified 10 officers at the center of excessive force lawsuits that settled after 2020 who are still working for the agency, according to payment records available in the Open Alabama checkbook database maintained by the Department of Finance. ADOC confirmed  employment of the 10 officers as of March 6, 2025.
Gadson is one of five officers identified in this review who was promoted after being named in an excessive force lawsuit leading to a large settlement.
Messages seeking comment on Gadson were sent to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office and Steven Herndon, an attorney who represented Gadson in the Steven Davis civil suit.
Attempts to reach Gadson directly were unsuccessful.

Accountability

David Gespass, an attorney who has represented incarcerated people in litigation against ADOC, views the agency’s excessive force problem as one in which “repeater beater” officers are not held accountable, even when these officers are sued repeatedly for harming prisoners.
“They get defended,” Gespass said. “They don’t have to pay for defense. They don’t have to pay if there’s liability found, so the problem is that ADOC just doesn’t do anything about these guys.”










They get defended. They don't have to pay for defense. They don't have to pay if there's liability found, so the problem is that ADOC just doesn't do anything about these guys.


– David Gespass, attorney


In response to the question of what actions ADOC takes when multiple excessive force lawsuits are filed against an officer, ADOC’s spokesperson Kelly Betts wrote that the agency keeps a close eye on litigation, and that “trends are monitored and discussed with the appropriate stakeholders.”
She said ADOC investigates all uses of force and if there is a question about whether the force was justified, the case is presented to a “use of force review board,” which ADOC established in 2024.
Betts wouldn’t name review board members, but said the board includes all ranks of security staff and meets “as necessary.” Consequences of the reviews follow “State Personnel’s progressive discipline guidelines” and Betts wrote that cases constituting criminal acts are handled by ADOC’s Law Enforcement Services Division and referred to the local district attorney for prosecution.
But Betts could not say how many referrals ADOC has made to prosecutors in excessive force cases. “ADOC does not currently track that data,” she wrote in response to a request for the number of cases sent to the local district attorney since 2020.

Litigation process

The 1996 federal Prison Litigation Reform Act or PLRA sought to curtail unnecessary or frivolous prison lawsuits by severely restricting the ability for prisoners to file any claim. It made it much more challenging for incarcerated people to succeed in court, and resulted in a sharp decline in lawsuits filed over prison conditions.
Still, prisons are litigious environments. Incarcerated people across the nation file civil rights complaints against officers and prison staff, but 80% of such cases filed in 2021 resulted in a pre-trial decision in favor of the defendants, according to data compiled by University of Michigan Law Professor Margo Schlanger for IncarcerationLaw.com.
A lawsuit will typically only reach settlement after passing complicated procedural requirements, and then passing a court’s scrutiny to not dismiss the case for lacking a plausible claim.
Several attorneys who have represented incarcerated Alabamaians said in the last few years, courts are dismissing fewer excessive force complaints at the preliminary stages because of the extent of the injuries, and because of video evidence from prison surveillance cameras.
Betts said settling a case is not an admission of wrongdoing.
“Cases may settle for a multitude of reasons, the most common one being the cost of continued litigation and/or trial,” Betts wrote in an email response to questions about the record number of excessive force settlements. “Often, a settlement is reached to save taxpayer money. It’s usually cheaper to settle than it is to take a case all the way to trial.”
But former ADOC Warden Wise said the record number of excessive force cases resulting in paid settlements should be a red flag to leaders in Montgomery.
“You should have enough confidence to be able to, even when there is a lawsuit, defend it, not settle it,” Wise said. “And the system needs that money, not for lawsuits, it needs that money to make it better.”

(Getty Images)Five years after medical cannabis became available in Utah after being legalized by voters, the program, while still controversial, keeps on growing. This year, the state counted over 100,000 medical cannabis card holders, a new peak in the program’s five-year existence.
Members of the Utah Patients Coalition, a plant medicine advocacy group which lobbied hard to help pass the 2018 referendum that allowed the medical cannabis program in deeply conservative Utah, see the milestone as a demonstration that the system to obtain a card is getting easier to navigate. 
Even now that a major 2025 cannabis bill has gone into effect and eliminated a system that allowed for a cheaper, more accessible way to obtain a card, the group remains hopeful for the future of medical cannabis in the state.

“The growth in 2025 has been encouraging, just because we have seen a lot of patients struggling in the past. And every year we go back to the legislative session, we go back to our platforms with education, and just try to remove some of those barriers,” Desiree Hennessy, executive director at the Utah Patients Coalition, said on Monday.
One of the 2025 general session’s routine bipartisan medical cannabis bills, sponsored by Minority Whip Jennifer Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City, and Sen. Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, went through several iterations and proposed allowing more medical cannabis pharmacies in the state. But, it didn’t make it to a vote on the Senate floor, ultimately failing. 
However, SB64, another bill sponsored by Vickers, passed, containing a provision that Utah Patients Coalition considered “a heartbreaking loss.” 
Up until this month, pharmacies were allowed to partner with clinics that have medical providers qualified to prescribe medicinal cannabis to host “card drives,” a sort of pop-up clinic in pharmacies’ parking lots in which doctors could see patients and issue cards, often at a discount. 
Those partnerships allowed cards, which are good for up to a year, to go from a regular $200 to about $75, Hennessy said.



Let us know what you think...


 


“This year, we lost the ability to allow pharmacies to do that. So now no longer can somebody write a card within 500 feet of a pharmacy unless they’re in their own business,” she said. “And so it’s really not going to hurt anybody that’s middle class or higher, but these patients struggling with finances that used these card drives.”
That was one of the last additions to Vickers’ bill. He explained on the Senate floor that the bill’s authors didn’t feel like the pop-ups were appropriate, and patients should be going to a doctor’s office for medical advice.
“If someone is a qualified medical professional, they can’t go to a pop-up tent in front of the marijuana pharmacy to give cards. We want to make sure that we are not producing a recreational environment,” SB64’s House floor sponsor, Rep. Walt Brooks, R-St George, told House members about the change.   
But, with that loss, also came some flexibility on who gets to recommend medical cannabis to a patient. Now, medical providers who are licensed to prescribe controlled substances can recommend the treatment, which according to a Department of Health and Human Services April report is mostly used to treat pain. 
According to Hennessy, that change would improve patient accessibility. 
“Patients can go to their regular care physician, hopefully not get charged any more than a co-pay, and have this medical cannabis conversation with their doctor,” she said. 
While advocates celebrate the numbers, the program remains a contentious point among Utahns, with some still protesting the annual technical bills, arguing that the state shouldn’t allow cannabis at all.
But, ultimately, Hennessy hopes that medical cannabis patients get to be treated like those receiving any other treatment. Especially, she said, since the program has been demonstrated to lower rates of opioid use and opioid-related deaths, according to a study by Management Science Associates in partnership with Dragonfly Wellness, a medical cannabis pharmacy. 
“We do believe that there’s a lot of good that can come out of using medical cannabis as a first-line drug, and not as a second or third or fourth when everything else fails,” Hennessy said, “but we could use this first and treat a lot of conditions with a lot less risk than other medications that patients are now using.”

Snow melt from the Rocky Mountains contributes about 85% of the total water flow in the Colorado River, but those flows will likely be lower than usual this summer, according to federal data. 
Across the Rocky Mountains the snow season had a strong start, then came one of the driest winters on record, followed by rapid snow melt that bodes poorly for river flow in the summer.
Mountain ranges across the Rockies didn’t reach peak snowpack in April, and only hit about 63% of average peaks. 
With less snow, runoff into Lake Powell is expected to be cut nearly in half this year, according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center. Water levels in Lake Powell, the nation’s second largest reservoir, directly impact Lake Mead because streamflow to Lake Powell is eventually released to Lake Mead.
Combined storage in Lake Powell and Lake Mead is down 920,000 acre-feet from this time last year, or enough water to supply about 1.8 million single-family homes for a year. 
 A “dreadful winter” means a high likelihood of “extreme and exceptional drought” is in store for areas of Southern Nevada, according to the Nevada Water Supply Outlook prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service.
“In 2023 it was a great runoff year with a really big snow pack. But we’re not going to see anything like that this year,” said Jeff Anderson, a USDA hydrologist and water supply specialist.
Water supply estimates for the seven Colorado River Basin states were reduced in April after rapid and early snowmelt wiped out snowpack in the region.
Rapid snow melt across Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico, pushed some basins from above-average snowpack to snow drought conditions in under a month, with snow disappearing up to four weeks early, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
“The snow pack has melted much quicker than normal,” Anderson said. “It dropped much quicker than the normal drops.”
“Oftentimes the snow packs don’t start to melt as early as they started this year. It’s like a locomotive. Once the snow pack absorbs enough energy from the sun and from the temperature and starts to melt, it’s very difficult to stop that process,” he said. 
As snowpack melts, it recharges ecosystems and replenishes reservoirs that provide drinking water for millions of people and irrigation water for millions of acres of farmland. But early melt means water leaves the region before the summer when it’s most needed. The quicker snow melts the more likely it is to evaporate too. 
Less snowmelt making its way to the Colorado River is part of a larger trend. Colorado River streamflow has shrunk by about 20% since 2000, with further declines projected due to climate change.
Stalled talks and a problematic pipeline
The seven Colorado River Basin states that depend on the river’s water are currently working on setting rules for sharing a dwindling water supply after 2026, when current operating guidelines are set to expire.
But negotiations over water allotments in the country’s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead, have stalled.
Two consecutive winters with robust snowpacks gave states that rely on the Colorado River a few more years of stability, but with a dismal water year approaching tensions appear to be growing.
Colorado River negotiators — one from each of the seven states that use Colorado River water — will not be speaking at a major water law conference in June, despite having appeared together at the conference for the last few years.
That divide has come up at the other annual appearances, too. In December, negotiators opted to split into two separate panels at the Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas after appearing together for years.
The two camps – the Upper Basin states of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, and the Lower Basin states of California, Arizona and Nevada – have been at an impasse since March after submitting two competing proposals for managing the river.
One of the biggest sticking points between the two basins is whether or not Upper Basin states should absorb mandatory water cuts during dry years, despite using significantly less than their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation year-after-year.
Historically, Lower Basin states have used nearly all their 7.5 million acre-feet Colorado River allocation under the 1922 Colorado River Compact, while Upper Basin states use about 4.5 million acre-feet annually, significantly less than their total allocation.
Lower Basin states argued all seven states should share water cuts during dry years under the new post-2026 guidelines. If they don’t, downstream states warned they could face water cuts they can’t feasibly absorb.
If the states can reach an agreement by May, then the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation can consider the proposal as part of its longer process. In the absence of a seven-state agreement on how to manage the basin’s water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation would move forward with its own management options.
Bronson Mack, a public outreach coordinator for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, said Nevada’s Colorado River negotiator, John Entsminger, is actively attending closed-door meetings and working towards compromise. However, details from those meetings have been scant.
Another fissure among states appeared after House Republicans approved a last-minute amendment to sell off nearly 11,000 acres of public land in Utah that appears to follow the pathway of the planned Lake Powell pipeline, a decades-long and highly controversial attempt by Utah to pipe water from Lake Powell.
In a joint statement, U.S. Representatives Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.) and Susie Lee (D-Nev.) said they were “alerted by Arizona and Nevada water managers that the public land to be sold in Utah could be used to develop” the controversial water pipeline from Lake Powell to Washington County, Utah.
The office of Utah Republican Rep. Celeste Maloy – who proposed the amendment – denied the allegation, as did the Washington County Water Conservancy District, which pointed to a detailed list of intended uses for the proposed land disposal, including water projects, public infrastructure, housing, recreation and an airport expansion.
That reasoning doesn’t fly with some of the state’s public land and environmental advocates, including Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network.
“There are quite a few striking similarities,” Roerink said. “We believe that this is much more than a coincidence.”
The project has yet to clear several federal hurdles, and needs a new environmental impact statement — officials in the area say the project is no longer a priority.
Roerink noted that Utah officials have also not ruled out the Lake Powell Pipeline and have continued to pursue the paper water rights that the pipeline would feed.
“This throws an even bigger wrench in a situation that is already rife with conflict, and it underscores that some states continue to believe that water exists, when in reality, we all know it doesn’t,” Roerink said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC00097-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 08:01:40.314515

She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing. Everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”

After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. It’s run by the Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.

The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.



South Carolina’s falling re-entry rate
The center does not operate a program in South Carolina, which has a recidivism rate that’s among the nation’s lowest. Fewer than 1 in 5 inmates return to prison within three years of release, according to the state Department of Corrections.
The state’s three-year return rate used to hover at roughly one-third.
Former prisons Director Bryan Stirling, who last month was sworn in as acting U.S. attorney, has recounted that when he took the helm of Corrections in 2013, people who completed their sentence were simply dropped off at the bus station in their prison uniform.
Eight years later, state officials touted being a national leader in fewer felons returning.
The rate has continued to fall since. In 2024, South Carolina’s rate remained the lowest among states that report three-year re-incarceration numbers, according to an annual report from Virginia’s prisons agency.
Officials attribute the Palmetto State’s improvement to programs that help people re-enter society. But that does not include cash payments.
Instead, the state has expanded job training and work programs in prison — which allow inmates to earn income and save for rent while still incarcerated — and partnered with community groups that help them adjust upon release. That includes lining up free transitional housing and reconnecting inmates to family.
In February, a coalition of historically Black colleges announced an expansion of a program that allows people to earn a degree while they’re incarcerated in South Carolina.
People also leave prison with a month’s supply of their prescription medications and the ability to easily get refills, which is vital for both their medical and mental health. Without their medications, they’re more likely to struggle and reoffend, said Department of Corrections spokeswoman Chrysti Shain.
While recidivism rates are reported differently by states, which can make direct comparisons misleading, South Carolina’s figures certainly show the state’s own record has improved.
Between July 2011 and June 2024, the state’s average daily prison population fell from about 22,900 inmates to 16,300, according to Corrections’ latest accountability report.

Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
 Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
‘Transformative’: More college programs are slowly coming into prisons

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals.
Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility.
In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600.
An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
 Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
How many inmates return to prison? Inconsistent reporting makes it hard to tell.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City (center) speaks to Rep. Ernie Yarbrough, R-Trinity, in the Alabama House of Representatives on April 29, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A bill that would have made it easier for parents to exempt their children from vaccine requirements failed to advance out of the Alabama Legislature this year.
SB 85, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would have allowed parents to claim religious exemptions from vaccines for their children without requiring them to state a reason. The bill would have also required public colleges and universities to provide medical and religious exemptions to vaccine or testing requirements.
But despite the bill’s failure to become law, one lawmaker said he’s committed to reintroducing the bill and feels confident it will pass in the next session.
“I plan to bring it back and continue to fight. We’re going to keep chipping away until we feel like we’ve got our liberties back,” said Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, who introduced a companion bill in the House, in a phone interview Monday.

The bill would have allowed parents or guardians to object to vaccination or testing requirements by submitting a written statement stating that the vaccination or testing conflicts with their religion as valid grounds for exemption from any school enrollment vaccine or testing requirement. It also specified that no additional forms, fees or documentation could be required of the parent, guardian or child for enrollment in any public K-12 school. The bill would have also extended these provisions to public colleges and universities.
Alabama’s measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among kindergartners was 93.8% in the 2023-2024 school year, under the 95% rate set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to achieve herd immunity. An ongoing outbreak in West Texas that started with two unvaccinated school-age children in January has now spread to at least 29 other states.
Orr said in a phone interview Friday that an amendment added by Sen. Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, which he said proponents of the bill did not like, likely kept the bill from advancing in the House. The amendment would have required a student claiming a vaccine exemption to submit a board-approved physical evaluation form or the Alabama High School Athletic Association’s Preparticipation Physical Education form, but it did not have an enforcement mechanism or sanctions for not submitting the form.
“Among the proponents, they were not happy with the Singleton amendment put on in the Senate,” Orr said. “And among the opponents, they still want to stay with the status quo, which is a bit unnecessary, in my opinion.”
Orr added that the House seemed reluctant to take up controversial bills toward the end of the session, adding that Butler would have to be asked for the specific reasons the bill didn’t make it to the House floor.
The bill passed the House Health Committee two weeks before the session ended, giving it enough time to be considered by the House, but Butler said that tension between the House and Senate toward the end of the session only allowed a number of priority bills to be passed.
“I don’t think it was a priority either. The Back-the-Blue (package) was the big priority there at the last minute, which we did get across, but we have got to do a better job of waiting until the last minute on everything,” Butler said.
Apriell Hartsfield, Kids Count director for VOICES for Alabama Children, who opposed the bill in its House committee hearing, said Monday that she was concerned about the potential impact on children’s health and safety if similar legislation becomes law in the future. 
She said that declining vaccination rates can threaten community health, potentially leading to outbreaks and increased risk for everyone. She added that fewer vaccinated people lead to a higher risk for others, especially those who are immunocompromised or too young to be fully immunized.
“Our biggest concern are the most vulnerable of the children, and those are the children who are immunocompromised, so that they cannot, medically and for health reasons, get the immunizations, and then, of course, the youngest children, those who are too young to be fully immunized,” Hartsfield said.
She said the existing process already allows parents to claim a religious exemption for required vaccines, and safeguards are in place to help public health officials address outbreaks effectively.
Butler said he was concerned about the alleged adverse effects of vaccines, particularly the COVID-19 vaccine, saying that “we’re seeing so much, so many adverse effects from mainly the COVID vaccine, and now they’re still pushing that out.” While rare adverse reactions related to the COVID-19 vaccine have been reported, such as anaphylaxis or myocarditis, the vaccine is considered safe, and these reactions are significantly less common than the severe health risks of a COVID-19 illness.
Hartsfield said that discussions on the COVID-19 vaccine and school-required immunizations shouldn’t be grouped together and that it’s essential that parents and guardians understand the decades of research behind immunizations required in schools. She said that parents can’t truly make an informed decision “if we are reducing not just the accessibility to the vaccinations, but the accessibility to the information.”
“A lot of the misinformation that’s out there, a lot of these things have been debunked over and over and again. It is the right of the parent to choose, but I think it’s important that parents know what they’re choosing, and that is where public health helps with that,” she said.
Hartsfield also pointed to the economic impact that limiting vaccine access could have on the state and communities, saying that non-immunized children exposed to measles must be out for 21 days, which could impact working families. She also said that a measles outbreak or even a single case in a child care setting, which already faces challenges, could force closures.
“Alabama is right in the middle of states that have outbreaks. We don’t have one yet, but as Dr. Scott Harris has said, it’s really not a matter of if but when this is going to happen in Alabama,” she said. 
There were 1,024 confirmed measles cases across 30 states as of May 15, according to the CDC, where 96% of individuals are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A group of judges, legislators and agency staff will explore ways to fund the state’s court system in lieu of relying on fines and fees imposed by the courts.
Members of the Court Cost Task Force convened the first meeting on Monday at the Alabama Supreme Court to review possible alternative funding streams to pay expenses for a court system that has been chronically underfunded.
“Most court costs, which you will see in just a minute, are going to non-court entities,” said Sarah Hicks Stewart, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, who presided over the meeting. “By that, I mean non-judicial branch people. The vast majority of court costs are not going to court.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Non-court entities are receiving their funding from the fines imposed by the courts that are not tied to the state’s criminal legal system, Stewart said.
The group plans to issue a report near the start of the 2026 legislative session in January outlining recommendations to the Legislature to mitigate the issues that arise when courts impose fines and fees on individuals who need access to the courts.
Courts receive a significant portion of their operational expenses from fines and fees that judges impose. But the revenues collected go to pay for programs that are not necessarily tied to the court system.
Revenues that are disbursed to agencies are also not enough to cover the full cost of operating and must rely on other sources. Fines and fees also disproportionately affect the state’s most vulnerable populations.
According to data obtained from the Alabama State Bar website, courts collected about $480 million from court fines and fees imposed by the courts. Of that, about $26.5 million went on to pay for expenses for court operations.
The majority, about $312 million or 67%, went to third parties. Some of it is in the form of restitution for criminal cases. About $160 million went to judgments while another $118 million was disbursed toward the Alabama Central Disbursement Division Child Support Unit to process child support payments. Almost $1.5 million went toward child support payments.
About $126 million are disbursed to non-court expenses, such as the General Fund budget, which receives money from sales taxes from the internet. According to the Alabama State Bar Association’s website, the General Fund budget receives almost $75 million of the fines and fees that are paid to the courts.
There are also disparities in the fines and fees that courts impose that people will pay depending on the county.
Constitution Act 96 is supposed to prohibit the Alabama Legislature from enacting any laws “regulating costs and charges of courts, or fees, commissions or allowances of public officers” to specific counties and not all the counties in the state.
But fines and fees imposed on people by courts differ depending on the county because local officials convince state lawmakers to sponsor legislation to impose additional costs that fund different programs within those counties.
“Our Legislature is very clever to figure out that if they have a local act with statewide constitutional implications, then they could trump that statewide constitutional Act 96,” Stewart said. “That is how they are all presented now, something that the state votes on as constitutional amendments, and that is how the local acts are continuing to get passed.”
An increasing number of bills get enacted that increase the filing fees which then pose problems for people who require access to the criminal justice system.
“You have got the filing fees that are collected upfront with civil filings,” Stewart said. “We have some places in which that number is so high right now that it is really becoming an access to justice issue for people who can afford to file something with that particular county.”
Collecting payments on civil filings is easier because they are imposed on the front end, before individuals may access court. A larger problem is collecting payments for criminal cases when the court orders fines and fees, as well as restitution payments shortly after a case has been adjudicated.
Brenda Ganey, the clerk of courts for Baldwin County, estimated that courts collect about 22% of the fines and fees that courts impose on defendants after they violate the law.
“To me, the low hanging fruit in all this is, how do we increase the 22% of collections, because that is money sitting there right now that, no matter what you change, no matter what you make uniform across the board, we are leaving 78% of potential money,” said Rep. Chris Blackshear, R-Smiths Station, vice chair of the House Ways and Means General Fund Committee and who attended the meeting.
J. Langford Floyd, a former judge who helped Stewart with the research, said that would be “blood out of a turnip.”
“Usually your criminal defendants are your lower income to no income people,” he said. “They are also the 20,000 that are sitting in the state penitentiary that have no way to pay it, and don’t really care about paying as long as they are in the state penitentiary.”
“If there could be some incentive for the defendant to pay what they owe, then that would make collection easier,” said Robert E. Wilters, the vice president of the Alabama District Attorneys Association.
Legislators such as Blackshear and Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, said that additional revenue options, such as raising taxes, were not an option they would consider.
“Why is it so difficult to do what is right,” Blackshear said. “And that is to not break the law. Don’t do the crime. That is the simple solution.”
The group will meet again during the summer to further discuss ideas.

Joe Lombardo had promised to veto. The bill was one of 31 declared dead Friday.
Similar to a bill vetoed by the governor two years ago, Assembly Bill 346 would have legalized the prescribing, dispensing and administering of medication designed to end the life of terminally ill patients. Lombardo in 2023 became the first governor to veto such legislation, and a day after AB346 was heard by a legislative committee last month vowed to veto it again.
Despite Lombardo’s position, the legislation did continue to move through the Legislature. The full Assembly voted on it, where it passed 23-19. The vote did not fall on party lines. It was referred to the Committee on Health and Human Services but never received a committee hearing.
Other notable bills that died Friday:

Senate Bill 143 (State Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, D) would have authorized the Joint Interim Standing Committee on Natural Resources to evaluate and review the excessive use fees and other water conservation efforts that impact turf and tree canopy. The bill passed the Senate unanimously and was heard by Assembly Natural Resources on May 5. But it was never given a committee vote.


Senate Bill 218 (State Sen. James Ohrenschall, D) would have adopted the Uniform Antitrust Pre-Merger Notification Act, requiring companies to submit to the state attorney general the same notices and information they are already required to provide federal agencies prior to mergers or acquisitions. The bill passed the Senate on party lines, with the 13 Democrats in support and the eight Republicans in opposition. It was referred to the Assembly Committee on Commerce and Labor but never given a hearing.
Assembly Bill 119 (Assemblymember Steve Yeager, D) sought to crack down on paramilitary organizing and activities. It passed the Assembly on party lines, with the 27 Democrats in support and the 15 Republicans in opposition. It was referred to the Senate Committee on Government Affairs but never given a hearing.
Assembly Bill 291 (Assemblymember Jovan Jackson, D) would have made changes to the record sealing process for people with multiple past convictions. The bill passed the full Assembly on party lines. It was given a Senate Judiciary hearing in late April but never given a committee vote.
Assembly Bill 437 (Assemblymember Jill Dickman, R) would have established a Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan, an “insurance of last resort” for properties unable to find coverage elsewhere. The bill’s death was tied to an April 23 deadline, but missed the Current’s publication time, so we’re mentioning it here. The bill made it to the floor of the Assembly but languished on the Chief Clerk’s desk and was never given a floor vote.

The future of the workshop is uncertain after lawmakers did not pass a $2.5 million appropriation to help with rebuilding (photo submitted).On the night of Dec. 17, a devastating fire swept through the Scenic River Industries sheltered workshop in Salem, throwing about 30 people out of work and upsetting recycling efforts in the area.
A temporary replacement was donated about a month later to the organization, which provides taxpayer-supported employment to people with developmental disabilities. But its capacity was severely reduced and its future was in serious doubt.
The building owned by the Dent County Disabilities Board was insured, but not enough to rebuild to modern standards, said Shawn Bolerjack, board chairman. And while the board receives about $280,000 a year from its tax levy, it can’t afford to divert money from its other services.
But Bolerjack was comforted when he learned help was on the way in the form of state funding. 
Freshman state Rep. John Hewkin, a Republican from Cuba, and veteran state Rep. Don Mayhew, a Republican from Crocker, worked to add $2.5 million to the capital improvements budget, and the money was still in the bill when the Senate approved it the morning of May 9.
But that afternoon, Republican leaders in the Missouri House refused to bring it up for a final vote, and the money was lost.
“We were surprised and disappointed to hear that they killed the bill,” Bolerjack said in an interview with The Independent.
In all, more than 60 projects added by lawmakers, in addition to more than 20 sought by Gov. Mike Kehoe, will not be funded. The list of projects included money for eight hospitals around the state, a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
Outrage over the surprise move doomed a stadium funding plan Kehoe presented to lawmakers the next week and soured relations between the House and Senate in the session’s waning days. 
But for people counting on the funding to make these local projects work, the news was devastating.
 Rep. Don Mayhew, R-Crocker, address the Missouri House on May 8, 2023 (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Two hospitals that saw promised state money disappear, including one in Salem, were counting on the funds to keep the doors open.
Hewkin and Mayhew secured $6.8 million toward a $20 million project for roof and heating system repairs, as well as other deferred maintenance, at Salem Memorial District Hospital. Without the money, Hewkin and Mayhew said the hospital will likely close.
“I’ve been poor,” Hewkin said. “You do the best you can do with what you have, and so when you do that for so long, things eventually get to a point where it’s got to be fixed, whether we have the money or not. Salem Hospital finally just got to the point where something was going to have to be done with those kinds of systems.”
Phelps Health System, which operates out of Rolla, pledged $6.5 million to the project, Mayhew said, as part of an affiliation plan announced last year. Without the state money, Mayhew said, the affiliation plan will probably be scrapped.
“They can probably stay open for a while,” he said, “but it’s a downward spiral.” 
The other hospital in danger of closing is Pemiscot Memorial Hospital in Hayti, which was in line for $1.2 million in the capital improvements budget to buy a new electronic medical records system, hospital board chair Jonna Green said.
“This money would not have simply lined our bank account,” Green said. “It would have enabled us to bill more efficiently while also reducing the chance of human error. We originally understood there was another $700,000 that was initially proposed to assist with operations, but it never made it into (the appropriation bill). We could have used it, but we were happy to receive the $1.2 million…until we didn’t.”
Both hospitals are losing money on inpatient services, according to data compiled by Saving Rural Hospitals. Pemiscot Memorial was in the black on its full range of operations, which include pharmacy services and long-term care, while Salem Memorial was not.
A new records system will mean fewer billing errors and fewer employee hours dedicated to accounting systems, Green said.
The loss of the money “won’t cause us to close, but it would in the long term,” Green said. “We can’t keep operating as we are now.” 
 Special session

Most of the time, the adjournment of the regular legislative session would mean waiting a year for another chance to influence the appropriation process. But Kehoe has already said he will call lawmakers back on a bill to spend state tax money on new and improved stadiums for the Kansas City Royals and Chiefs.
For those with projects in the construction funding bill, Kehoe held out the prospect of a lifeline that could get them the money this year.
“I’ve heard and listened to quite a few senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle on that very same issue, and I understand what their concerns are,” Kehoe said. “And I think it’s fair to say everything is on the table of what that special session might look like.”
 Andrew Ashelman fills jars with milk paint at Scenic River Industries Inc., a sheltered workshop in Salem. A fire destroyed the workshop’s facility in December and the future is uncertain after lawmakers did not pass a $2.5 million appropriation to help with rebuilding (photo submitted).
For his area, Bolerjack said, the appropriation bill is more important than incentives for sports teams.
“We’re hoping Gov. Kehoe will call a special session because there are too many important capital improvement projects in this bill to keep it waiting, including the sheltered workshop in Dent County,” he said.
The path for a stadium plan could be greased by the appropriations. Kehoe revealed his proposal to divert state tax money to stadium bond payments just two days before lawmakers went home.
It won 108 votes in the Missouri House but died in a bipartisan Senate filibuster. But Kehoe shouldn’t take the House for granted in the special session, Mayhew said.
“The governor still has a pretty tall job of selling it, regardless of what the House vote came out as,” said Mayhew, who was absent during the stadium vote. “It’s a pretty hard sell in my area for a stadium and or for any money related to a stadium.”
Another chance to get the projects funded would be a sweetener that helps get the stadium plan passed, Hewkin said.
“In my heart, I feel that there’s a possibility that we haven’t visited this for the last time, and that we still have a chance,” he said. “It’s my hope that maybe we’ll be able to get (appropriations) also in that special session.”
In the Senate, Kehoe will have to navigate both those with objections to state support for any professional sports team and those who blocked his bill because the House did not vote on the capital spending bill. And, to add another layer of difficulty, the Senate adjourned in acrimony when Republican leaders invoked the rule to shut off debate, unused since 2020, to repeal a voter-approved paid sick leave law and put an abortion ban on a statewide ballot.
One of the biggest boosters of the Chiefs and Royals, Democratic state Sen. Barbara Washington of Kansas City, said when the session ended that she could not support a stadium funding bill if the capital improvements bill is not part of a special session.
“Those things are more important to me and to my colleagues than the Chiefs,” Washington said.
State Sen. Lincoln Hough, a Springfield Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he’s not inclined to revisit the stadium proposal in a special session without a construction budget bill.
“I’m not saying the Chiefs aren’t important. I’ve been a pretty big proponent of saying we need to do what we need to do to keep them,” Hough said. “But unless it’s all included, there’s no point in it and we better have some assurances on the front end that the House isn’t going to do what the House did last time.”
During the filibuster, Hough said he was spurred to opposition in part after House Republican leaders said they spiked the appropriation bill because the overall budget spent too much, then enthusiastically backed a stadium proposal that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars..
“I don’t think there’s any point in calling a special session on anything, given the way this place is working or not working,” Hough said.
 Rural hospital losses

According to Missouri Hospital Association data, there are 12 rural hospitals in the state that have closed since 2014, with the Center for Health Care Policy and Payment reform showing nine more at immediate risk of shutting down.
The loss of each rural hospital means miles of extra driving for life-saving emergency care after injuries or medical events like heart attack or stroke. If Pemiscot Memorial closes, the closest Missouri hospital is a 45-minute drive away in Sikeston, Green said.
“We have Petersburg and Blytheville (in Arkansas), who are, say, 30 miles away,” Green said. “But the problem with that is, they don’t really like to take Missouri Medicaid and out-of-state patients.”
Bolerjack said he is concerned about the possibility Salem Memorial will close. 
“The hospital is a critical access hospital for our community and communities nearby,” he said. “It would definitely hurt us.”
The Salem hospital is an important resource when someone has an emergency while visiting tourist sites such as the Ozark Scenic Riverways, Mayhew said. There is a helipad at Akers Ferry Access, and a ground transport can be done in under 30 minutes.
“Without Salem Hospital, you’re probably a two hour ride in an ambulance,” Mayhew said.
The six other hospital projects cost a total of $12 million. They are in Clinton, Butler, Milan, Memphis, St. Joseph and Louisiana.
The bill had major state projects that were important for Kehoe as well. There was $50 million to support the University of Missouri’s project to build a new research reactor and $55 million for a new livestock display and stalling barn at the Missouri State Fairgrounds.
But it’s the small items that members were ready to showcase as examples of their ability to get things done in Jefferson City that mean the most to individual lawmakers.
“Anytime there’s cuts and things like that, sometimes it’s your ox that gets gored,” Hewkin said. “Most people don’t mind cuts, as long as it’s not their program.”
Hewkin said he has learned a lesson regardless of how the special session goes. 
While the items included in the construction budget died, 248 more legislative earmarks, costing $418 million of general revenue and $550 million overall, found a home in the $53.1 billion in spending that was approved.
So while he lost the money for Scenic River Industries, state Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin secured a $2 million grant for Handi-Shop Inc., the sheltered workshop serving Mexico in Audrain County.
That money was inserted into the Department of Education operating budget, which also includes $32 million for operating grants to the almost 90 Missouri sheltered workshops. There is $45 million in direct grants to hospitals and health care centers in the Department of Social Services budget.
“I’m hoping in my heart that there’s a chance that we still get a chance to get some of that done this year in a special session,” Hewkin said. “But if not, then next year, I’ll be standing at the appropriations door very early and asking to get my appropriation in there so we can take care of those people.”

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Spending on saving
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
‘Invertebrates are wildlife’
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

LaMonica Mciver are the Trump administration's attempt to silence its critics.,"Democrats say the charges against Rep. LaMonica Mciver are the Trump administration's attempt to silence its critics. (Courtesy of McIver's office)The Trump administration’s move to charge Rep. LaMonica McIver with assaulting law enforcement during a protest outside a migrant jail in Newark earlier this month was met with sharp criticism by Democratic lawmakers Monday.
Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08), who was with McIver at the protest, said she is owed an apology by the Trump administration.
“Every American should see this for what it is: the weaponization of the justice system in a shameful attempt to bully and intimidate those of us who stand in the way of the president’s agenda,” Menendez said.
Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12), who was also with McIver that day, called the charges “baseless.”
“This prosecution is wrong and alarming, as it is just one more example of the Trump administration ignoring the rule of law and attempting to run roughshod over the other branches of government — here, the Congress,” Watson Coleman said.
The three Democrats say they were the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, on May 9 to inspect the facilities as part of their oversight role. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was also there as part of a dayslong push to inspect the facility, which he claims opened illegally without proper city permits.
When federal agents moved to arrest Baraka, McIver and others surrounded him, and video shows she pushed past one of the agents. Baraka was arrested and charged with trespassing and released from detention later that day. When acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba announced the charges against McIver Monday, she said she was dismissing the charge against Baraka. Baraka said he expects McIver to be vindicated.
Sen. Andy Kim (D) called the charges against McIver the Trump administration’s attempt to “intimidate those who dare speak against them or expose the truth.”
“The Congresswoman was in the process of conducting oversight, which is her right and responsibility. It’s important that we stand up to protect that right, and I’m proud to join my colleagues to stand beside her to ensure that the people of our state can never be silenced,” Kim said.
Habba’s statement announcing the charges said congressional oversight is important but “not an issue in this case.” McIver assaulted, impeded, and interefered with law enforcement, Habba said, and her “conduct cannot be overlooked by the chief federal law enforement official in the State of New Jersey.”
“It is my Constitutional obligation to ensure that our federal law enforcement is protected when executing their duties,” Habba said.
It’s not clear when McIver is due in court. As of Tuesday morning, Habba’s office had not released any charging documents in the case.
The American Civil Liberties Union joined Democrats in criticizing Habba for charging McIver and demanded the charges be dropped.
“The Trump administration’s political charges against Congresswoman McIver is a method more suited for authoritarianism than American democracy. Elected officials represent the people, not the administration’s interests. They have every right to exercise their legally authorized oversight responsibilities for expanded immigration detention in New Jersey,” Mike Zamore, the group’s national director of policy and government affairs, and Amol Sinha, executive director of the ACLU of New Jersey, said in a joint statement.

LaMonica McIver with “assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement” during the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside a migrant jail in Newark 10 days ago.
Habba also announced her office is dropping Baraka’s misdemeanor trespassing charge “for the sake of moving forward.” Baraka called for federal prosecutors to dismiss the case after a court hearing in Newark on Thursday.
The stunning development has McIver accusing the Trump administration of attempting to “criminalize and deter legislative oversight” and Habba saying that congressional oversight is “not an issue in this case.”
“No one is above the law — politicians or otherwise. It is the job of this office to uphold justice impartially, regardless of who you are,” Habba said in a statement Monday evening. “Now we will let the justice system work.”
McIver, a Democrat who first joined Congress in September, said the charges are purely political.
“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. “I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”
The charges against McIver stem from a May 9 protest outside Delaney Hall, the new migrant jail in Newark. In the days prior, Baraka had attempted to gain access to the facility, which he claims is operating illegally without proper city permits.
McIver and two other New Jersey Democrats, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, joined Baraka that day, saying they wanted to inspect the jail. Members of Congress are permitted to conduct unannounced visits ofproperties by or for the Department of Homeland Security.
When federal agents moved to arrest Baraka, chaos ensued. Video shows McIver and other protestors surrounding the mayor.
While Baraka was still in federal custody that day, McIver told reporters that she was the one assaulted by federal agents.
“We did not get one apology, we did not get one explanation. I personally, who was assaulted on camera, did not get one apology from any ICE administrator, no call from Homeland Security, nothing,” she said.
Department of Homeland Security officials later posted video of the melee to social media, focusing on a moment where McIver pushes past a federal agent.
McIver said in her statement that she, Menendez, and Watson Coleman were lawfully conducting oversight of the facility and that the visit “should have been peaceful and short.”
“Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka,” she said.
Habba’s statement says she attempted to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and gave McIver “every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined.”
The three House members have faced backlash from Republican lawmakers who have introduced a resolution that would strip them of their committee assignments, and at least one representative has called for McIver to be expelled from Congress. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the three Democrats of “lawlessness.”
Habba’s statement says she has invited Baraka to tour Delaney Hall.
“The government has nothing to hide at the facility, and I will personally accompany the mayor so he can see that firsthand,” she said. “The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe.”
Habba was present in court last week for a 20-minute status conference on Baraka’s charges. Lawyers for Baraka said he was let onto the property by a staff member, and that Baraka was arrested outside the property. Monday was a deadline for federal prosecutors to deliver certain information pertaining to Baraka’s arrest.
Baraka, who is one of six Democrats running for his party’s nomination for governor, said in a statement that he is “glad” Habba has agreed to dismiss the charge he faced and said he plans to speak to her about “issues on which we can cooperate.”
“I understand that the U.S. Attorney has chosen to charge Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting law enforcement. Congresswoman McIver is a daughter of Newark, past Newark Council President, a former student of mine, and a dear friend.  I want to be clear: I stand with LaMonica, and I fully expect her to be vindicated,” he said.
Habba, a personal lawyer for President Donald Trump who became the state’s U.S. attorney in March, has targeted other New Jersey officials. Last month, she said she launched an investigation into Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin — which she called “a warning for everybody” — over a 2019 directive barring state, county, and local police from cooperating in federal immigration arrests and enforcement.

I want to speak directly to Canadians and reaffirm Vermont’s support for your country and the shared values that unite us.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Treasurer Mike Pieciak: Extending a hand to our northern neighbors.","This commentary is by Mike Pieciak, Vermont state treasurer.Let me start as directly as I can: I’m sorry, Canada. You didn’t elect our president, but you’re paying the price for his policies. In Vermont, we’re feeling the consequences too. Trump’s reckless tariffs are more than economic burdens; they’re straining relationships that have taken decades to build. They’re making life harder for communities on both sides of the border, undermining the trust and goodwill that have defined our partnership for so long. In this moment of division, I’m here to say: Vermont chooses a different path. We choose to stand with Canada.Vermonters elected me as treasurer to grow our state’s economy, lower costs and create new opportunities for financial success. For generations, our state’s deep ties to Canada have played a crucial role in this work — supporting economic partnership, lifelong friendships and trust across borders. Today, as tariffs and divisive rhetoric threaten to drive our countries apart, I want to speak directly to Canadians and reaffirm Vermont’s support for your country and the shared values that unite us. Canada is Vermont’s top trading partner, supporting billions in economic activity that benefits Canadians and Americans alike. For small businesses, our economic partnership creates unique opportunities to thrive and expand into new markets. It has helped lower costs for critical industries like housing, clean energy and maple syrup production.The Trump tariffs betray this partnership without consideration for the everyday Canadians and Vermonters who will face higher prices and less opportunity. Meanwhile, the administration’s rhetoric has undermined generations of respectful relations — damaging friendships, dividing families and making both of our countries less safe. Many Canadians have responded, understandably, by boycotting American-made products and canceling planned visits to the U.S. For Vermont’s small businesses and rural communities that rely heavily on Canadian tourism, this presents an existential challenge.Canadians have every right to feel betrayed. Here in Vermont, we share that same deep frustration as the Trump administration jeopardizes our economy and our ability to meet Vermonters’ basic needs.But let’s be clear: breaking our longstanding partnership won’t hurt President Trump or force him to change course. It will kill jobs, hurt businesses and livelihoods — making people angrier, lonelier and less trusting of the world. It will create enormous suffering for families on both sides of the border,Our relationship long predates President Trump, and I have faith that it will endure long after. The best way forward, for both of us, is to hold fast to the bonds we share. Across our state, Vermonters are doing just that — extending a hand to the Canadian people.Right now, Jay Peak Resort is welcoming Canadian visitors by accepting Canadian dollars at the same value as U.S. dollars. The Vermont Brewers Association is doing the same for their annual brewers’ festival this summer — giving Canadians more value for their money when they visit the Green Mountain State.On May 10, I traveled to Montreal with dozens of fellow Vermonters to meet with local residents and spend our money at Canadian businesses. We did this to send a simple but powerful message to Canada: You matter to Vermont. We value you. We support you. We believe in each other.Canadians and Vermonters didn’t choose this fight, but we do get to choose our friends. And in Vermont, we’re choosing to face these challenges with our neighbors to the north. We’re asking Canadians to consider choosing Vermont, too.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Treasurer Mike Pieciak: Extending a hand to our northern neighbors.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-20 07:08:18.976649

She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.

The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.

According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
Legislation and pilot programs
A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.

This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
Potential savings
In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.

Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

It is the largest hydropower producer in the U.S. and also part of the federal Columbia River Power System. (Photo courtesy of Bureau of Reclamation)Grand Coulee Dam is among the most powerful energy-generating dams on earth. It’s the bedrock of the federal Columbia River Power System — a network of 31 dams supplying more than half of the hydropower in the Northwest. Grand Coulee alone, overseen by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, generates one-quarter of that.
But critical operations at the dam are going understaffed following President Donald Trump’s orders, executed by the Office of Personnel Management, to cut probationary federal employees, freeze new hiring at federal agencies and offer incentives to get employees to retire and resign early. It’s a problem at several agencies that oversee the system, which have lost hundreds of employees and could collectively lose hundreds more by fall, and it has regional electric utilities concerned about the safety, reliability and future of the region’s power transmission.
“These are not D.C. policy-maker jobs. These are jobs on the ground, serving the people of the Pacific Northwest with clean, reliable power,” said Scott Simms, president of the Public Power Council. The nonprofit industry group represents consumer-owned utilities in six states, all of which rely on power from the Columbia River dams.
“It actually takes quite a few human beings to run these giant hydro projects on a daily basis,” Simms said. “So that is the prevailing concern in the short term: making sure that the right people are in certain jobs, and also that there’s coverage, because these are 24/7 jobs.”
 Hundreds of employees gone

The Bureau is not the only player in the basin’s energy delivery system that’s suffering. The Army Corps of Engineers, which also manages the dams, could lose more than 300 employees in the next few months, according to Tom Conning, public information officer for the Corps’ Northwestern Division. Employees of the branch had until May 1 to accept a deferred resignation and be put on paid administrative leave and have until Sept. 30 to officially resign.
The Bonneville Power Administration, or BPA, which markets and delivers the dams’ hydropower across the region, has lost 200 employees, according to recent testimony from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright at a May 7 House Committee on Appropriations budget hearing.
Cuts have cost the Bureau of Reclamation about 25% of its staff so far — around 1,400 people — according to reporting in Politico, and staffing levels at Grand Coulee Dam are about 70% of what they should be, according to Simms.
“We understand they were behind in being fully staffed as it was, and then the workforce reductions came into play,” he said of Grand Coulee.
Bureau officials did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request to either confirm or correct the figures.
“While we do not comment on personnel matters, we are committed to enhancing workforce management and are collaborating closely with the Office of Personnel Management to embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation,” Michael Coffey, a regional public affairs officer at the Department of the Interior, said in an email.
Trump’s orders, meant to cut federal spending, have not had any impact. Analyses by the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and CBS News found the Treasury’s daily spending is up billions from the same period last year.
When it comes to BPA, staff who’ve been offered incentives to resign and retire won’t make any difference. Their salaries are not taxpayer funded, but ratepayer funded, and the agency sends a profit each year to the U.S. Treasury.
Simms said 90 more BPA jobs had been rescinded as part of the federal hiring freeze, a number confirmed by a source familiar with BPA. The agency initially lost more than 100 probationary employees under a Trump executive order in February, but has since been able to bring them back.
The 290 job losses at BPA so far account for nearly 10% of the agency’s staff, and the agency is already hundreds of employees short, according to Energy Secretary Wright’s testimony.
 Hand-in-hand

All three agencies — Reclamation, Corps and BPA — collaborate to maintain and manage the Columbia River Power System.
“So they work hand-in-hand. If you don’t have reliable hydro projects, then you don’t have a stable, workable grid, right?” Simms said. “There’s craftspeople, there’s welders, there’s electricians, there’s all kinds of folks who are involved in the operation of any dam.”
The Corps is also grappling with the possibility of losing at least 325 employees in the next few months, according to Conning. That’s mostly due to resignations and early retirements.
“These reductions cut across all aspects of our operations, from senior managers, administration staff, park rangers, maintenance workers, etc.,” he said in an email. “Additionally, existing vacancies are complicating our ability to fully support various missions (like recreation).
Corps’ districts in Portland, Seattle and Walla Walla, Washington, have temporarily limited or closed some recreation areas to maintain public safety and services, he added.
Simms said the long-term concern for all of these agencies in the Northwest is not funding but having employees with the skills to preserve and improve the system. BPA and the agencies are years behind in the region as far as investing in grid expansion and connecting to new green energy projects, reporting from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica recently found.
Simms likened the predictable outcome to that of deferring maintenance on your car.
“Essentially your car is due for service and you just continue to ignore the warning light. You’re going to pay the consequences if you continue to ignore that warning light,” he said. “That is what we’re worried about in the longer term: making sure that we’ve got the right people to do the needed work. It’s not a money problem, it’s actually a people problem.”
Simms said the Public Power Council has been working with both sides of the aisle in both chambers of Congress to advocate for more investment in the region’s hydropower system and its employees.
At the May 7 Congressional budget hearing, Energy Secretary Wright said he was aware BPA’s staffing could not go lower.
“I don’t think we have room to reduce headcount there anymore,” he said. “There’ll be no more shrinkage in head count at Bonneville Power.”
Simms said federal leaders likely need to go further.
“I think we’re going to have to get our heads around the idea of probably paying incentive payments and retention payments the way we’ve seen at the FAA for air traffic controllers, the way we’ve seen it for the USDA for food inspectors, the way we’ve seen it at the Forest Service for fire mitigation personnel,” he said. “I think we’re going to be in a place where we’re going to have to use those kinds of tools to attract and retain the people that we need for these critical positions.”

In June 2021, Connie Kathary asked her mom to go on a walk. Though she knew she’d be accepted, it took the then 14-year-old more than 20 minutes to work up the courage to tell her mom that she’s transgender. She still laughs at the significance of choosing Pride Month for the conversation.

“I walked her outside. We were just talking about stuff, and I told her, ‘Yep, I’m a girl.’ And she was very accepting,” Connie said. With a laugh, she added, “At first, I was a bit upset, because she didn’t give me, like, the fanfare, because I’ve always been a real attention whore.”

Since then, Connie has had to overcome the legal complexities of changing her name and the search for medical providers who could offer her the treatment she needed. Finding treatment took more than a year. And then, three months after her treatment started, Connie had to contend with a new challenge — an Indiana state law banning minors from receiving gender-affirming health care.

As she and her family scrambled for solutions, Connie, like many other transgender youth under 18, found help across the border in Illinois.

Indiana is among 26 states — many in the Midwest and South — that have outlawed youth gender-affirming care statewide since 2021. In Illinois, political leaders have moved in the opposite direction.

Gov. JB Pritzker signed the Patient and Provider Protection Act into law in 2023, after lawmakers passed it following the overturning of Roe v. Wade; it solidified access to abortion and gender-affirming care in Illinois and protects physicians who treat out-of-state youth like Connie.

Today, Illinois lawmakers and advocates say that law is more important than ever. In addition to states passing increasingly strict bans on gender-affirming care, Donald Trump, in his second term as president, is advancing numerous federal policies affecting transgender people. This includes executive orders seeking to prohibit transgender women from competing in women’s sports and ban the use of federal funding on gender-affirming treatment for individuals under 19.

A judge has temporarily blocked the order banning the use of federal funds on gender-affirming care, and Illinois state Rep. Kelly Cassidy, a chief sponsor of Illinois’ shield law, said the Trump directive has not impacted access to care in Illinois. “I think that’s the most important thing people need to know: His signature on that paper changed nothing (in) regard to access to care in Illinois today or tomorrow,” she said.

Cassidy said Illinois’ law is among the strongest in the country, though it hasn’t been tested. She said lawmakers are “bracing for that, but we’re bracing for it with a solid litigation strategy and the belief that we can slow the harms, we can minimize the harms.”

In the two years since the law’s passage, Illinois has become a critical refuge for transgender youth, providers and families say. Planned Parenthood of Illinois said around 7% of their gender-affirming patients come from out of state – an increase since nearby states have restricted care – seeking estrogen and testosterone therapy, a treatment for gender dysphoria. As defined by Mayo Clinic, gender dysphoria is “a feeling of distress that can happen when a person's gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth.” Complications include discrimination, difficulty maintaining relationships and mental health concerns such as anxiety, depression and self-harm.

In Indiana, Connie would have had to wait four years — until she turned 18 — to start gender-affirming care, a treatment that experts say can ease depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts in transgender youth.

“If I didn’t transition, I’m not even sure I would still be here,” Connie said. “There is probably a universe out there where I didn’t transition, which, I don’t want to think about it, but that’s the thing — you have to.”

Starting the journey

With her mom, Julia, and her dad, Greg, in her corner, Connie took the first steps in her transition journey: changing her name and gender in the legal system. While the school responded quickly to Julia’s request, the full legal process took over a year.

In the months before the court hearing, Connie elected to start attending therapy. It wasn’t required, Julia said, but it helped the legal process run smoother. “Sometimes a county that may not be as accepting as (our) county is, the judge might ask for a letter from a therapist,” she said. “Kind of like, ‘Prove to me that you’re not just changing anything for the heck of it’ or whatever. People do think that. They think … that you just get on a whim.”

It was after her name was changed in the legal system that Connie decided to pursue gender-affirming hormone therapy. She recalls facing a lot of skepticism during this time.

“You have to go through a few different doctors, where they can be like, ‘Are you sure?’ ‘Are you sure you’re sure?’ ‘Are you sure?’ ‘You sure?’” she said.

While a statewide ban was not in place at the time, Connie still faced limited options. Julia said that Connie’s pediatrician – albeit supportive – could not prescribe medications due to the hospital’s Catholic policies. She was referred to Riley Children’s Hospital in Indianapolis, where she spent a year waiting for an appointment. When the time finally came, she was able to receive medication — a feminizing hormone therapy of spironolactone and estrogen — the same day.

“It’s really about the bureaucratic hoops you have to jump through, because it could really be so easy,” Connie said. “I’m not saying it should be ‘say it and then immediately get a prescription’ … I’m just saying it shouldn’t be that hard.”

In 2023, Indiana Republicans were at the forefront of a national move to restrict transgender rights. Hundreds of protesters, including the Katharys, jammed the Indiana Statehouse when a state House committee considered Senate Bill 480, a law prohibiting gender transition procedures and treatments for children, even if the patient’s parents approve of the treatment.

The bill passed committee on an 8-5 vote three months after Connie began treatment. The primary sponsor of the legislation, Republican Sen. Tyler Johnson, said in a statement that the measure would protect “vulnerable Hoosier children.” Johnson, an emergency physician from northeast Indiana, said he had “compassion” for children experiencing gender dysphoria and said they deserved counseling, but he questioned the need for medical treatment.

“Since these procedures have irreversible and life-altering effects,” he said, “it is appropriate and necessary for our state to make sure these procedures are performed only on adults who can make the decisions on their own behalf.”

Despite more Statehouse protests, Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb signed the law in April 2023. The ACLU of Indiana sued almost immediately, leaving Connie and her family to anxiously await updates.

The initial news was promising. In June 2023, a judge issued a temporary injunction that blocked the law from taking effect, giving them a brief sense of relief. But in February 2024, a panel of the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals lifted the injunction, and the Katharys received a heartbreaking email from the ACLU notifying them that “care can no longer be provided in Indiana.” Initially, a grandfather clause left those receiving treatment with six months to continue treatment, but when the injunction was lifted, so was the clause.

With Connie running low on medication, Julia said she immediately signed her up on Planned Parenthood of Illinois’ online patient portal.

Crossing state lines

One month later, Julia and Greg called off work, signed Connie out of school, and drove from Indianapolis to Flossmoor, Illinois, a suburb 30 minutes south of Chicago. Connie spent the 170-mile car ride watching a season of “Invincible” and wishing for a visit to Six Flags.

“I think the thing that makes me mad about the whole thing is, like, as a taxpayer in Indiana — me and Greg both — we pay our taxes here in Indiana, we work here in Indiana,” Julia said. “We were told we can’t parent our child and make health care decisions for her without driving outside the state.”

Despite frustration, they said they made sure to enjoy themselves on the trip.

“Besides the fact that I really should not have had to do that, it was a really fun day in my mind,” Connie said. “The part of me that has to think about this stuff is like, ‘I shouldn’t have had to do that.’ Then the part of me that just wants to be a kid is like, ‘Yeah, no school, driving up to Chicago, all right!’”

Illinois’ political leaders have worked for years to make the state a friendly destination for transgender patients. Cassidy, a Chicago Democrat, has been on the forefront of those efforts. She is a long-term advocate for LGBTQ+ and reproductive rights. Her partner is nonbinary. She’s the only openly gay member of her chamber. These experiences made becoming the chief sponsor for Illinois’ shield law a fight she was not going to back away from, she said.

Cassidy said the legislation ensures there is Medicaid coverage of gender-affirming care, prevents Illinois from participating in investigations when other states seek to penalize those who are traveling to access health care, and protects the Illinois licensure of medical professionals who are dually licensed.

Edwin Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for the ACLU of Illinois, said it was “designed to ensure that no one who is providing lawful health care in Illinois is subject to punishment as a result of having provided that care.”

“As we see, other states not only implement these bans but then also try to enforce their bans from their state in Illinois,” Yohnka said.

Cassidy feels it’s important that decisions impacting bodily autonomy are made without governmental interference.

“Ultimately, I have never had a lawmaker question whether I needed my two heart surgeries,” she said. “They saved my life, and so did my abortion, but I’ve had to justify that.”

Local protections

Protections for transgender patients extend to the local level in Illinois, too. In the small college town of Carbondale, a bodily autonomy ordinance protects autonomous medical decisions, including gender-affirming care.

“It’s expressly written … that anyone in the city of Carbondale who is caught working with some law enforcement agency attempting to extradite someone for coming here to exercise their right to health care, they'll be held liable,” Carbondale City Councilmember Clare Killman said. “The individual who is cooperating with an outside law enforcement agency will be held liable. And no member of Carbondale city staff, Carbondale Police Department included, is authorized to comply with, say, an extradition order.”

Killman is the first openly transgender person to be elected to a city council in Illinois. As a teen growing up in Missouri, Killman said she wasn’t accepted and was forced into conversion therapy. At 17, she fled what she called a “dire situation” and moved to Carbondale. Today, she considers herself an “interstate refugee.”

“It's not like I can come here and be declared a refugee and seek asylum, but Carbondale essentially did that for me, where they opened their arms and they integrated me, and I was able to build a life here,” she said.

Like Cassidy, Killman questions whether state and federal authorities should be able to override an individual’s medical care decisions. She praises Illinois for deferring that right to the individual, regardless of what is being done at the national level.

They’re supposed to.” (Capitol News Illinois photo by Carly Gist for the Saluki Local Reporting Lab)[/caption]

“Illinois affirms your right to own your body, and so instead of kicking something back to the states, instead of the federal government mandating one way or the other, Illinois is giving people the choice,” she said. “They're not sending it back to themselves to regulate. They're giving a choice to people.”

Mallory Klocke, director of gender-affirming hormone therapy at Planned Parenthood of Illinois, said the organization has seen an increase of transgender youth traveling from out of state.

“As a program director, I review all the records of people who have already initiated care and are transferring their care to us,” Klocke said. “So I’ve definitely seen lots of people coming in from Indiana (and) people as far as Texas or Florida.”

From 2017 through 2021, 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 in the U.S. were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to a research analysis by Reuters Investigates and Komodo Health Inc. That’s less than 0.1% of the nation’s total population, yet the majority of states in the Midwest and South have passed laws banning medical practice for transgender youth in recent years, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an independent, nonprofit think tank.

To Charles Kolesar, a clinical director at CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, open access in Illinois is crucial. CHOICES, which offers gender-affirming care to transgender people ages 16 and up, opened in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1974 and expanded to Carbondale in 2022.

For older adolescents, the Carbondale clinic is now their only option. Tennessee banned health care workers from providing hormones, puberty blockers and other treatments to trans youth in 2023 with the passage of Senate Bill 1, which is currently being challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court. 

“For whatever reason, places like Tennessee, it’s like their top agenda is to shut down gender-affirming care,” Kolesar said. “I mean, it’s a bizarre fixation, but yeah, I think it’s critical for places like Illinois to have the access so people can receive the care they need.”

No easy feat

While Connie was able to travel to Illinois for care, she knows not every young person in Indiana comes from a family that is supportive of their desire to transition, or has the means to travel out of state. She worries about what it means for them.

“A majority of my family is accepting and they love me, but not all people have that,” Connie said. “And the way that this (Indiana) law is made, there’s going to be blood on their hands — there’s probably already — and I think they’re evil for that.”

For many families, traveling out of state is no easy feat. Connie and her family have had to drive six-plus hours roundtrip for doctors’ appointments and rely on a network of friends and family to pick up her prescriptions from Illinois pharmacies.

Nadine McSpadden, director of advocacy and general counsel at IYG, a nonprofit organization that serves LGBTQ+ youth in Indiana, said traveling for care requires many expenses.

“You have to have a working vehicle. You have to be able to pay the gas money. You have to be able to take time off of work. You have to be able to take your child out of school. You might have to drive far enough that you have to pay for a hotel overnight, and then, of course, there’s potentially an insurance issue. Are you insured at all? If you are insured, is your insurance going to cover this out-of-state provider and whatever treatment it is you’re going to be receiving? … So it’s becoming a very cost-prohibitive exercise for a lot of these families to provide what is truly life-saving care for their kids,” she said.

The visits can also be frequent. Kolesar said patients at CHOICES come in around every three months when they first start receiving care.

“When you initiate hormone therapy, people have to have lab work,” he said. “They have to be monitored typically for liver, kidney function, that kind of stuff. … So it’s a big commitment for parents to have to follow through and support their child that way, especially when they’re having to travel and all the expense of traveling and taking time off work and that kind of thing.”

According to McSpadden, the bans have much more than just a financial impact.

“It’s hard to even describe how emotionally taxing it is for these youth and their families to feel like your own state government has such low value and esteem for your well-being that they would make it this hard for you to get the basic medical care that you need to just live your life,” McSpadden said. “Youth feel scared and isolated and stigmatized, and their parents feel, I think, a little bit panicked about how they’re going to be able to continue caring for their kids in the way that they feel like they need to as parents, because it’s becoming so challenging in so many ways.”

A recent study published in Nature Human Behavior found that anti-transgender state laws led to an increase of suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth. The study, which surveyed 61,000 transgender and nonbinary youth and controlled variables such as state differences, race and age, found that suicide attempt rates increased by up to 72% among those age 13 to 17 living in states with anti-trans bans compared to those without.

“For a lot of trans and nonbinary people, being on hormone therapy is part of how they’re able to feel good in life,” Klocke, the Planned Parenthood of Illinois director, said. “Sometimes, if people have, like, medical conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes or things like that, if people feel more at home in their bodies, they’re able to manage their other medical conditions more easily and with more confidence than they might otherwise. And so stopping those hormones for young people risks people’s well-being, and oftentimes, it can risk their lives. And that’s something that we have seen time and time again.”

Connie received gender-affirming hormone therapy for around a year before Indiana outlawed it. Klocke said if patients abruptly stop receiving treatment, it can be “really, really rough.”

“When you change your hormone levels, that can be challenging,” they said. “Ask anybody who has gone through puberty if hormonal shifts affect their mood, and they will probably tell you yes. And when that’s not an active choice by a person, that can be even harder.”

A glimpse forward

Connie turned 18 in December, a critical milestone for her since the Indiana ban on transgender care is specific to minors.

“I mean, I’m glad I don’t have to go to Illinois anymore for my meds,” she said from her home in Indianapolis.

But the days of traveling to Illinois aren’t in the rear-view mirror just yet. While Connie is now able to retrieve prescriptions from Indiana pharmacies, Julia said they did not feel it was safe to switch her care back to Indiana. Trump’s rhetoric and the changing policies at the state and federal level toward transgender people still loom large. But Connie is still a senior in high school, and like anyone else at that age, she’s thinking about her own future.

At the end of the month, she’ll don a cap and gown and graduate. Senioritis hasn’t been easy, she said, but she’s looking forward to starting the next chapter of her life. She’s proud to be open and give her voice to this cause, but she longs for a day that she’ll be interviewed for more than just her gender identity — perhaps for her creative writing skills, which she plans to study in college.

“I really don’t think I should have to be a model or like a symbol,” she said. “I don’t want to be that. I just want to, you know, live my life.”

Emergency services calls skyrocketed, and health outcomes deteriorated.
Trey Caldwell, the area’s Republican state representative, said his office found at least three people died after long ambulance rides. “They would have survived,” he said, “if they could have gotten immediate emergency care right then and there.”
But hope for the community dotted with dairy farms arrived in 2023, when construction started on a new hospital. Breaking ground required state and federal law changes, funding from former President Joe Biden’s administration and, perhaps most importantly, seed money from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Development agency.
“The last thing you want to do is saddle that hospital with a lot of debt,” Caldwell said. “That USDA funding mechanism was massive. It really helped move the needle.”
But former agency officials worry fewer projects like the hospital could be built in rural America as the Trump administration and Elon Musk’s DOGE have targeted Rural Development for large staffing cuts.
With fewer employees in rural communities assisting local leaders with their funding needs, there is concern Trump’s chainsawing of the federal workforce could leave rural America without a robust safety net.
“We invest in so many businesses in rural America, and when you have fewer businesses, you have fewer jobs and fewer economic opportunities,” said Basil Gooden, who led Rural Development during Biden’s last year in office. “It’s not going to happen overnight. It’s going to take a little while before people realize things have really broken.”
In a statement, the USDA said Biden officials left the USDA “in complete disarray, including hiring thousands of employees with no sustainable way to pay them. … Fortunately, President Trump is taking strong action to support farmers.”
Rural Development is how the federal government ensures rural areas aren’t left behind as those residents move to cities for higher living standards. It funds broadband infrastructure and helps lifelong renters buy homes in population-losing communities.
Former agency officials said keeping rural areas attractive is essential to national security. Consumers have grown accustomed to the convenience of fully stocked grocery store shelves and freezers, and the country’s fuel supply increasingly uses ethanol grown in Midwestern corn fields. To keep the supply chain running, some people have to live in areas often bereft of modern-day necessities, such as hospitals or high-speed internet.
Investing in rural communities is critical to ensure a long-term agricultural workforce, especially as the average age of U.S. farmers increases rapidly. That means the people growing America’s food and fuel need access to quality grocery stores, childcare and health care.
“Farming ranks among the most hazardous occupations, making access to emergency medical services and hospitals a critical infrastructure need,” said Bette Brand, who led the agency during Trump’s first term. “Ensuring that rural families can live and work safely is fundamental to maintaining a stable food supply and sustaining agricultural productivity.”
The number of projects Rural Development has funded each year has trended downward for years, but it began to nosedive in 2021, agency data shows. Biden officials pointed to the loss of about 2,000 agency employees, out of a total of about 6,000, during the first Trump administration.
“Our investments have gone down because we just don’t have the staffing that we used to have,” Gooden said. “We don’t have the people on the ground. That’s very detrimental.”
Gooden hired about 800 more staffers during his tenure, he said, but they were probationary employees, the classification the administration has targeted for dismissal. More than 500 of the employees were let go in the administration’s mass terminations at the USDA in February.
To date, more than 1,500 Rural Development staffers have left, the USDA said — likely leaving the agency with fewer staffers than at the end of the first Trump administration. That’s roughly 10% of the 15,000 total USDA employees who have left the department.
Brand said the agency made meaningful gains in efficiency in Donald Trump’s first term. Continuing to improve efficiency, DOGE’s stated goal, is important, she said, but the recent job cuts risk destabilizing rural communities, which have largely supported Trump’s candidacies.
“There’s a persistent undercurrent of stress among federal employees that’s slowing the pace of loans and program implementation,” she said. “That doesn’t mean change isn’t needed, but the way it’s executed matters.”



She likened the agency to an ocean liner that’s left port. “It’s as if the agency is mid-voyage — charting a course and making progress — and someone dropped anchor without warning,” she said. “You don’t stop a ship of that size without consequences. The abruptness disrupts momentum, strands key personnel and risks throwing off balance the very systems rural communities rely on. Reform is necessary, but if the process causes collateral damage to people who are simply doing their jobs, it could create long-term harm.”



Brand added reforms must produce lasting results to justify the disruption.
“If you’re going to put the agency — and the communities it serves — through this kind of turbulence, the outcomes better be meaningful and durable,” she said. “Otherwise, the cost to individuals and local economies may never be recouped.”
In an early March speech, Brooke Rollins, Trump’s agriculture secretary, announced she would release a plan to restore rural prosperity in the “coming weeks.” No plan has been released yet, but she said it would improve the agency’s efficiency.
On Trump’s 100th day, Rollins released her own list of accomplishments, which included taking “leadership to make rural America prosper again.” It linked to her previous statement about her unreleased plan. In a statement to Investigate Midwest, the USDA said “more information … will be released soon.”
Rollins also said the USDA would “invite the private sector” to participate in the endeavor, and she specifically mentioned satellite internet. Musk owns Starlink, which provides satellite internet. The White House has said Musk has pledged to avoid potential conflicts of interest, according to NBC News.
Across the country, only 55% of farms have broadband access, and Starlink has been pushed as an alternative in rural areas because it relies on satellites instead of traditional cable infrastructure. But the federal official who led the government’s broadband program pilloried Starlink in a resignation letter in March, according to Politico.
“Stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world’s richest man even richer is yet another in a long line of betrayals by Washington,” the official, Evan Feinman, wrote.
Asked if the USDA saw a conflict of interest in Rollins pushing satellite internet, the department did not answer directly. It said its programs are “technology neutral” and it will allow communities to decide what technology “is best for their project.”
In her March speech, Rollins added her plan will “restore more power to … local leaders who know (their) communities better than anyone in Washington.”
It’s unclear how Rollins’ plan differs from Rural Development’s existing role. The agency was designed to spur private investment in underserved areas, with the USDA acting as a lender of last resort that cannot compete with banks. Former officials said local communities largely drive what projects are funded.
The federal employees working in state Rural Development offices are also members of the communities in which they operate.
For instance, in South Dakota, local developers have received grants to update rural water systems. “It’s South Dakotans doing the work, and it’s South Dakotans who care about making sure that they’ve got clean water for their community,” said Nikki Gronli, a Biden political appointee who led the agency’s state office.
“We are a place that is often forgotten,” she added. “I think the best people to do the work here are South Dakotans because they care. It’s personal for them. I don’t see some large developer coming from Chicago or L.A. that’s going to want to invest in South Dakota with our small population.”
Out of 39 people in the South Dakota office, nine were fired in February and a few others have accepted retirement offers, Gronli said. In a matter of months, the office has been reduced to 26 staffers.
USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins speaks during a roundtable at the agency’s headquarters on May 7, 2025, in Washington D.C. (Tom Witham/USDA.
Recently, Rollins said federal workers who assist farmers with direct loans would not be terminated, according to the North Dakota Monitor. Employees with the Farm Service Agency, a separate USDA division from Rural Development, or those on the “frontline or with the farmers” would be spared, she said.
When asked if Rural Development was included in the definition of “front line,” given its importance to farmers’ lives, the USDA pointed to an April 22 declaration in which Rollins exempted “national security and public safety” positions from the hiring freeze.
“As the memo states, ‘Food Security is National Security,’ and Secretary Rollins will not compromise this critical work,” the USDA said in a statement.
The memo lists dozens of positions that are exempted, including firefighters and food inspectors. None are related to Rural Development.
 First Trump administration instituted agency cuts

Trump has often declared his love for farmers and rural communities, but, like now, his first administration targeted Rural Development for job cuts.
Months into the first Trump administration, then-Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue proposed restructuring the USDA, including abolishing the undersecretary for Rural Development position.
In the USDA hierarchy, an undersecretary is just below the department’s top leader. Several undersecretary positions exist, and they can be seen as commitments to important aspects of the USDA’s mission. Undersecretaries oversee farm production, food safety and natural resources, for example.
Perdue established an undersecretary of international trade, a priority of the first Trump administration. At the time, advocates worried the move signaled less investment in rural America.
The administration’s hiring freeze, implemented in January 2017, also affected Rural Development, and the agency reduced headcount by consolidating administrative duties, such as human resources.
Leadership at the agency turned over a few times before Brand was tapped to head it in early 2020, right before the COVID-19 pandemic started. “That leadership transition made it difficult for us to stay on target on some of these bigger priorities,” she said.
In her new role, Brand fielded complaints from state offices. “You would hear it quite often from states that said, ‘Well, I need more people. I need more help,’” she said. “But the real question was whether the issue was staffing levels or whether better technology and systems could help existing staff be more effective.”
She said modernizing operations was key to meeting demands. In her opinion, if IT systems were stronger, field staff could spend more time in the field.
When the pandemic forced the department to work remotely, Brand, who worked for decades in the farm credit industry, worried about customer service, but, she said, “our customers didn’t notice a difference.”
Although Trump and Musk have alleged that many federal employees are lazy, Brand had the opposite experience during Trump’s first term. During the pandemic, one employee in a rural area did not have high-speed internet at his house. However, he could connect to broadband at the end of his long driveway. He built a shack there so he could work remotely, Brand said.
 Trump actions reverse Biden staffing additions

When Biden officials took over the agency, they heard a similar complaint as Brand: “One of the things I heard right away from one of our veteran employees was we need more people,” said Gronli, South Dakota’s former state director.
As the pandemic still raged, Robert Lyons, a political appointee in Washington, joined the USDA’s office in late 2021. Following the previous administration’s reduction in staff, “there were less people doing more work,” he said. “Everyone was rolling up their sleeves and doing what felt like two to three jobs.”
Many employees did not document their overtime, Lyons said. “We had to tell them, ‘Hey, we need Congress to understand that when they allocate funding, this is the amount of work that’s actually going into processing these grants and meeting with the community,’ ” he said.
Fewer staffers, especially at the state level, could translate into frustrating experiences on the ground.
Bert Cunningham, the city manager of Bowie, a town of about 6,000 in north Texas, said he recently applied for a grant to extend a waterline. He had little personal interaction with agency employees, which delayed the process as he tried to navigate the agency’s website. “It’s all email with Rural Development,” he said.
The attractive part is that the USDA offers better terms than banks or other lenders, Cunningham said. It could forgive up to 40% of a loan, he said.
Eventually, Cunningham found an engineering firm that frequently works with the USDA. He said that approach has been more successful.
In the last year of Biden’s presidency, the agency pushed to hire more workers in state offices. Many of them were younger workers who, the thought was, would become the next generation of Rural Development leaders as USDA’s older workers naturally retired.

After Trump was elected, members of his transition team asked Rural Development leaders questions focused on its workforce: How many worked remotely? Where were they located? In the opinion of Gooden, Biden’s last head of Rural Development, the questions were not focused on the agency’s mission.
“That was surprising to me,” he said. “Whenever I go into an organization, I want to know what keeps folks up at night.”
Soon after inauguration day, Trump officials illegally placed a freeze on funding that Congress, the branch of government that controls America’s purse strings, had appropriated. The flow of Rural Development funding stopped.
As payments to farms stopped, state offices had little information to share. In response to the rejection of a reimbursement payment for a Maryland farm in early February, a Rural Development staffer said, “We will need to wait and see if the hold will be lifted, for now we cannot process the reimbursement,” according to records submitted in a lawsuit against Trump’s funding freeze.
On April 15, a judge ruled the USDA’s freeze was illegal and ordered funding to resume. At a May 7 Congressional hearing, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said funding for several programs, including for broadband, were still frozen. Rollins did not dispute it.
She said the USDA was complying with court orders and funding for many programs would be made available by the end of May.
 Proposed cuts to Medicaid could imperil new hospital

Oklahoma has long struggled with health care access. By 2020, Oklahoma had the second-highest uninsured rate in the country, according to Oklahoma Watch, and Tillman County had one of the highest uninsured rates in the state. About 18% of its several thousand residents had no insurance.
The first step, then, in bringing a new hospital to the area was Oklahoma’s expansion of Medicaid access. In June 2020, voters approved a ballot initiative that increased how much a family could make and still be eligible for the program. Since 2021, an additional 330,000 people have received benefits, according to the state.
Expanding Medicaid was a “godsend” for rural hospitals, said Rich Rasmussen, the Oklahoma Hospital Association’s president. It opened up a new revenue stream, as the state now reimburses hospitals for care at a level closer to private insurance. “Medicaid has the ability to close the gap for these rural hospitals,” he said.
But another obstacle presented itself at the federal level, said Caldwell, the Oklahoma state representative.
Because facilities in rural areas primarily serve small populations with many low-income and senior patients, they often require federal grants to remain operable. To qualify for the funding, the facilities must be designated as “critical access hospitals.” They need to provide 24/7 emergency care. They also need to be at least 35 miles from another critical access hospital.
The hospital’s location was too close — by several hundred feet, Caldwell said.
“We started looking at all the loopholes about the road requirements,” he said. “We started putting together a plan.”
He lobbied James Lankford, Oklahoma’s Republican U.S. Senator, who began pushing for a rule change, Caldwell said. Chuck Schumer, the current Senate minority leader for the Democrats, also advocated for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to loosen its rules, as rural New York hospitals had faced similar problems, according to his office.
In 2022, CMS clarified the distance requirement for critical access hospitals. Originally, hospitals needed to be at least 35 miles apart via a “primary road.” The definition was narrowed down to be more specific, which allowed the future hospital in Tillman County to be eligible for federal funding.
At the same time, revenue streams to build the hospital were secured.
Caldwell and a few other state representatives shepherded legislation that increased funding for rural hospitals. Money from the American Rescue Plan Act, a Biden economic stimulus to address the COVID-19 pandemic, was also tapped.
U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican that represents Tillman County and chairs the powerful appropriations committee, wrangled $6 million for the $15 million project from Rural Development. The agency’s state lead, Ken Corn, a Biden appointee and a former state senator, was also a “huge help,” Caldwell said. Corn declined to comment.
Cole said the state Rural Development office was instrumental in jumpstarting the hospital.
“I’m hardly an advocate for the Biden administration,” he said, “but the local people that we had working in the ag department were critical to this. Oklahoma is not an area that Joe Biden was going to do particularly well in, and yet the USDA stepped up.”
Caldwell said it’s his understanding the hospital’s construction has not been affected by the Trump administration’s funding freeze. Comanche County Memorial Hospital, which will run the new Tillman County facility, said the project “remains fully supported.”
But another Trump initiative could affect the hospital’s long-term viability.
Trump has advocated for slicing Medicaid funding to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. On Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson released the GOP’s tax plan, which includes Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated 8.6 million people would lose health care under the proposal, according to the Associated Press.
If Medicaid is slashed, that would erase a significant income source for all hospitals, impact their financial sustainability and scuttle any new projects under development, Rasmussen said. Not only would health care access suffer, but local communities would lose many jobs, further hurting their economies.
“These small hospitals would not be able to survive without that program,” he said.
Asked about cutting Medicaid, Caldwell, who chairs the state’s appropriations committee, said it was a significant concern because the state would face a budget shortfall.
Medicaid access is “in our state constitution,” he said. “If the feds pull back, we will be legally obligated to make it whole. We’ll have to find cuts in other spots of the budget.”
Speaking before the GOP’s budget was released Monday, Cole said reining in government spending was necessary to deal with the government’s budget deficit. The potential effect on the Tillman County hospital “depends on how the cuts are done,” he said.
“Everybody worries about” cuts to Medicaid, Cole said, “but this gets down to focusing on things that are essential, and I’m comfortable that that’s what we’ll do.”
Comanche, the hospital, said Medicaid cuts would have a “minimal” effect. “A significant portion of Tillman County’s population is eligible for Medicare, which is reimbursed under a different structure,” a spokeswoman said. “As a result, the hospital’s financial outlook remains stable.”
While Congress debates Medicaid cuts — and the potential fate of the Tillman County hospital — Caldwell takes pride in the work he and others did to revive a hospital. He drove by it recently, and the construction “warmed my heart,” he said.
“It’s going to save people’s lives,” he said. “There are going to be people over the next 50 years who get to spend extra time with their loved ones because that hospital is there.”

North Carolina’s gun violence crisis continues to grow more dire by the day. According to the most recent data, someone dies in our state from a gunshot wound every five hours. Think about that for a minute: that’s more than four lives lost every day.
Amazingly, however, state legislative leaders are determined to pour more gasoline on the fire.
As the latter days of the 2025 session approach, four bills on the fast track would make it even easier than it already is for just about anyone to carry a hidden, loaded weapon.
Two would allow concealed weapons in private schools. Another would make concealed carry permits good for the rest of the owner’s life. And another would allow anyone 18 or older to carry without a permit.
The bottom line: As a group of community leaders made clear last week in an event organized by North Carolinians Against Gun Violence, these bills are a recipe for even more deadly mayhem. It’s essential that lawmakers stop, listen to their constituents, and find an offramp from the dangerous road they’re headed down.

(Courtesy of Nathan Hill)A program that lets Idaho parents and spouses serve as paid caregivers is set to end in two months.
The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, last week approved the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s request to end Idaho’s program.
The program, called the Family and Personal Care Services program, allows spouses and parents to be paid caregivers for their family members with disabilities. Nearly 1,200 Idaho children were enrolled in the program in October, a number that has spiked in recent years. 
‘That impossible juggle:’ How Idaho parents of disabled kids are bracing for care program’s end

The program was federally approved during the pandemic as a way to reduce COVID’s spread and address a shortage in the typical disability caregiver workforce. In November, Idaho health officials announced plans to seek to end the program, saying fraud and abuse contributed to higher program costs and enrollment levels, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Last month, CMS temporarily extended Idaho’s program, which was set to expire in March. 
Disability advocates and families who participate in the family caregiver program worry kids with disabilities couldn’t get the care services they need without the program, the Sun previously reported. Idaho has a shortage of direct care workers, the typical caregivers that work in relatively low-paid, demanding jobs, according to a watchdog report by the Idaho Office of Performance Evaluations.

 CMS gave Idaho two months to end the program

In a letter on May 15, CMS approved Idaho’s request to end the family caregiver program within 60 days. After that, Idaho will no longer have the power to pay spouses and parents as disability caregivers.

But broader caregiver services that are usually provided by direct caregivers will remain in Idaho. And families in need of caregiver services have options, Idaho health officials say. 
Idaho will keep the family caregiver program in place for the next two months, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Director Juliet Charron at the Department of Health and Welfare told the Sun in an interview Monday.
“We think that’s the right thing to do — to ensure that families have enough time to become aware and to work with their provider agencies,” Charron said.
The next 60 days, she said, will be focused on “communication, connecting families to provider agencies, helping them navigate that, and working through the transition.”
Idaho officials encourage families to reach out to direct care agencies they’ve worked with in the past to see if they have availability, she said.
“CMS determined Idaho’s amendment maintains beneficiary access to needed personal care services through other Medicaid authorities and aligns with the state’s goals of simplifying service delivery and strengthening its oversight of the state Medicaid program,” a CMS spokesperson told the Sun.
 Idaho families have other options, health officials say, like using other family members as caregivers

Family members who aren’t spouses and parents of their loved ones in need of caregiver services can become trained to work as caregivers, Charron said. And spouses and parents who served as caregivers under the program ending can still work as caregivers for other families in need, she said. 
“If they have another family member, a trusted neighbor, a trusted friend who may want to do this kind of support for the family, that they connect with their provider agency to get that individual signed up and through the trainings,” Charron said. 
It just can’t be a “legally responsible individual” like a parent or spouse, she explained, but paid caregivers can be close friends or other family members, like a grandparent, or aunt or uncle. 
Idaho health officials are also seeing a rise in the number of direct care workers who provide disability caregiver services, following reimbursement increases from the Legislature, Charron said.
But those options won’t work for families, said Nathan Hill, a disability advocate who is a paid caregiver for his son with disabilities.
Direct care agencies don’t have enough staff to fill in, he told the Sun in an interview Monday. And having parents or spouses care for other kids with disabilities can create fraud, he said. 
“Nobody knows my child like me,” Hill said. 
And outside caregivers are hard to come by, and often don’t stay long, he said. 
Instead of looking to end the family caregiver program, he said Health and Welfare should’ve asked the Idaho Legislature for more funds to run it. 
And he said he’s still skeptical of Health and Welfare’s claims of fraud and abuse within the family caregiver program, saying the agency hasn’t produced evidence of substantial amounts of fraud. 
Charron, with Health and Welfare, said investigations are ongoing. 
“I can’t comment on specifics of ongoing investigations and anything referred to the Attorney General’s Office. But what I can tell you is that investigations are continuing. And we do have identified instances of fraud, waste and abuse that we are addressing through appropriate channels,” she said. 
 Public comments on Idaho’s attempt to end family caregiver program reflected broader worries

Everyone who submitted public comments on Idaho’s request to end the family caregiver program opposed ending the program, CMS wrote in its letter approving Idaho’s request. 
Most public commenters said allowing parents and spouses to become paid caregivers “improved the quality of care for beneficiaries,” CMS wrote.
Nearly a third of public commenters wanted Idaho to continue the family caregiver program “because the income provides financial stability for families,” CMS wrote. “Parents of individuals requiring (caregiver services) described challenges maintaining other types of employment due to inconsistent coverage from traditional (caregivers).”
A quarter of public commenters worried about poor outcomes and possibly losing progress if they were forced to switch from family caregivers to traditional caregivers, CMS wrote.

The state agency tasked with protecting utility consumers has asked regulators to reject Duke Energy Indiana’s “ill-advised” plan to retire two coal-powered units — and replace them with new natural gas units — at the Cayuga Generating Station in west-central Indiana.
The project would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s 1005-megawatt capacity. Cayuga has operated for 55-plus years and is the oldest coal-fired facility in Duke’s Hoosier fleet.
But it also comes with an estimated $3.3 billion price tag that financing costs could balloon to $5.3 billion, according to Duke. The company is one of the “big five” investor-owned regulated monopolies.
“Between 2026 and 2032, the average estimated rate impact is about 5.4%. A future rate case following that time period will determine the project’s base rate impact,” Spokeswoman Angeline Protogere said in a Monday statement to the Capital Chronicle.

If approved, Duke estimates that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill. But that amount would rise as construction continues — with the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) estimating a total impact of $19.37 monthly.
Duke contends the pay-as-we-go approach will “smooth out” the impact to its Hoosier customers and save them an estimated $812 million over the life of the revamped facility.
In addition to requesting denial, the office asked that the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission direct Duke to consider alternatives: extending the existing units’ lifespan or converting them to natural gas.
Adding a decade to that lifespan would cost $430 million in maintenance and compliance, per Duke — and wouldn’t grow capacity. Neither would conversion.
Protogere said the utility’s Hoosier service area has gained nearly 116,000 customers since adding its last major generation facility in 2013. She added that “Indiana’s economy has been growing, and we have an obligation to meet that demand.”
Agency pushes for a “no”
In testimony filed this month, OUCC Electric Division Director Brian Latham said the investment is particularly “ill-advised” because President Donald Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Braun are “resoundingly reexamining” the environmental factors driving the shift away from coal.
Latham further testified that technological advancements, like small modular nuclear reactors, could render the project “obsolete”  before its planned decades-long lifespan has elapsed.
The consequences of the project becoming a stranded asset are “much greater” than the costs of the alternatives, Electric Division Assistant Director Cynthia Armstrong said.
Duke’s Protogere rejected such arguments, emphasizing the “near-term need for additional power.” She wrote that “waiting to see” how regulations and technology “might evolve isn’t an option.”
Although Duke Managing Director Nathan Gagnon has testified that the new natural gas units are more affordable than conversion, Electric Division Utility Analyst John Hanks argued his cost comparisons were faulty, making retirement and replacement “look more attractive.”
OUCC Natural Gas Division Utility Analyst Jared Hoff, meanwhile, contended that Duke “inappropriately understated” its plan’s operational costs by not discussing three elements: expenses for natural gas itself, transmission via the Rockies Express Pipeline system and CenterPoint Energy Indiana North’s construction of a connector pipeline. They’re part of separate proceedings.
As Indiana manufacturing grows, ‘we clearly don’t have enough electricity,’ governor warns

Hoff estimated Duke undercounted natural gas spending by $300 million; pipeline-related estimates were redacted as “highly confidential.” He noted that Duke has entered into transmission agreements with both entities, but an executed construction contract hasn’t yet nabbed commission approval.
Other office witnesses accused Duke of overstating indirect and transmission upgrade costs and not fully evaluating some bids, while another said the utility company should choose the lesser of two options when it proposes profit margins for financing cost recovery.
Hoosiers weigh in
More than 2,000 public comments — in support and opposition — were additionally filed.
“We need much more capacity to allow for growth of industry,” wrote Bedford resident Bradford Dykes, while Terre Haute mechanical construction company Freitag-Weinhardt called the project a “sound investment in Indiana’s energy future.”
The Indiana State Building & Construction Trades Council applauded the expected 550 construction jobs, plus long-term operations jobs and increased property tax revenue for Vermillion County.
In other comments, Hoosiers railed against rising bills.
“People have to choose whether to pay for groceries, medicine or their electric bill(s),” plus “whether to run their air conditioning or suffer through the heat,” wrote Valparaiso resident Marissa Barnes. “We heard as much through the public hearings for Duke’s 2024 rate case, and that was before folks saw their Duke bills increase by $19/month from the rate hike they just got.”
“There won’t be any AC in hell when you people get there,” wrote Marty Wyatt, who accused regulators of taking bribes. He didn’t identify his place of residence.
Others professed support for coal’s retirement at Cayuga but were unsatisfied with natural gas as the replacement — “another fossil fuel,” wrote Bloomington resident Christine Glaser.
Citizens Action Coalition and Reliable Energy, two groups often on opposite sides of the energy debates, also opposed the plan. The latter called the office’s recommendation a “major victory for Indiana ratepayers.
Duke is scheduled to file rebuttal testimony May 29.

After a pair was discovered nesting in Wyoming, scientists hope to learn more about the eastern owls' behavior and their implications for native raptors.
The post Researchers tag Wyoming’s first barred owl near its Grand Teton nest appeared first on WyoFile .","Jackson researchers had been attempting to trap the male barred owl for more than a week, but the wary raptor was proving elusive. First, the owl swooped in for the bait mouse but glanced off the trap. The next time, he performed evasive flight maneuvers and escaped. 
Then on Thursday, they set up a different trap in the Teton County forest habitat, this time with dho-gazza nets — fine mist nets designed to envelop raptors that unknowingly fly into them. 
“And then, literally out of nowhere, the female came in and got caught,” said Bryan Bedrosian, conservation director at the Teton Raptor Center. 
His team affixed the female with a GPS tracker. And like that, the bird became the first-known barred owl tagged in Wyoming. To Bedrosian’s knowledge, it’s also the first barred owl tagged in the Rocky Mountains.
The tagging comes two years after the pair became the first documented nesting barred owls in Wyoming, news that ruffled some scientific feathers. Though they are eastern birds, barred owls have expanded their range westward through the boreal forests of Canada and down into the Pacific Northwest, where they have outcompeted the imperiled northern spotted owls and created significant management conflicts.

Wyoming raptor experts and others are wary about the impact the adaptable and aggressive barred owls could have on native species like great gray owls. 
Those concerns prompted the Teton Raptor Center to initiate the tracking project. Bedrosian and his team aim to tag the female’s wily mate, along with any chicks that hatch from a nest the pair is currently tending. The goal is to gather data on the birds’ movement and behavior to see if and how it’s impacting other raptors.
“I’m not suggesting we do anything right now, but with any invasive species, it’s always easiest to do action at the beginning rather than being reactionary later,” Bedrosian said. Information gathering is step one. 
Potential competition
Barred owls are similar in size to great horned owls, but lack the distinctive “horns.” They are similar in profile to great gray owls, but are smaller and have black eyes in contrast to the great grays’ yellow ones. 
In Washington, Oregon and California, their negative impacts on federally protected northern spotted owls have prompted wildlife authorities to classify them as invasive. Barred owls, which are territorial and eat a variety of prey, have edged out the more shy and specialized spotted owls. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has wrestled with the issue for years, even resorting to killing barred owls to help prevent further damage to the declining spotted owls. Those conflicts stirred up concern after the nesting pair was documented in Wyoming by nature photographer Tom Stanton.

But Wyoming, unlike the PNW, has limited data.
The relationship between barred and spotted owls in the Pacific Northwest is “one of the most extensively studied cases of competitive exclusion in the history of wildlife ecology,” said Wyoming Fish and Game Nongame Bird Biologist Zach Wallace.
Meanwhile, Wallace said, “next to nothing is known about potential competition between barred owls and great gray owls.”
The Wyoming project, he said, is a good step toward filling in that information gap. That’s why his agency helped support the application for a grant that’s helping to fund it. 
The National Park Service is also in the loop on the project and monitoring the situation, Bedrosian said. 
Data gathering 
Barred owl sightings are not unheard of in Wyoming — the 2023 report is just the first documentation of a nesting pair. What scientists are trying to understand now is what the nesting birds do year round, and if others are present in the state and pose competition to other owls. 
Teton Raptor Center is approaching the questions with a multi-pronged strategy. One prong involves analyzing years of historic acoustic data in the region.
The center also received grants from the Wyoming Governor’s Big Game License Coalition, the Jackson Hole Community Foundation and the Jackson Conservation District to help monitor the birds with GPS transmitters, satellite trackers and acoustic recorders. 

Tom Stanton first glimpsed evidence that barred owls had successfully bred in Wyoming on June 28, 2023, when two fluffy chicks poked their heads from the tree cavity. Their mother watched from the cavity. (Thomas Stanton) 
The team this spring placed recorders in roughly 200 spots in the Grand Teton National Park vicinity — those recorders yielded proof that at least one other individual, likely a bachelor male, has been in the region.
The final piece is the tracking. The hope is to tag each member of the nesting family, Bedrosian said. The owls produced three chicks in 2023, but their nest failed in 2024. They are nesting again currently, though it’s unknown how many eggs they have. 
But if they get trackers on all of the owls, ecologists can better understand their territory, where they spend the winter months, where their offspring go and if there is competition with other species. 
“One of the biggest concerns is the potential impact on other species that aren’t used to this generalist, very aggressive predator,” Bedrosian said. 
“Where this bird has been located is a historic great gray owl territory that is now vacant,” he continued. “And so did the barred owls push out the great gray? We don’t know. But if you take evidence from the Pacific Northwest with the spotted owls, it doesn’t look good.”

Without proper teacher training and enforceable policies, literacy becomes a privilege when it should be available to all K-12 students, write three mothers of children with dyslexia.
The post The tragedy of dyslexia in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","In Wyoming, reading is not a guaranteed right — it’s a privilege. For children with dyslexia, the state’s failure to provide timely, evidence-based support has created a crisis. Education should level the playing field, but in Wyoming, only families with legal knowledge and financial means can secure necessary services. For many, the system’s failure is not just inadequate — it’s tragic.

Opinion

A hidden crisis
Dyslexia affects 10-20% of the population and is the most common learning disability. Yet Wyoming’s schools lack a structured, evidence-based approach to identifying and supporting dyslexic students. Without early intervention, these children fall behind academically and suffer emotionally, while their needs go unrecognized.
A system that favors the privileged
Wyoming lacks strong dyslexia laws and consistent policies. Many students are never screened and teachers are not required to use evidence-based methods. Families with resources can pay for private evaluations, legal help and tutoring. Those without are left behind — especially in rural communities — trapped in a cycle of illiteracy.
Deliberate indifference
This is not just a moral failure — it is a legal one. Wyoming school districts are violating federal law. By failing to provide appropriate accommodations and evidence-based interventions for students with dyslexia, they are in direct violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. These laws exist to protect the rights of students with disabilities.
The Wyoming Department of Education and the school districts have actual knowledge of the educational needs of students with dyslexia. They are aware of what these students require to access education equally, yet often fail to act or respond with reckless indifference. Parents repeatedly voice concerns and file complaints, but many are ignored, dismissed or forced into lengthy legal battles. This deliberate inaction, despite clear evidence and expert recommendations, constitutes more than neglect — it is a violation of students’ civil rights.
The harm is well known: When schools deny timely, structured literacy instruction, dyslexic children fall further behind, experience emotional distress and lose confidence. Families, when they can afford to, are spending tens of thousands of dollars on private services — services that are supposed to be provided under federal law at no cost to them. Meanwhile, students from low-income or rural communities are left without recourse, further entrenching inequity.
Wyoming’s neglect is not only unethical — it is unlawful.
Dyslexia and potential
Dyslexia is not a marker of low intelligence. Many successful figures — from Albert Einstein to Stephen Spielberg to Bill Gates — have dyslexia. These children are bright and capable, but Wyoming’s inaction robs them of their future. If the state truly valued these students, it would invest in proper teacher training and enforce policies that ensure access to structured literacy.
A call to action
Wyoming must:

Mandate early and ongoing dyslexia screening for K-12 students.
Require teacher certification in International Dyslexia Association-approved methods in every school.
Establish legally enforceable dyslexia policies that ensure schools provide structured literacy instruction.
Remove financial discrimination for families seeking basic services for their children to read.

The state’s continued inaction sends a clear message: Literacy is not a right for all — it is a privilege reserved for those who can afford to fight for it. It’s time to make it a right for everyone. The state knows what works — so why isn’t it acting?

This was before the clashes with police later that night. (Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Imagine you hear about a protest in your community and,  curious, you join your neighbors who are marching in the street. Although the protest is loud and slows down  traffic, it appears peaceful and non-violent. Then suddenly, someone throws a rock or spray-paints a building, and now you find yourself among those apprehended for felony rioting, regardless of whether you committed an act of vandalism or  know who did.
Civil rights advocates fear such a scenario if under a Republican bill that defines a riot as a public disturbance, an act of violence or a “clear and present danger” of property destruction or personal injury involving at least three people. A similar bill was introduced in 2017 by Rep. John Spiros (R-Marshfield). A new version is  (AB-88), authored by Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) and Sen. Dan Feyen (R- Fond du Lac). 
People who say their property was damaged or vandalized during what the bill defines as a “riot” would also be able to seek civil damages from people or organizations that “provided material support or resources with the intent that such support or resources would be used to perpetrate the offense,” under the bill. It also prohibits government officials with direct authority over law enforcement agencies from limiting or restricting those agencies’ ability to quell vandalism or rioting, as defined by the bill.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Jon McCray Jones, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin is concerned that the bill’s definition of a “riot” is too vague. “Using that definition, a riot could be three teenagers driving around in a car knocking off mail boxes,” McCray Jones told Wisconsin Examiner. “Technically, with this definition, a riot could be a food fight.” The bill’s language concerning people who “urge, promote, organize, encourage, or instigate others to commit a riot” is also vague according to McCray Jones, who says this aspect of the bill would open protest leaders and organizers up to criminal and civil liability, regardless of their involvement in rioting.
Sortwell and Feyen did not respond to requests for comment for this story. In written testimony before the Assembly Committee on Judiciary on May 7, both lawmakers said that riots have become more common in recent years. “We saw the destructive riots a few years ago in several metropolitan areas, including right here in Madison and Kenosha,” said Sortwell, referring to George Floyd-inspired protests and unrest in 2020. “Taking a walk down State Street, one would see busted doors and windows of businesses, products stolen, and a smashed statue of a Civil War hero. Several business owners, employees, and citizens had their lives upended.”
Feyen said that “peaceful protests are a cornerstone of our public discourse and will always be protected under the First Amendment, but a line needs to be drawn when those protests go from being peaceful to being destructive and violent.” Although the bill does not  mention specific protests, Feyen wrote, “stricter penalties are needed to deter protesters from crossing that line from protest to property destruction, vandalism, arson, and physical violence.” 
Although scenes of burning buildings and looted stores received a lot of news coverage in 2020, studies suggest that at least 96% of Black Lives Matter protests during the movement’s peak in May and June of 2020 were peaceful. Reports by TMJ4 found that 74.3% of the nearly 200 people who’d been placed on an intelligence list by police in Milwaukee county that year had never been charged with a misdemeanor or felony. Some reports, however, using data derived from insurance claims, estimate that as much as $2 billion in damage nationally occurred due to protests in 2020. 
Some residents of Kenosha – a city referenced by the bill’s authors – recall how months of non-violent protest in Kenosha after Floyd’s death were overshadowed by the unrest that  occurred in August 2020. The shooting of Jacob Blake by Kenosha officer Rusten Sheskey, which paralyzed Blake, led to days of protest and unrest, millions of dollars worth of property destruction, and ended when  then-17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse fatally shot two people and wounded another, in what a jury later ruled was an act of self-defense.

During committee hearings on May 7, Sortwell said that the bill seeks to punish not only people who commit vandalism but also “those people who put together the riot.”
Several groups have either lobbied or spoken out against the bill. The Wisconsin Civil Justice Council submitted written testimony opposing the bill on the behalf of “16 business associations working together on civil liability matters.” The council said that the bill would allow for civil compensation for emotional distress stemming from property destruction, noting that emotional damages are generally limited. AB-88 would also allow for any civil compensation to include attorneys’ fees, which would be another departure from current law, the council wrote. Others spoke against the bill in person on May 7, pointing to the bill’s broad language and the chilling effect it could have on political movements. 
“This bill is just a blatant attempt to stop people from protesting,” said McCray Jones. “This is a way to silence organizers from fighting for political change and threatening the status quo in power.” Organizers could potentially be sued for anything that happens at a protest, or even just for transporting someone to a protest that later turns into a riot, as defined under the bill. 
What counts as urging or promoting a riot is broad enough to include common protest chants, like “no justice, no peace,” McCray Jones said. “And if you have ambitious or politically motivated district attorneys…politically motivated prosecutors, the vagueness of this bill could be weaponized … free speech now gets criminally turned into inciting a riot.” 
McCray Jones added that he wonders what a police figure like former Milwaukee PD Chief Harold Breier — notorious for targeting and surveilling Black, brown and LGBTQ communities — would have been able to accomplish had such a law been at his disposal.

As police departments develop their social media surveillance capabilities, it’s possible under the bill that making posts encouraging people to attend a protest could be seen as an attempt to “urge, promote, organize, encourage, or instigate” a riot under the bill. After the protests of 2020, some agencies that monitored protesters enacted new intelligence-gathering policies to help prevent broad, ideology-based surveillance.  
“I think that right now this moment gives us a very opportune chance to highlight the importance of protecting the privacy of protesters here in Wisconsin,” McCray Jones told Wisconsin Examiner. McCray Jones said he hopes debate about the bill  will become “a jumping off point to talk about not just data privacy for protesters, not just privacy from law enforcement for marginalized communities, but what does it look like to re-think our position on surveillance in the midst of this regime in D.C. that is blatantly ignoring due process, the rule of law, and civil rights.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_9439-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 07:08:18.976649

(Photo by Shirlaine Forrest/Getty Images)We’ve all heard about the nine Republican state Senators who decided they were going to start voting their conscience, only to be censured by their own party. As if they would somehow become contagious. 
This series of events reminded me of something I’ve been wondering about, which is: Why it has become so fashionable to present ‘liberals’ as if we are dangerous, scary people. It is now one of those labels that Republicans throw around in order to discredit a person’s character. It showed up on every other flyer that I received during the last election cycle. And of course it’s one of those terms, for example “communist,” that most people probably wouldn’t be able to define if you asked them, even liberals themselves.
So I thought about the qualities that most of my friends have in common. And the top thing on that list would probably be curiosity. I hang out with people who always want to learn more, whether it’s about you, or about the history of the region where they live, or about whatever hobby they’re interested in. And of course that also means that they are readers. Because what is the best way to learn? 
Another thing that most of my friends have in common is that they love people. They love meeting new people, they like to be in small groups where they can have discussions. They like to connect. And they like to help. I feel fortunate to know so many people who believe that helping others helps them become better people. And it also helps make the world a better place.
So far, I’m not seeing a lot to be scared of. But let’s keep looking.
Most of my friends love the arts. They love how music and films and dance and visual arts force them to look at things a little differently. They love how songs and movies make them feel something, whether it’s warm or frightening or confusing or ecstatic, the arts bring strong emotional responses into our lives in a way that is always unpredictable and surprising.
Most of my friends also love to be outside. They love what the earth has to offer. They like the challenge of a long bike ride, or a hike into the mountains. They like to hunt and fish, or float one of the incredible rivers that flow through our beautiful state. They value having access to the best that Montana has to offer.
A few days ago, Bruce Springsteen, who is only three years younger than Trump but looks at least 10 years younger, opened his latest tour in Manchester, England by sitting down at the front of the stage and delivering a calm, measured criticism of the current president. He didn’t make anything up or call him a bunch of juvenile names. He didn’t threaten him. He just laid out his opinion of the man’s actions in a way that was thoughtful and most importantly, factual. Here’s how he opened his speech, and it’s pretty brilliant:
“In America, my home, they’re persecuting people for their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. That’s happening now. In America, the richest men are taking satisfaction in abandoning the world’s poorest children to sickness and death. That’s happening now. In my country, they’re taking sadistic pleasure in the pain they inflict on loyal American workers. They’re rolling back historic civil rights legislation that led to a more just society. They’re abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those who are struggling for their freedom. That’s happening now. They are defunding American universities that won’t bow down to their ideological demands. And they are removing residents off American streets without due process of law and deploying them to foreign detention centers and prisons. That’s happening now.”
So maybe that’s it. It’s the honesty.
Most of my friends have never been convicted of a felony. Most of them have never been accused of rape, especially by multiple sources. Most of my friends wouldn’t think of referring to another country as a “sh–hole country.” They wouldn’t think to lump an entire race of people into one group and make sweeping generalizations about those people. Most of my wealthy friends wouldn’t think of rubbing their wealth in your face, or bragging about the fact that they don’t pay taxes, because they do. Most of them wouldn’t brag about going into the dressing room of a bunch of teenage girls while they’re getting ready for a pageant.
Most of my friends wouldn’t encourage people to beat the crap out of other people. Most of them wouldn’t make up lies on the spot just to make others look bad because they got their feelings hurt.
So the only thing that I can think of that makes liberals scary is that they try like hell to be honest, and if there’s one thing that scares Republicans at this moment in time, it’s the truth. Springsteen is fortunate to be huge enough that he can lose a huge chunk of his fan base without worrying about his career going off the rails. 
But of course that doesn’t stop Donald Trump from trying his damnedest to discredit the man. And among other things, that means hitting him over the head with the dreaded “liberal” label. It didn’t stop Springsteen from doing the same thing at his next few stops, to the dismay of many of his long-term fans, and as someone so accurately pointed out, have they not been paying attention to what this man has stood for from the beginning?
The saddest part about Trump’s tantrums is how utterly childish they are. He always resorts to the most basic insults, saying he never liked Springsteen and that he has no talent—a meaningless insult coming from a guy who pals around with Kid Rock and Ted Nugent. Trump has and always will resort to the lowest form of attack, and that is exactly why he is so threatened by someone like Bruce, who did just the opposite.
So I guess I’ll keep doing what most of my friends have been doing, trying to become better people, failing here and there, but always striving to improve. Telling the truth as well as we know how, without resorting to hissy fits when someone offers constructive criticism. And hopefully it will continue to scare the hell out of these people.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2215118078.jpg,,,2025-05-20 07:08:18.976649

Bottoms spoke on the President's upcoming visit to the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for a Martin Luther King Jr. service. Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesFormer Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is announcing Tuesday that she is entering the race for Georgia governor in 2026, the second Democrat to declare a run for the state’s top job.
Bottoms served as mayor of Atlanta from 2018 to 2022, but after a controversial first term decided against seeking reelection. Bottoms would later become a senior advisor to former President Joe Biden.
Bottoms said Monday that she was prepared for the role of governor after achieving historic pay raises for Atlanta police officers and firefighters and ensuring the vitality of small businesses, especially during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
During her tenure as mayor, Bottoms faced several crises, from the pandemic to a citywide cyberattack.
She came under withering attack for her handling of protests after the murder of George Floyd in the spring of 2020, especially for allowing an armed encampment at a burned down Atlanta Wendy’s that didn’t end until a girl was murdered while riding in a car near the scorched restaurant.
One of the most important lessons Bottoms said she learned was the importance of being prepared for uncertain times.
“When I left as mayor of Atlanta, even in the midst of this historic economic downturn, we still had $180 million in our rainy day fund,” she said. “We didn’t lay off a single employee. We even gave our sanitation workers $500 additional pay each month, hazard pay during COVID. We didn’t raise taxes, we didn’t furlough employees, and it was because we planned ahead and we had a north star to always be able to deliver for our communities.”
Georgia’s 2026 election for governor is wide open with GOP Gov. Brian Kemp term-limited. A large number of candidates are expected to run and several have already thrown their hats into the ring.
Republican candidates who have entered the governor’s race or are considering running for governor include Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, who announced his candidacy in November. Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is expected to run against Carr for the chance to oppose the Democratic nominee in November 2026.
Bottoms is the second Democratic candidate with name recognition to enter the race for governor. In May, Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves launched his campaign.
Meg Scribner, Esteves’ campaign manager, responded to Bottoms’ announcement by saying they are ready to take on any new challenger.
“Jason represents a new wave of Democratic leadership, and that is already energizing voters in Georgia,” Scribner said. “As a former teacher, (Atlanta) school board chair, small business owner, and state senator, Georgians can count on Jason to stay in the fight and build a winning coalition that will flip the Governor’s seat in 2026.”
Bottoms says her campaign will prioritize issues that are important outside of Atlanta. She said if she’s elected governor, she’ll push to expand Medicaid to cover health insurance for about 300,000 people, support small businesses and eliminate teacher income taxes.
“We all want safe and thriving communities,” Bottoms said. “We all want economic stability. We all want job opportunities. We all want access to quality public education. We all want access to quality health care.”
Bottoms said she’s ready to take criticism for not running for a second term leading the city of Atlanta.
She says points in her favor are the way she stood up to Trump in his first term during her first three years as Atlanta mayor.
Even though they disagree politically, Bottoms says she’s willing to work with any president.
“We can work with any administration that’s trying to do right by our communities, then I’ll be a leader that works alongside people, even if we don’t have the same political affiliation,” Bottoms said. “But to the extent that policies are coming out of the White House like they are now, that’s harming our communities, then I’m going to fight to the bitter end to make sure that Georgia has what it needs to thrive.”
Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, said it’s important for Bottoms to have a strong turnout of Black voters in the primary and general election as well as winning support outside of Atlanta.
“She has the advantage of having led George’s largest city,” Gillespie said. “She has the advantage of having some support from Washington D.C. Democratic figures.
“I think some of the disadvantages are the fact that this would be her first campaign running for statewide office. It’s not that she’s a novice or an inexperienced candidate, but I’ve done research that would suggest that she would be better served if she held statewide office before the fact,” Gillespie said.
“For somebody like Sen. Esteves, he can test the water, but if it doesn’t look like it’s going well, he would have time to change if he needed to and return to the Senate,” Gillespie said.
According to Gillespie, the looming question among Democratic candidates is whether Stacey Abrams will make a third run after the governor’s mansion after narrowly losing to Kemp in 2018 and then more decisively in 2022.
Democrats need to resolve organizational problems to have a chance to beat a Republican for governor, Gillespie said.
“They’re all going to tout their own achievements and their own experience,” Gillespie said. “I think the larger question for Democrats is who is best positioned to run against whoever the Republicans end up nominating for office.”
In 2020, Gillespie sees a Republican opponent trying to pigeonhole Bottoms as a “woke’” candidate, challenged for her stances on COVID policies and handling of protests.
“I expect that somebody might try to use that against her, both in the primary and in the general election,” she said. “And then there’s also the (issue of) having been out of the political spotlight for, you know, a long period of time.”

Patrick Morrisey to serve as secretary of the West Virginia Department of Human Services. (Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)On a Thursday evening in Parkersburg, a group of local residents gathered to discuss West Virginia foster care — a system that is struggling from top to bottom with thousands of kids in care.
A moderator asked foster and biological parents, child welfare workers, judges and others to describe their experience with the system. 
Their responses: “Challenging.” “Overwhelming.” “Traumatizing.” “Broken.”
“Nobody would listen. Nobody would talk to me,” said Lisa Easter, who had more than 50 foster children in her home in 25 years. 
Julie Jones stopped fostering after Child Protective Services went months without checking on a newborn baby in her care. She was mailed a blank birth certificate and worried if the state was aware of the child’s whereabouts. “I couldn’t do it any longer,” she said.
In the corner of the room, new Department of Human Services Secretary Alex Mayer listened as people described a frustrating system riddled with inconsistencies, staffing shortages, an overwhelmed judicial system, limited support and children who have been victims of it all. 
Mayer, who came from South Dakota, believes it can be fixed. It’s going to take time, he says, but work is underway. He is focused on accountability, transparency and putting in processes that aren’t in place for consistency. He wants more in-state programs that can help kids with behavioral health struggles. 
“It’s going to be incremental over time,” Mayer said. “I think it’s going to be a long road until we have everything addressed confidently … You’ll be seeing here shortly some really positive steps.”
A federal judge recently said West Virginia’s foster care system has suffered from “shocking neglect” and “bureaucratic indifference.” 
There’s a shortage of social workers, support services and safe homes for children in a state that is fastest to remove children from homes and terminate parental rights. Too many children have ended up living in hotel rooms, and the state spent $70 million last year sending foster kids to out-of-state group homes. 
“The thing that was shocking to me was the number of kids in care,” Mayer said. 
There are more than 6,100 children in West Virginia foster care, and the number has skyrocketed during the state’s drug crisis. The state’s high poverty rate has contributed to the number, too.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey appointed 37–year-old Mayer to oversee DoHS.
Mayer will have to grapple with pervasive foster care problems as the Trump administration proposes cuts to programs that serve families in poverty and help vulnerable kids. The state could see a decline in federal funding, impacting programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that are intertwined with child welfare. DoHS also oversees Medicaid, SNAP and more.
“Child welfare is a very intricate, complex system, and there’s a lot of different players, which … obviously increases the level of complexity,” Mayer said. “I’ve been really intentional and just trying to get out to learn the system.”

The meeting was facilitated by the West Virginia Department of Human Services. (Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)    ‘I just have a passion for helping’
Mayer, who was adopted, spent time in the military before working at a residential facility that served people with severe mental illnesses He later worked in South Dakota’s state government, dealing with SNAP and child welfare. 
“Different steps in my life have led me down this path,” he said. “Over time, I think I’ve just developed this passion for solving problems, which I think has inherently then created this desire to support families and kids … I just have a passion for helping.”
He has spent the last few months traveling the state meeting with his staff, touring residential facilities and trying to understand how the system works. 
The federal government is continuing its oversight of West Virginia’s foster care system after it was flagged for sending too many children with disabilities to group homes. The state still sends children with disabilities to group homes and treatment centers at a rate three times the national average. 
Two-hundred and seventy children are in out-of-state facilities around the county — some miles away from their biological families — because the state doesn’t have enough in-state beds that can serve children’s complex needs. The state’s CPS workers are required to visit kids once a month. 
Mayer said he’s examining where the state could increase specialized care, like being able to serve children with aggressive or sexualized behaviors who aren’t able to be served in a traditional foster home.
“We don’t have placements for these kids. Well, that’s not an option anymore,” he said. “And, if those placements aren’t here … then we have to find a way to make that happen, because we want to keep kids as close as possible to their support network for a variety of reasons.”
There’s a shortage of foster families, and Mayer hopes to bolster recruitment and support services. 
He noted that a glaring shortage  of after school and summer programs for teens, which could be useful in helping working parents take in teenagers in foster care. Teens ages 13 to 17 are the most common age group in state foster care.
There’s also a need for creating agency processes that will breed consistently in decision making across the state, Mayer said. Child welfare cases involve a number of stakeholders — judges, attorneys, CPS workers and others — who all have an opinion and sometimes decision making about a child’s future. 
“I think our practice model is one of those pieces that needs some real work,” he said.
Earlier this year, Mayer pushed back on a Republican-sponsored bill, which ultimately failed, that would have mandated an outside audit of the foster care system. Mayer vowed changes to lawmakers without a study. 
Potential federal funding changes under Trump
West Virginia’s foster care system relies on federal and state funding, and there’s some unpredictability in spending due to kids fluctuating in and out of care and the rising price of out-of-state facilities. 
Lawmakers, who have struggled in recent years to get a handle on the agency’s spending, allocated more than $300 million to foster care in their recently-passed budget. Their 2026 budget bill mandated that DoHS spend some money on designated line items to prevent the agency from shifting money around to pay bills. But Morrisey vetoed that idea, saying it was too restrictive for DoHS. 
The Republican governor,  who wants to reign in state spending, also vetoed line item funding for programs that support babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome and foster children.
Mayer said that right now, he doesn’t think the department needs additional funding to tackle the crisis. It will likely rely on partnerships with the faith-based community, businesses and others that provide services to help children and families, he said.
“I think we just need to get more attention on what is it going to take?” he said. “I don’t know what that funding would be, or if it needs to be anything.”
The state’s federal funding could change since Republicans in Washington have proposed cuts to SNAP and Medicaid — a program that provides health insurance to West Virginia foster children and half of all children in the state. 
“We’ve been watching that really intently,” Mayer said regarding the potential federal changes.
This month, he has traveled around the state for additional foster care listening sessions in towns including Beckley, Burlington and Wheeling to hear from families, CPS workers and others. It’s important, he said. The outside firm leading the sessions will compile a report detailing problems and potential solutions.
“I’m kind of excited to see, you know, what we’re able to accomplish here,” he said.



DoHS responds to latest update in foster care lawsuit
A Better Childhood, a group representing children suing the state over its troubled foster care system, wants the lawsuit revived after a judge tossed the case in February. 
In an email, a DoHS spokesperson said, “We recognize that the only way to facilitate and bring about real change is to bring all of the key players together to openly and honestly discuss problems and develop real solutions.
“The first steps we are taking, through listening tours and meaningful conversations, are designed to build bridges among the necessary parties who must work together to find sustainable, long-term solutions for the children in our care.”

Preserving biodiversity in the Badger State is a multi-faceted effort, merging legislative efforts with organized social gatherings to find creative solutions. 
Late last week, a package of bills was introduced to help shore up protections for pollinators. The package of seven bills has a range of policy objectives including:

Requiring state agencies and government entities to give preference to use native prairie and forage plants to benefit pollinators. 
Designating June 2025 as Pollinator Awareness Month in Wisconsin. 
Allowing a political subdivision to regulate pesticides for the purpose of protecting pollinators and pollinator habitats. 
Prohibiting people who sell plants from advertising or labeling the plants as good for pollinators if they are treated with certain insecticides.
Establishing a “Protect Pollinators” license plate program, similar to other conservation-focused license plate programs. 
Prohibiting the DNR from using any insecticide from the neonicotinoid class near any pollinator habitat located on DNR-maintained land. 
Designating Rusty Patched Bumble Bee as the state native insect and requiring the Wisconsin Blue Book to include information concerning that designation. 

The bills were announced in Menasha by Reps  Lee Snodgrass (D- Appleton) and Vincent Miresse (D- Stevens Point). Luke Schiller, executive director of the Heckrodt Wetland Reserve and Sara Walling, Clean Wisconsin’s water program director, attended the announcement. 
Pollinators are important not only to ecosystems, but also to the global economy. According to an article in Forbes, pollinators contribute between $235 billion and $577 billion in global food production. Pollinators come in all shapes and sizes and include bees, hummingbirds, butterflies and certain species of bats. Decades of overusing pesticides and habitat destruction have contributed to staggering declines in pollinator populations across the globe, and throughout ecosystems. 
The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is seeking volunteers to monitor one of those pollinators, the Karner blue butterfly. Volunteers have been crucial  in tracking the endangered butterfly since 2018. Although the butterflies are found from Minnesota to Maine to Canada, Wisconsin has the largest remaining population. Karner Blue Butterflies are threatened by habitat loss fragmenting their range into isolated pockets and climate change. Open barrens, savannas and prairies are still abundant in Wisconsin, and are ideal habitats for the butterfly. 
“Volunteers will be able to identify Karner blue butterflies and help us collect data to look at how this species moves around the landscape over time,” Chelsea Weinzinger the DNR’s Karner blue butterfly recovery coordinator said in a statement. “Collecting this information improves our data and gives us a better statewide picture of how this species is faring.” The Karner is related to the northern blue butterfly, which some DNR researchers say they haven’t seen since 2010 in Wisconsin. 
Field trip opportunities are also available through the Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin. The field trips occur across the state and range from paddling wetland habitats to joining researchers in Beaver Creek Reserve to learn about the state’s smallest falcon species. Several field trips are also occurring in the Milwaukee-area, offering people the chance to canoe under tree canopies on the Milwaukee River, traverse urban habitats, explore hardwood forests and wetlands in the Mequon Nature Preserve   and much more.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd) Kentuckians living with addiction can call Kentucky’s help line at 833-859-4357. Narcan, which can help reverse overdoses, is available at pharmacies for sale and through some health departments and outreach programs for free. 
Even though overdose deaths have declined over the last three years, Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States, according to a national report released Tuesday. 
“The cost of addiction: Opioid use disorder in the United States” shows Kentucky is one of four states where the rate of opioid use disorder is higher than 2.5% of the population aged 12 or older. The others are New Hampshire, Nevada and Massachusetts. 
  Margaret Scott is a principle at Avalere Health. (Photo provided)
Margaret Scott, an author of the study from Avalere Health, said the estimate is based on the National Survey on Drug Use. The report doesn’t look at factors that might lead to higher or lower rates of cases. 
“We did rely on the national figures from the national survey, but this is self reported cases of opioid use disorder, so it is possible that individuals in those states are more likely to self report,” she said.  
In 2024, 1,410 Kentuckians died from an overdose, according to the 2024 Drug Overdose Fatality Report. In 2023, there were 1,984 overdose deaths, which was a decrease from the 2,135 lost in 2022. 
“It is encouraging to see the number of overdose deaths decreasing,” Scott said. “We’re still seeing 80,000 overdose deaths in the country. It’s hard to say what is contributing to that decline (in Kentucky), but we do know that OUD is still a significant problem.” 
Ben Mudd, the executive director of the Kentucky Pharmacists Association, said Kentucky does a lot right when it comes to diagnosing and treating addiction. 
“There’s been a huge focus on harm reduction and naloxone distribution and I think that is why we’ve seen the decrease in overdose deaths,” Mudd told the Lantern.  
But that intervention, which can reverse an overdose, “doesn’t necessarily stop new cases.” 
“Those cases still exist,” Mudd said. “There’s so much naloxone out there, people are educated, perhaps people aren’t using alone, things like that. All of those programs that have been put in place have led to fewer overdoses, but not necessarily a reduced number of people with opioid use disorder.” 
  A new report, “The cost of addiction: Opioid use disorder in the United States,” shows Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States. (Screenshot)
What does the report show? 
Tuesday’s report is mostly interested in the costs surrounding OUD and the economic impact of addiction. 
“Some of the costs that we estimated included things like lost income taxes based on the lost productivity for businesses as well as employees’ lost wages. We looked at property, client crime from OUD, as well as different types of costs to the state and local governments,” Scott said. “Those costs included things like Medicaid direct costs for substance use treatment, as well as those lost income taxes and corporate taxes, and then, of course, the criminal justice costs, which would include police presence, courts, jails, all of those things.” 
  Compared to other states, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky and Maine had the highest state and local spending on opioid use disorder as a proportion of state gross domestic product, according to a new report. (Screenshot)
In Kentucky, OUD costs big bucks, according to the report: 

Kentucky has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder in the nation. 
Opioid use disorder costs Kentucky about $95 billion, with an average cost per case of $709,441. 
State and local governments bear more than $2 billion in costs, primarily driven by criminal justice expenses and lost tax revenue. 
The state/local per capita OUD cost is among the highest nationally, between $400-$500 per resident annually.  
OUD-related costs in Kentucky are more than 6% of the state’s gross domestic product.

“Our study shows that barriers to care include physician stigmatizing and expressing reluctance to treat OUD patients, inadequate provider education and training, geographic distances to treatment locations, and social stigma,” Scott said. 
  A new report, “The cost of addiction: Opioid use disorder in the United States,” shows Kentucky still has one of the highest rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States. (Screenshot)
Medicine treatment pays off in the long run, the report says, as it “has been shown to reduce cravings, increase abstinence from opioids and reduce morbidity and mortality, thereby making it a key component for addressing the economic and public health consequences of OUD.” 
Treatments can include medications and therapy. Methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone are treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration for OUD management.
“As states and local governments explore new strategies to reduce healthcare costs, encouraging public health, governments and payers to prioritize OUD treatments can lead to greater savings,” Michael Ciarametaro, managing director at Avalere Health, said in a statement. 
  Ben Mudd is the executive director of the Kentucky Pharmacists Association. (Photo provided)
This is especially true for the formerly incarcerated, who live “opioid naive” behind bars and may, upon release, take the same dose they did before being incarcerated and not have the resistance to handle it, Mudd explained. 
“If you’re incarcerated, you hopefully don’t have access to opioids. But when you leave that facility, many folks go back to the same routine that they were in before, the same environment they were in before,” he said. 
What is Kentucky doing to combat opioid use disorders? 
Kentucky has taken aggressive steps to treat and prevent addiction. The latest Drug Overdose Fatality Report showed that for 2024:   

$29.8 million was distributed in grant and pass-through funding from the state Office of Drug Control Policy. 
170,000 doses of Narcan were distributed.
84 syringe exchange program sites served 27,799 unique participants.
142,312 Kentuckians received addiction services through Medicaid. 
17,399 Kentuckians received treatment paid by the Kentucky Opioid Response Effort. 
17,984 Kentuckians received recovery services like housing assistance, employment services, transportation and basic needs services in their community paid by the Kentucky Opioid Response Effort. 
3,329 incoming calls were made to the KY HELP Call Center with 14,087 outgoing follow up calls. 
21 counties are certified as Recovery Ready Communities representing 1,495,518 Kentuckians. 

There’s still some stigma when it comes to seeking treatment, Mudd said. 
“There are folks, even within my profession, that think that this is just a pill mill,” Mudd said. A “constant turnover” of patients is a “real thing” and “a concern of health care providers across the state.”  
“It’s the nature of addiction and folks with OUD,” he said. “It’s hard to differentiate at the pharmacy counter: ‘Is this patient truly in recovery, or is this patient seeking this product so that they can sell it or trade it or whatever for illicit drugs?’ And that’s tough for pharmacists to make that determination.” 
Some won’t dispense the treatments, he said, while others say, “‘Hey, I want to make sure, just like Naloxone (Narcan), that we see this as a vehicle to help people. Some will use it, some will misuse it, some will divert it.’” 
Meanwhile, he said, the pharmacist association is focused on making sure pharmacies are “good access points” for treatments because, especially in rural areas, people may be able to access a pharmacy much easier than a doctor’s office. 
“If your prescriber, physician, nurse practitioner is 45 minutes an hour away, what we’re trying to do is break down those barriers,” Mudd said. “These products are not available at every drugstore in Kentucky. They’re not stocked at Walgreens. They’re not stocked at your local independent pharmacy. But we know those are good access points.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The city of Pine Bluff will use a $500,000 federal grant to assess multiple brownfields in its downtown district and develop cleanup plans, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday. 
Brownfields are “a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant,” according to the EPA.
The funds will be used to conduct environmental site assessments throughout the city, with a focus on the Saenger Theatre, Hotel Pines and the former Pine Bluff Bus Terminal. Four cleanup plans and a revitalization plan will be prepared using the grant money, according to a news release. 
The grant is part of the EPA’s larger 2025 brownfields grant funding announcement, which saw the agency award more than $200 million. Pine Bluff was the only applicant in Arkansas to receive a grant during this round of funding.
Pine Bluff Mayor Vivian Flowers said the city is “extremely excited” to further its downtown revitalization plans, with the assistance of the grant. 
“We’re excited, and we’re going to make good use of those funds for the people of Pine Bluff,” Flowers said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lori Walker Guelache, director of the city’s Economic and Community Development Department, said the grant money will go toward figuring out redevelopment plans for the three priority properties and area-wide planning. The efforts downtown are part of a broader city revitalization plan.
A key component of the downtown revitalization efforts, Guelache said, is “understanding what’s feasible and how.” 
“The purpose of the assessment grant is to help come up with viable uses, to make sure that we understand what barriers there would be to the site in terms of environmental contaminants or anything like that,” she said.
The downtown area has “historic building stock” that has suffered from years of neglect. The city wants to work to change that, Guelache said. 
The assessments will likely reveal asbestos in Saenger Theatre, and there “could be” asbestos or lead paint in Hotel Pines or the former bus terminal due to their age, Guelache said. Surveyors will look at the historic uses of the buildings to determine what, if any contamination there will require remediation, she said.
The hotel’s current owners envision transforming it into a boutique hotel, Guelache said, while the Saenger Theatre could be used as a stage theater, movie theater or a combination of both.
Not only will this put the city closer to putting the properties back into use, Guelache said, but it will also help preserve unique aspects of downtown Pine Bluff’s history. 
An article republished in Arkansas Historical Quarterly referred to Pine Bluff as a “paradise of the South” for Black people in the late 1800s to early 1900s, Guelache said, because of the privileges that people of color enjoyed during that period. 
“While other communities had established racially segregated business districts, we have evidence in old city directories and old … maps that Pine Bluff — there were Black businesses operating beside white businesses on Main Street,” Guelache said. “It’s like, ‘Why preserve these buildings?’ Outside of who operated out of them, it’s the bigger story of why our downtown is important.”
By preserving and restoring to use historically and culturally significant buildings, the city hopes to highlight and showcase Pine Bluff’s past, Guelache added.

Two days before President Donald Trump announced dramatic plans for “reciprocal” tariffs on foreign imports, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sold stock in almost three dozen companies, according to records reviewed by ProPublica.
The Feb. 11 sales occurred near the stock market’s historic peak, just before it began to slide amid concerns about Trump’s tariff plans and ultimately plummeted after the president unveiled the details of the new tariffs on April 2.
Disclosure records filed by Duffy with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics show he sold between $75,000 and $600,000 of stock two days before Trump’s Feb. 13 announcement, and up to $50,000 more that day.

Transportation secretaries normally have little to do with tariff policy, but Duffy has presented himself as one of the intellectual forefathers of Trump’s current trade agenda. As a congressman in 2019, his last government position before Trump elevated him to his cabinet post, Duffy introduced a bill he named the “United States Reciprocal Trade Act.” The proposed legislation, which did not pass, in many ways mirrors Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan. Duffy worked on that bill with Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro. Trump’s tariffs were “the culmination of that work,” Duffy posted online, referring to his own bill in the House.
Trades by government officials informed by nonpublic information learned in the course of their official duties could violate the law. However, it’s unclear whether Duffy had any information about the timing or scale of Trump’s reciprocal tariff plans before the public did.
Trump had repeatedly promised to institute significant tariffs throughout the campaign. But during the first weeks of his term, investors were not panic selling, seeming to assume Trump wouldn’t adopt the far-reaching levies that led to the market crash following his “Liberation Day” announcement.
In response to questions from ProPublica, a Transportation Department spokesperson said an outside manager made the trades and Duffy “had no input on the timing of the sales” — a defense that ethics experts generally consider one of the strongest against questions of trading on nonpublic information.
His stock transactions “are part of a retirement account and not managed directly by the Secretary. The account managers must follow the guidance of the ethics agreement and they have done so.”
“The Secretary strongly supports the President’s tariff policy, but he isn’t part of the administration’s decisions on tariff levels,” the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson dismissed the notion that knowledge of Trump’s coming tariffs could constitute insider knowledge because “President Trump has been discussing tariffs since the 1980s.”
Duffy is the second cabinet secretary to have sold stock at an opportune time.
AG Pam Bondi sold more than $1 million in Trump Media stock the day sweeping tariffs were announced

Last week, ProPublica reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of shares of Trump Media, the president’s social media company, on April 2. A government ethics agreement required Bondi to sell the shares within 90 days of her confirmation, a deadline that would have given her until early May, but why she sold on that date is unclear. After the market closed that day, Trump presented his tariffs, sending the market reeling.
Following ProPublica’s story, at least two Democratic members of Congress called for investigations. Bondi has yet to answer questions about whether she knew anything about Trump’s tariff plans before the public did. The Justice Department has not responded to questions about the trades.
Disclosure forms for securities trading by government officials do not require them to state the exact amount bought or sold but instead to provide a broad range for the totals of each transaction.
Duffy’s disclosure records show he sold 34 stocks worth between $90,000 and $650,000 on Feb. 11 and Feb. 13. Per the ethics agreement he signed to avoid conflicts of interest as head of the Transportation Department, he was required to sell off stock in seven of those companies during his first three months in office. Cabinet members are typically required to divest themselves of financial interests that intersect with their department’s oversight role, which in Duffy’s case involve U.S. roadways, aviation and the rest of the nation’s transportation network. The ethics agreement was dated Jan. 13, and Duffy was confirmed by the senate on Jan. 28, meaning he had until late April to sell. His spokesperson said he provided his account manager with the ethics agreement on Feb. 7.
The stocks he sold in the other 27 companies were not subject to the ethics agreement. Those shares were valued somewhere between $27,000 and $405,000, according to the records. Among them were Shopify, whose merchants are impacted by the tariffs, and John Deere, the agricultural machinery manufacturer that has projected hundreds of millions of dollars in new costs because of Trump’s tariffs.
Other companies Duffy sold, like gambling firm DraftKings and food delivery service DoorDash, are less directly vulnerable to tariff disruptions. But even those companies will be impacted if Americans have less disposable cash to spend. Few stocks were not hit hard by Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. The S&P 500, a broadbased index, fell almost 19% in the weeks that followed Duffy’s sales and 13% specifically after Trump unveiled the details of his reciprocal tariff plan. Since Trump unexpectedly walked back much of those initial tariffs, the market has rebounded.
There’s no indication that the cash from Duffy’s sales was immediately reinvested. He appears to have held on to parts of his portfolio, including a Bitcoin fund, treasuries, S&P 500 funds and stock in Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, an American biopharma company. (Duffy also purchased some Microsoft shares, one of the stocks he’s prohibited from holding, days earlier on Feb. 7, only to sell them on Feb. 11 with the rest of his sales.)
Trades by government officials informed by nonpublic information learned through their jobs could violate the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, or STOCK, Act. The 2012 law clarified that executive and legislative branch employees cannot use nonpublic government information to trade stock and requires them to promptly disclose their trades.
But no cases have ever been brought under the law, and some legal experts have doubts it would hold up to scrutiny from the courts, which in recent years have generally narrowed what constitutes illegal insider trading. Current and former officials have also raised concerns that Trump’s Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission would not aggressively investigate activities by Trump or his allies.
The president’s selection of Duffy to lead the Department of Transportation was somewhat unexpected. Duffy, who came to fame when he starred in the reality show “The Real World” in the late 1990s, had last held public office in 2019 during Trump’s first term when he served as a Wisconsin congressman.
As a lawmaker, Duffy introduced the bill that would have made it easier for Trump, or any president, to levy new tariffs, a role that had long been largely reserved for Congress. The bill would have allowed the president to impose additional tariffs on imported goods if he determined that another country was applying a higher duty rate on the same goods when they were coming from America.
The bill did not pass, but Trump has essentially assumed that power by justifying new tariffs as essential to national security or in response to a national emergency. His Feb. 13 announcement called on his advisers to come up with new tariff rates on goods coming from countries around the world based on a number of restrictions he said those countries were placing on American products — not just through tariffs, but also with their exchange rates and industry subsidies.
Even the public rollout of Duffy’s bill and Trump’s tariffs were similar. Duffy released a spreadsheet showing how other countries tariffed particular goods at a higher rate than the U.S. Trump also used a spreadsheet during his rollout to show that his new tariffs were the same or lower than the trade restrictions other countries had placed on American goods.
More recently, Duffy has been a booster of Trump’s trade policies.
“LIBERATION DAY!!We’re not gonna take it anymore!,” he tweeted two days after Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs on April 2. “This week, @POTUS took a historic step towards stopping other countries from ripping off the American worker and restoring Fair Trade. In Congress, I helped lead the US Reciprocal Trade Act with @RealPNavarro and the @WhiteHouse to expand the President’s tariff powers in his first term. I am so proud to have been able to share the culmination of that work, Liberation Day, with my family this week. Thank you at POTUS!”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee House Republican leadership could hit an impasse again in 2026 over a measure designed to restrict immigrant student enrollment in public schools.
With the bill on the skids in mid-April at the end of the legislature’s session, House Republican Leader William Lamberth asked the U.S. Department of Education whether $1.1 billion in federal funds would be jeopardized by his bill, which would enable school districts to check students’ immigration status and charge tuition. 
Lamberth had not received a response as of May 19, and whether the House moves forward with the bill in January “depends on the response we receive,” House Republican Caucus spokesperson Jennifer Easton said Monday in response to questions from the Lookout.
The Senate version of the bill passed in this year’s session despite public outcry. But if Lamberth continues to push the measure in 2026 as he said he would, he’s likely to run into a conflict with Rep. Jeremy Faison, chairman of the Republican Caucus.










That being said, I still strongly oppose the state passing a bill that puts children, who have zero decision making power, in the middle of a legal battle.


– House Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison


Faison, of Cosby, told WBIR-TV’s “Inside Tennessee” he was a “big fat no” on the legislation and challenged the strategy of trying to put the measure before the U.S. Supreme Court, the Tennessee Journal reported.
Faison backed off his initial statement in which he called the bill a “political stunt,” saying he shouldn’t have questioned the motives of Lamberth, of Portland, and Sen. Bo Watson, of Hixson, who sponsored the bill.
“That being said, I still strongly oppose the state passing a bill that puts children, who have zero decision making power, in the middle of a legal battle,” Faison told the Lookout. 
The House version of the legislation would give school districts the option to check students to determine whether they have permanent legal documentation, differing from the Senate version, which would force districts to check students’ immigration status and require tuition.
Tennessee bill denying immigrant children right to an education dead for year

Faison said Monday he supports President Donald Trump’s efforts to secure the Southern border and wants to see Congress repair the nation’s immigration laws so states don’t have to debate policies dealing with federal issues. Yet, he said he never liked the bill dealing with immigrant students.
Faison reportedly said on WBIR that Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti told him the U.S. Supreme Court would never take up the immigrant student case, which was designed to overturn a 1982 decision that found all children should be allowed to enroll in public schools no matter their immigration status.
Federal Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origins in programs that receive federal funds, and violating the law could put the federal funds in danger, according to a state financial analysis. Those deal with the Every Student Succeeds Act — which measures student success —, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, the Carl Perkins Act — named for the late Kentucky Congressman Carl Perkins, it funds career and technical education — and school nutrition.

(Getty Images)On Tuesday, May 20, Idahoans have a unique opportunity to shape the future of their communities by voting in local library district elections. 
While these elections may not garner the same attention as national contests, their outcomes have profound and lasting impacts on education, access to information, and community development across the state. Service on a library district board of trustees is important work, and it matters who is elected to fill library board positions.
 Why Idaho’s library districts matter

There are currently 69 library districts in Idaho. Library districts in Idaho are independent units of government with their own taxing authority, separate from county commissioners. Library districts are responsible for setting budgets and policies, and ensuring that library services meet the varying needs of the members of their communities. 
In a geographically large state like Idaho, with vast rural areas, library districts are essential for public library development and the crucial services they provide. Many Idahoans, especially those in unincorporated or rural areas, rely on these districts for access to library services. Without them, residents might find themselves without adequate resources for education, job training, contact with medical providers, and digital access. 
 The stakes are high

Recent debates in Idaho have highlighted the importance of library governance. Discussions around book content, access to information, and the role of libraries in communities have become increasingly prominent. Library elections across Idaho have gained attention due to efforts to ban certain books, censor library programming that some community members disfavor, and dissolve a library district. 
These issues underscore the critical role that library trustees play in upholding the values of intellectual freedom, inclusivity, and community service.
Libraries are more than just buildings with books; they are community hubs that provide resources for learning, connection, and growth. By voting in your local library district elections, you have a say in how these vital institutions are run.
Don’t miss this opportunity to influence the future of your community. Head to the polls on May 20 and cast your vote for the candidates who reflect your vision for Idaho’s libraries.

World War II had ended, President Harry Truman sent former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to the nascent United Nations where she was elected chair to the UN Commission on Human Rights and the U.S. became one of the first signatories on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR).
Tennessee’s recent roundup operations in Nashville’s immigrant communities mark the state’s shameful turn away from core American values like human rights and constitutional protections.
ICE/THP roundups have left Tennessee communities reeling
Throughout the first two weeks of May, the Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) collaborated with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in hundreds of traffic stops in Nashville’s immigrant communities, apparently racially and ethnically targeting drivers. 
“By all appearances, government officials racially and ethnically profiled residents, requested driver’s licenses, inquired about tattoos, left cars abandoned on roadways creating traffic hazards, and tore at least one mother from her children,” read a letter signed by all but three of the Davidson County legislative delegation to the heads of Tennessee’s Department of Homeland Security and the Highway Patrol.
The law enforcement operations have led to around 588 traffic stops and 103 people being detained. Despite information requests from Mayor Freddie O’Connell and Davidson County’s lawmakers, state and federal officials have not been forthcoming on who has been detained, where the detainees are, whether they’ve been officially arrested or charged with a crime, and what will happen to them next.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement “dragnet” in Nashville results in detentions

These developments have been concerning to many because, before the Trump era, state and local authorities rarely enforced immigration law.
Tennessee’s Republican lawmakers put out statements supporting the raids. They are also the ones to thank for making these raids possible, because last year the Republican supermajority passed legislation making it easier for state law enforcement to work hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities. It’s also worth mentioning that, just in April of this year, the Tennessee General Assembly passed a bill that eliminated the Tennessee Human Rights Commission (THRC), which had safeguarded civil rights in the state since 1963.
Racially targeted dragnets violate human rights
One does not have to be an immigration rights advocate to be concerned about what’s happening in our communities. Detaining Tennessee residents for their skin color or for the neighborhood they live in violates their rights as enshrined in both the UDHR and the U.S. Constitution. 
The UDHR has 30 articles, but a few stand out today:
– Article 3: “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.”
– Article 9: “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.”
– Article 10: “Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him.”
– Article 14: “Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.”
These articles defend all humans from arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile while granting them the right to asylum and due process. Hispanic communities in Nashville are the descendants of families who left Latin America, often fleeing U.S. military intervention, CIA-backed covert operations and disastrous U.S.-led financial sanctions on their nations of origin. For these communities to be targeted again, this time on U.S. soil, is the height of cruelty.
The U.S. Constitution provides equal protection for all
The Constitution is even more explicit in the protections it offers to all persons residing in the U.S. Racial and ethnic profiling violate the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits discrimination based on race.
THP claimed their operations with ICE were justified because they were “…public safety operation[s] that targeted areas of suspected gang activity with a history of serious traffic crashes.” But even if that were true, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits racial discrimination even in communities with high crime rates. 
Quoting D.C.-based legislative attorney April J. Anderson, “The Equal Protection Clause’s prohibition on intentional racial discrimination remains true even if members of a given race are responsible for more crimes in a particular neighborhood or commit more crimes of a certain type. Even if the evidence showed that police relied on racial profiling out of a perhaps ill-conceived notion that it helped fight crime, the Equal Protection Clause prohibits intentionally relying on race in policing, no matter the underlying rationale for the policy.”
The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizure and requires individual justification for law enforcement actions. The word ‘individual’ is the key word there, as dragnets, roundups, and other group-focused law enforcement operations have often been successfully challenged as Fourth Amendment violations. Again quoting Anderson, “It [the Fourth Amendment] does not specifically prohibit racial profiling, but courts would not consider stops and searches based solely on a subject’s race to be reasonable seizures because police have identified no individualized reason for suspicion.”
Tennessee is at a turning point
Racial profiling and ethnically motivated law enforcement actions have a long, gruesome history in the U.S.. Yet from the “Show me your papers” scandal in Maricopa County, Arizona to the Stop and Frisk policy in New York City, landmark court decisions were made, justice prevailed, and the protections offered by the Constitution were again held aloft as the supreme law of the land.
Tennessee is at a turning point. Will it ally itself with a presidential administration that, as recently as May 9, floated suspending habeas corpus?  Recent events suggest Tennessee officials want to play ball with the Trump Administration. Tennesseans need to remind elected officials they work for us, not the feds, because if constitutional protections don’t apply to the most vulnerable of us, then they don’t apply to any of us.

(Getty Images)Last week, a federal judge ordered “full restoration” of services at the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. However, after the ruling, credit for getting those people back to work at NIOSH started going to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. — the man who eliminated the positions in the first place.
In her ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger said the federal Department of Health and Human Services could not legally end services with the surveillance program, and that doing so would “cost lives.”
In April, more than 200 jobs were eliminated at NIOSH as part of President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency Workforce Optimization Initiative, which aimed to reduce staffing at DHHS from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees. This affected the entire NIOSH facility in Morgantown, leaving no one in the United States who performs the same services for occupational safety and health, said Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3040.
“We do the research to make everyone’s job safer,” she said.
West Virginia U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito was the only member of the state’s Congressional delegation who spoke up against the job cuts. She requested a meeting with Kennedy, to ask him to bring back the NIOSH employees. 
Capito posted on X on the day of Berger’s ruling that, “The health and safety of our WV workers, including our miners, is of the utmost importance and I will always advocate for their wellbeing.”
Despite that comment, she’s not backing the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act that was introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine and Rep. Bobby Scott, who both represent Virginia. She’s not speaking out about delaying the Mine Safety and Health Administration rule that would have limited how much dangerous silica dust coal miners are exposed to while they work. She hasn’t supported federal legislation to increase monthly black lung benefits stipends for thousands of West Virginia coal miners and their families to keep up with rises in inflation.
On the same day as Berger’s ruling, job cuts were reversed for a Pittsburgh lab that certifies virtually all U.S. government-approved respirators in the country. When Pennsylvania Capitol-Star reporter Ian Karbal reached out to DHHS about the reversal, a spokesperson pointed to employees at the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program getting back to work. 
They gave the credit, however, to Kennedy and, of course, the Trump administration. 
“The Trump Administration remains committed to supporting coal miners, who play a vital role in America’s energy sector. Under Secretary [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]’s leadership, NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program will continue to meet the needs of our nation’s miners,” a spokesperson for DHHS wrote.
West Virginia U.S. Rep. Riley Moore — who eventually began to care about the job cuts in Morgantown — credited himself and Kennedy for good news.
“This is a great win for West Virginia, and I can’t thank the Secretary enough for working closely with my office to make this happen,” Moore posted on X. “The work NIOSH does is critically important for our coal miners and their safety.”

This is a great win for West Virginia, and I can’t thank the Secretary enough for working closely with my office to make this happen. The work NIOSH does is critically important for our coal miners and their safety. https://t.co/ztXeLsnwVr
— Rep. Riley M. Moore (@RepRileyMoore) May 14, 2025

But that’s not what happened. 
The NIOSH employees only got their jobs back because Berger ruled it was illegal to end the program. And she heard from NIOSH employees and the case’s lead plaintiff, a coal miner named Harry Wiley, who presented “overwhelming evidence” that the work had been stopped — not just paused — without any plans or efforts in place to ensure it continued as mandated by Congress.
Mine safety and health lawyer Sam Brown Petsonk worked with Mountain State Justice and Appalachian Mountain Advocates to file Wiley v. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., et al. 
Petsonk found Wiley, a coal miner who was diagnosed with black lung in November, to testify and lead the case. Wiley asked to use Part 90, which allows workers diagnosed with black lung to transfer to a less dusty part of a mine without facing retribution from a mine operator. To qualify, miners must have their black lung testing results certified by NIOSH. But those employees were all placed on administrative leave on April 1, leaving no one to approve his application or offer him free screenings to verify his claims.
“As the testimony before the Court made clear, that dust exposure will cause [Wiley’s] disease to progress until it becomes debilitating. Does [Kennedy] genuinely believe that a miner diagnosed with black lung is not being injured when the program designed to confirm his condition and provide him with workplace protections to prevent its progression is rendered inaccessible?” Berger wrote. “This Court does not share such a belief.”
Wiley risked the possibility of facing unofficial social reprimands from the coal mine he works at. He should feel insulted that people are thanking Kennedy — Kennedy didn’t make the decision to put NIOSH employees back to work, Berger did.
Our elected and appointed officials with one lone exception sat back while the government attempted to rob coal miners of the congressionally mandated rights their predecessors fought for. And those miners fight every day to survive an incurable disease without their help.
When you see campaign ads featuring coal miners start to circulate on TV next election, remember where this credit really belongs. Remember who actually fought for our coal miners.
Capito and Moore should be thanking Berger, Petsonk and Wiley for getting some NIOSH employees back to work. And they should be working to get the rest of the employees back on the job permanently as well. The mining research team in Pennsylvania is still on “temporary” administrative leave. This isn’t the end of the fight.

CENTRAL CITY — Pastor Jennifer Banks was still a relative newcomer to this Western Kentucky town on the night in September when she watched  through a security camera as a police officer brought a woman in a wheelchair to the church and “dumped her in our parking lot.” 
Banks’ husband, Zachary, rushed to the church in time to talk to the officer. 
“He’s like, ‘Man, I’m sorry. We didn’t have anywhere for her to go. We knew that y’all wouldn’t trespass her here, and we didn’t want to see her go to jail,” Zachary Banks recalls.
Mallie Luken, 70, a widow, was down to her last few dollars. She had asked her former pastor to drive her from the nearby county where she was living to Muhlenberg County because she remembered an old ad for the Central Inn, a motel in Central City, and thought she could afford a night there.
Jennifer Banks had met Mallie Luken the day before after getting a call from police about a “homeless woman” outside Arby’s. The officer told the pastor the woman had trespassed on multiple properties and asked if she could do something.

Banks gathered a plate of food and headed to Arby’s. She found Luken sitting outside in a wheelchair next to her dog Blaze. They prayed together. At that time, Banks had yet to consider using the Abundant Life Church as a shelter. The congregation was barely a year old and still buying the building from the Central City government. 
“I had to leave her there, because I didn’t have anywhere for her to go. And then the next day was when they dumped her in our parking lot,” Jennifer Banks said. 
Banks’ community was ill-prepared to respond to that kind of housing emergency. That realization has served as a catalyst for the Bankses and others in Muhlenberg County who want to fill gaps they see in services and housing. They have met resistance and support, as the Lantern will report over the next few days.
But on that night eight months ago, all Zachary Banks could do was take Luken a blanket.
She stayed there on the pavement under a stainless steel table, an experience made even worse because she was separated from Blaze after he bolted from an earlier thunder clap. As storms rolled through Luken thought of her parents. “To know that that’s your child laying under a stainless steel table,” Luken said. “I could have gotten electrocuted.” 
Looking back recently, she said, “I just didn’t care if I woke up in the morning,” mentioning how worried she was about Blaze. Luken thinks her search for the dog had prompted more calls to police about trespassing.
Seeing Luken in the parking lot, Zachary Banks thought of his mother. “It just broke my heart to see her just dumped out there and for us to not be able to have any resources to be able to do anything.” 
  Word got around that the parking lot at Abundant Life Church is a safe place to sleep without fear of arrest for trespassing. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony) IS THAT THE SHOWER?
An officer wrote in an email to church leaders that Luken was dropped off at the church at her request and that the local police department “currently does not have any type of resources to assist her.” The officer in his email asked the church for assistance to make sure Luken didn’t get into further legal trouble. 
Zachary Banks said he urged the officer to “stand up” for the church before the Central City city council and for the work the church was doing to help people experiencing homelessness. The officer told Zachary Banks he would try.

Luken soon found shelter thanks to help from Gwen Clements. Using money given by a concerned neighbor of the church, Clements checked Luken into the Central Inn. Within about a week, calling around to her connections, Clements found Luken an apartment at the public housing authority in Greenville, the Muhlenberg County seat. 
She contacted Luken’s daughter in North Carolina who wasn’t aware of her situation and learned the mother and daughter have a strained relationship. 
Luken was united with Blaze, and they are still together.
In a rural county with few resources for people without shelter, Clements is part of a loose coalition of people who see a growing need to help those experiencing homelessness. Clements grew up in Muhlenberg County and believes it is not unlike other rural communities suffering a shortage of housing. 
‘I feel for these people’
Earlier in 2024, Clements had started a Facebook group to advocate for more resources to help people struggling to secure a safe place to live. Clements, who moved back to Central City in the early 2000s, had a vision for what she wanted for the county: a community space that could serve as a warming center, shelter and kitchen, largely inspired by efforts of a nonprofit in Somerset. 
“In this county, if they would just open up more affordable housing. Most of the problems would be eliminated,” Clements said. “If we had public transportation for people to get the documents they need — nobody wants to take these people so that they can get the hand up and get on with their lives just by having a few pieces of paper in hand.”

Clements says her own experiences make her want to help. “I feel for these people. I’ve been in their situation, not knowing where I was gonna go next,” Clements told the Lantern earlier this year. “I want to be the person I needed during my dark times. I want to give hope to those who feel hopeless, show them someone cares about their needs.” 
“Sometimes it’s draining. Sometimes I leave my house at seven o’clock in the morning and don’t come back till it’s dark,” Clements said. “If you’re making a commitment, you gotta follow that commitment through till you’re done.” 

“While homelessness is often considered an urban issue, the number of unsheltered homeless individuals has rapidly risen outside of Lexington and Louisville, going from six hundred fifty (650) in 2019 to more than one thousand (1,000) in 2024.
“While homelessness has many causes, the Deputy Executive Director of Housing Programs for the Kentucky Housing Corporation stated that the lack of housing was a contributing factor, likening the housing situation to a game of musical chairs where certain people would simply be left out due to the lack of supply. 
“Those already vulnerable to homelessness, including seniors, people with disabilities, and those with low income, could be pushed into homelessness as a result of the housing shortage and rising home prices and rents.”

She helps people fill out birth certificate requests so they can get an identification card. Her Facebook group has become a clearinghouse connecting people who say they need help to those who want to provide it. She often fields several messages a day asking for food, clothing or enough money to stay at a local motel. Sometimes people she helps are dealing with unstable housing situations, getting close to the precipice of living without shelter. 
Some who need help grapple with addiction and other mental health issues. Some work or struggle to find work, having limited or no transportation to get them to a job. The county has a limited supply of affordable rentals amid a worsening housing shortage that is common across rural Kentucky. 
“Housing as a whole is very hard to come by, whether it’s affordable, whether it’s appropriate, whether it’s up to code, whether or not they get in there. I mean, it’s just hard all the way around,” said Kelsey Rolley, a services coordinator at Pennyrile Allied Community Services in Greenville. “It’s that much harder when you’re in a position like mine, where people come to you for help and then you don’t have any resources to refer them to, or you don’t have the means to be able to help immediately at that moment.”
Muhlenberg County, once bolstered by coal mining and famous for producing musicians, has an aging and declining population similar to other rural communities. Poverty rates are higher than the national and state averages, according to the U.S. Census. Central City has a population of a little more than 6,000 residents. About 1 in 4 of them live in poverty.
Michael Howard, the CEO of the regional ARCH Community Health Coalition in Western Kentucky, said finding a way forward beyond coal mining has been difficult and the housing shortage makes fostering new industries and jobs even more challenging. But, he said, the vast majority in Muhlenberg County would reply “No” when asked if homelessness is a local problem.
“They don’t realize that they’re already there. You know, they’re invisible,” Howard said. 
They’re not invisible to everyone, though. Next in the Lantern’s series: Jennifer and Zachary Banks and Abundant Life Church have a plan, backed by others in the loose coalition.

Driving from the Lantern’s office in Frankfort to my house in Lexington, I’m often snagged by a couple of red lights, where I avoid eye contact with the person standing on the corner holding a cardboard sign asking for money.
One of the luxuries of city life, I suppose, is keeping some people no closer than your peripheral vision — and thoughts.
That luxury is less available in small towns, where the person on the street is not anonymous but someone you once worked beside on the line at the poultry plant. Or someone who reminds you of your child or mother. Or someone who’s sleeping in your church’s parking lot.
Today we begin a series of stories from one such Kentucky place.
It’s a small place that looms large in the imagination because of its musical heritage. It inspired John Prine to sing “Oh, daddy, won’t you take me back to Muhlenberg County” in his anti strip-mining anthem “Paradise.” Not much more than 30 miles from the cradle of bluegrass music, Bill Monroe’s Rosine, Muhlenberg County contributed a guitar style — thumb-picking — made famous by native son Merle Travis, who also wrote the GOAT of coal mining songs: “You load 16 tons, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt.” Don and Phil Everly — the chart-topping Everly Brothers — trace their lineage to Central City.

Muhlenberg County is not extraordinary, though, in another respect: The struggle to come to terms with what it owes the people who many of us (me included) conveniently keep on the far outskirts of our minds. I’m confident we’d find similar stories and conflicts across Kentucky, in state capitols and all the way to the debates raging right now in Washington, D.C.
These very personal stories introduce us to people who don’t avoid eye contact, who see the “campers” and couch surfers and evicted as neighbors. And, most emphatically, not as eyesores or threats.
These stories are about a shortage of services and housing, made worse by a surplus of untreated addiction and trauma.
Reporter Liam Niemeyer and I are sorry that some officials were unwilling to talk to him. Liam reached out via email, phone messages and dropping by. And it’s not too late. Their perspectives are important; we need to hear them, especially those of people who hold elected office. I recognize that solutions are not obvious, simple or inexpensive.
We are able to tell such intimate stories because Liam has spent a lot of time getting to know the people and the place. We weren’t sure what the story would be in the summer of 2023 when, pursuing an idea sparked by a report in a local newspaper, Liam spent a day with several people in Muhlenberg County who lacked housing. He also began to meet local people who wanted to help. As he stayed in touch by phone and in person, we knew we had a story worth telling even as we wrestled with how to tell it.
I hope you will find our efforts worthwhile as you meet Mallie and Gwen, Courtney and Jennifer, Zachary and the cantankerous but lovably philosophical John Paul.
We hope these personal stories will inform and inspire policy discussions and the search for solutions.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/muhlenberg2_46-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-20 06:01:20.058939

Roy Wilson State Hall to commemorate what would have been Malcolm X’s 100th birthday. 
It was held in the Malcolm X Auditorium with around 75 people in attendance, the event based on the question: Should the Black community prioritize investing in local grassroots organizations over supporting Black political figures in office?
Umoja Debate League is a nonprofit organization “that uses debate as our vehicle to teach Detroit youth ages 11-18 transferable life skills, such as critical thinking, confidence, conflict resolution, increased literacy, and self-expression,” according to its website.

The event opened with remarks from Wayne State University professor Dr. Kefentse Chike, who talked about the historical importance of the room and Malcolm’s evolution from Malcolm Little to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. 
“His life was short, but powerfully transformative,” he said, talking about Malcolm’s lasting impact on movements from the Black Panther Party to Black Lives Matter.

Malcolm X was born on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska. He spent his youth in Michigan, living in Lansing after his family moved there in the 1920s. He spoke at Wayne State University in 1963. Malcolm X was assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York City.
The debate reflected key themes of self-determination, accountability, and collective action—values that were the most important to Malcolm X’s legacy.
Debaters Laila Sanford-McKisic and Kyla Canty of Renaissance High School argued in favor of grassroots investment, and Mamboge Njie of Renaissance High and D’Maiya Clark of Detroit School of Arts emphasized the importance of political power. 
“I want to make it very clear that this is not an either-or conversation; this is about strategy, about timing, about balancing where the money goes,” Njie said.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

Among the dictates: limits on shower lengths and toilet flushes and no games, no fun, and no kids in the house.
The ad and its amusing absurdity probably came to mind for anyone who had seen it as they watched last week’s action in the North Carolina House of Representatives.
Everyone knows that legislative bodies must operate under a set of parliamentary rules and procedures. After all, maintaining order in a large group of opinionated and talkative politicians is no easy feat, and without rules governing things like how committees will operate, who can speak and when, and which motions will be considered and in what order, the potential for chaotic disorder is high.

That said, when the rules become Saban-like – that is, so numerous, complex and restrictive that they make majority rule effectively impossible — they’ve gone too far and, as is explained below, that’s the case right now in the North Carolina House of Representatives.
What is a rule?
Interestingly, the idea of what constitutes a “rule,” when it will apply, and how it will be enacted and enforced is somewhat flexible and has evolved down through the decades.
In the U.S House of Representatives, there are rules that govern the basics of House operations, but there are also “special rules” that govern the consideration of individual bills and resolutions that are the province of the powerful Rules Committee.
Thus, while a bill can go directly to a floor vote after being approved by a substantive committee like, say, Education and Workforce, the common practice is for the Rules Committee to serve as the next step in the process. Operating as a gatekeeper, it will decide whether to issue a special “rule” that determines things like when the bill will be heard and how much time will be allotted for debate.
Across the nation, many state legislatures have their own versions of this set-up. In North Carolina, both the Senate and House have Rules Committees that have come to resemble the U.S. House version in recent years. While neither go to the trouble of issuing special “rules” to govern a bill’s consideration, in practice, both do act as gatekeepers, appendages of leadership, and the final arbiters of whether a bill will make it to the floor.
NC GOP lawmakers add more rules
With such an arrangement, you’d think Republican legislative leaders would feel secure in their ability to exert complete control over all details of the legislative process. As was made plain last week, however, as state House leaders rolled out their new state budget proposal in a series of appropriations subcommittee meetings and, at least in theory, opened it up to debate and amendment, that’s not the case.
As it turns out, the lengthy and detailed provisions of the existing House Rules – all of which were written and enacted by the GOP majority – were deemed insufficient. Instead, appropriations subcommittee chairs all commenced their meetings last week by unveiling yet another long list of new, additional and restrictive rules handed down from some unknown place that made the consideration of meaningful amendments all but impossible.
Somewhere, the Nick Saban commercial character was smiling.
Among the prohibitions:

no amendments to spend additional dollars were allowed unless they reduced another line item from a very restricted list by the same amount,
no amendments to increase overall spending,
no amendments that include Hurricane Helene related items,
no amendment dealing with fees,
no amendments to reduce or eliminate vacant positions (or the associated savings in salary and benefits).

What’s more all of these prohibitions were sprung on Democratic lawmakers as they entered the room and saw hundreds of pages of proposed law changes and spending items for the first time. They were allotted an hour or two to draft amendments.
Talk about no fun and no kids in the house.
Politics and appearances
Of course, as with so many restrictive legislative rules, the purpose of the new prohibitions has more to do with politics and appearances than dictating outcomes. Republicans have the votes to do whatever they want when it comes to passing legislation; what they designed the new rules to help them avoid was the possibility that they might have to go on the record in doing so.
Better to rule an amendment “out of order” pursuant to a restrictive rule, goes the thinking, than to risk casting a public “no” vote on something popular and logical like, say, a Democratic proposal to strengthen schools, help businesses devastated by Helene, or cancel a planned $2 million expenditure for moving the State Board of Elections into the building that houses its new overseer, state Auditor Dave Boliek.
The bottom line: In representative government, the majority is supposed to rule.

According to the National Institute for Early Education Research’s State of Preschool Yearbook, Virginia has dropped by three spots to 26th in the country in offering preschool access for 3-year-olds, but maintained its 30th place ranking for preschool access for 4-year-olds.
Last year, nearly 10,000 parents in the commonwealth were seeking early childhood care and education services, primarily in the southern and central regions. However, Virginia has made strides enrolling an additional 824 students to its Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) and Mixed Delivery programs.
VPI is offered for free for four-year-old children and Mixed Delivery offers funding to private, community-based preschools to serve children at risk of entering school without the necessary skills.
Angela Mancipe, a parent of two from Chesterfield County, said finding a preschool spot for her oldest child during the pandemic was a challenge for her and her husband, considering the waitlist amid nationwide health concerns. While her son was able to land a spot six months later, Mancipe’s life changed after losing her job and becoming pregnant with her daughter, who was also able to be enrolled in a preschool program.
Mancipe recently accepted a part-time assistant teacher position at her daughter’s preschool to help bring in some income, which is housed within a church daycare. She’s fearful of losing her daughter’s spot, saying that when they were first searching for a preschool for her, some of their calls went unanswered. Like many families, the cost of their children’s care and early education is also a persistent challenge.
“It’s insane how much it costs to have your child in daycare,” Mancipe said. “We are very fortunate when it comes to being able to even live off of one income, but to pay double your mortgage to have your children in a safe and well cared for facility with good providers where they’ll get quality care and education, it shouldn’t be double your mortgage.”
 The state of early childhood education in Virginia

The National Institute for Early Education Research said in a statement that state initiatives “propelled” early childhood education in the United States to “historic highs” during the 2023-2024 school year, as preschools recovered from the impacts of the pandemic. 
“Yet, progress has been highly uneven from state to state. While many states advanced by enrolling more children in quality preschool, others lagged, funding no preschool or only low quality programs,” researchers stated. “As federal cutbacks in education and elsewhere are being implemented, it is notable that federal COVID-19 recovery funding played a crucial role in sustaining and advancing preschool, and other federal funds underpin state programs and decrease inequality among the states in access to quality preschool education.”
According to the report, the institute determined the commonwealth’s Virginia Preschool Initiative (VPI) program met five of the 10 quality standard benchmarks, and Mixed Delivery programs, which offer services for infants to preschoolers, met four out of 10. 
Virginia met the benchmarks for both programs by conducting a process to observe student and teacher behaviors in the classroom, meeting the staff-to-child ratio of 1:10 for 3- and 4-year-olds, and following a “comprehensive, aligned, supported and culturally sensitive” set of development standards.
The programs fell short of the requirements, including: that the lead teacher must have a minimum of a bachelor’s degree and specialized training in Pre-K; the assistant teacher must have a minimum of a Child Development Associate (CDA) degree; and the teachers must receive at least 15 hours per year of in-service professional development and training, individualized annual professional development plans and coaching.
Allison Gilbreath, senior director of policy and programs at Voices for Virginia’s Children, said in a statement to the Mercury that the report indicating the decline in preschool access is concerning, given that Virginia’s two preschool programs enrolled nearly 25,000 children last year.
“Investments in four-year-old classrooms are important — but they’re only one piece of the puzzle,” Gilbreath said. “To truly support families and providers, we need a coordinated early childhood system that strengthens access and sustainability across all age groups. A holistic approach is essential to meet the needs of children from birth to five.”
With the uncertainty regarding the national climate lawmakers and advocates are concerned that federal government funding cuts could jeopardize other early childhood care and education initiatives. 
“I am very concerned that progress made at the state level could be affected by cuts at the federal level,” said Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax. “Early childhood care and education sets the foundation for years of learning and becoming a productive member of society. It is an investment worth protecting and expanding.”
Bulova carried a successful budget amendment to address the early childhood care and education program waitlist in January. Although the amendment did not eliminate the waitlist for the programs entirely, Bulova said it did make significant progress by reducing the Child Care Subsidy Program (CCSP) waitlist by 5,437 since the start of the year.
The waitlist currently stands at 3,278.
Mancipe said she and other parents appreciate the legislature’s work but would like to see it go further. One area she recommended lawmakers continue to address is creating a stable, adequate funding for childcare to support families and providers due to the high costs and staffing shortages.
“We are very thankful for their commitment for what they are doing and the efforts they are making,” Mancipe said. “I think we still have a long way to go.”
 Next steps

During this year’s two-month legislative session, the General Assembly and Gov. Glenn Youngkin approved proposals directing the state to develop a plan for mental health screenings and services for children under the age of 5, clarifying how publicly funded early childhood programs are excluded from specific oversight requirements and expanding the Early Childhood Care and Education Commission by one member, bringing the total to 32. 
The commission is tasked with providing recommendations for and tracking progress on financing Virginia’s comprehensive birth-to-five early childhood care and education system, or VQB5, to improve children’s school readiness and expand access to parents and support providers.
Lawmakers attempted to launch a $25 million Employee Child Care Assistance Pilot Program to expand access to childcare. However the amendment to the biennium budget measure was vetoed by Youngkin earlier this month.
Youngkin said while the commonwealth has made “historical investments” in early learning and child care this biennium, the effort is best considered “in a bill and at a smaller scale to determine program effectiveness and scalability.”
Another failed measure would have strengthened incentives for childcare providers to remain open during “nontraditional” working hours to better serve health care professionals, hospitality workers, first responders, military families, and others with unique needs, said Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, who carried the bill.
“There was strong interest in this bill, but it did not advance due to the fiscal impact. We’ll return to this issue in the future,” Hernandez said in a statement to the Mercury.
Other proposals that failed to pass during the short session earlier this year would have increased funding for kindergarten readiness programs, expanded child care to certain qualifying child care providers at no charge and improved retention and recruitment of child care educators designating them as a priority group for the CCSP. 
Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, who carried the retention bill, said as a mother of a 2-year-old she understands the challenge of finding affordable, quality childcare. 
“I want all Virginia families to be able to access affordable, quality early childhood education and care from birth. While we are not there yet, we have also made a lot of progress,” Bennett Parker said in a statement. 
She said one area the NIEER report does not cover is the additional 1,000 subsidy slots lawmakers added over two years in the biennium budget.
 Preserving Head Start equals ‘investing in our future’

One program that concerns advocates and lawmakers is Head Start. This program aims to provide all-inclusive education, health, and nutrition services to children whose families fall below the federal poverty line, which is currently around $30,000 for a family of four.
However, on Wednesday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. testified that President Donald Trump’s budget would not eliminate the program. Yet some regional offices have been closed and funding has been frozen.
“Protecting and expanding Head Start is a foundational investment,” said Dawn Ault, executive director of the Virginia Head Start Association. “Any reduction or disruption would create childcare deserts where working parents would face impossible choices: leaving the workforce, relying on unreliable care, or falling into deeper financial hardship.”
Head Start was also one of the programs recommended to be eliminated by the authors of Project 2025, a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican won the recent presidential election. In 2021, the authors wrote that the program negatively affected children and that the federal government should  discontinue it. 
However, Ault said an investment in Head Start benefits families and taxpayers. According to the Virginia Head Start Association, Virginia offers 52 Head Start and Early Head Start programs. 
“For every $1 invested in Head Start, we see up to $9 in long-term returns,” Ault said. “That’s not frivolous spending — it’s smart, conservative investing in our future.”

Primary season begins as early voting kicks off Friday and Virginians start shaping the 2025 ballot

The common logic is that you steer as far as you can to the right (for Republicans) or left (among Democrats) to rouse their base voters until they’re ready to chew barbed wire and spit out roofing nails.
Then, after the preseason scrimmage is over, it’s time to tack back toward the center — where the dispositive mass of Virginia’s electorate has repeatedly proved it resides — and, if you still can, appear less the wild-eyed zealot and more the measured, moderate and sane candidate of November.
But something weird is happening this year: folks with no primary opponent seem locked in primary mode, especially within the GOP, where the statewide nominations are already settled.
On the Democratic side, the only statewide candidate without a primary fight is former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who has a bye into the November governor’s election. She and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is unopposed for the Republican nomination, will contend for history’s distinction as the first woman governor in Virginia’s more than 400 years.
There are a half-dozen Democrats — state Sens. Aaron Rouse of Virginia Beach and Ghazala Hashmi of Chesterfield County, former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, Prince William County School Board member Babur Lateef, lawyer and labor leader Alex Bastani and career federal prosecutor Victor Salgado — vying for lieutenant governor. None are known statewide and it’s anyone’s guess where that roulette ball lands. The victor will take on Republican John Reid, Virginia’s first openly gay statewide nominee who survived a homophobic attempt to blackmail him off the ticket that backfired spectacularly on the top echelon of Virginia’s GOP.
The GOP’s disgraceful bid to sandbag its openly gay lieutenant governor nominee

In the Democrats’ attorney general sweepstakes, Jay Jones, a former assistant attorney general in the District of Columbia and former House of Delegates member from Norfolk, is battling Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. The winner will oppose Republican Jason Miyares, who is running for reelection.
The GOP nominees have the luxury of sniping at these down-ticket Democrats as they go after one another hammer and tongs until the June 17 primary. But the Democrats share a unifying theme. Each promises to shield Virginia from the varied predations of the Trump White House, whether it be reproductive or LGBTQ rights, mass layoffs of Virginia’s large federal workforce or protecting Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health care for the poor.
Va. GOP congressman’s scrutiny on federal cuts, job losses needs company from other Republicans

That messaging is unlikely to change much after the primary, with good reason: Trump is historically toxic in Virginia. Every time he has either been in office or on the ballot, Republicans have paid the price in Virginia elections.
Trump himself is 0-3 in the commonwealth, losing to Hillary Clinton by 5 percentage points in 2016, Joe Biden by 10 in 2020, and Kamala Harris last November by 6.
Beginning in 2015 — when he descended the golden escalator into the lobby of his eponymous Manhattan skyscraper to announce his first presidential bid — and for the next five years, Virginia Republicans lost. They lost majorities in the state’s U.S. House delegation. They lost every election for statewide office. They lost control of the House of Delegates and the Virginia Senate.
By 2020, Democrats owned every statewide lever of elective political power in Virginia for the first time since 1968.
As soon as Trump was gone, GOP fortunes improved. In 2021, Republicans swept all three statewide executive offices and retook the House of Delegates majority. The ticket was led by Glenn Youngkin, a wealthy former hedge fund executive running for governor in the first election of his life as a fresh-faced, kinder, gentler Republican who judiciously distanced himself from Trump but is now a reliable Trump lieutenant.
Now, Trump is back, and if you thought the first term gave Virginia Democrats plenty to chew on, version 2.0 — supercharged by modern-day Croesus and chainsaw-wielding grim reaper of livelihoods Elon Musk — serves up a banquet.
And that puts this year’s GOP slate in a pickle.
Sure, they’re free to make Democrats account for years of out-of-control federal spending, and a border and immigration policy that the party couldn’t or wouldn’t address when it had the chance. Yes, the GOP is advancing the attack — as it has done for years, and with considerable success last year — that violent crime is on the rise (it’s not) and that “illegals” are driving it (they’re certainly not).
But what they’ve been unwilling to do so far, even though there are no nomination battles to wage, is put distance between themselves and Trump.
Republican candidates who were once stalwart globalist free-traders now sit either in meek acquiescence or voice throaty support for daunting tariffs the president has imposed unilaterally without the concurrence of Congress.
Not one has registered a notable protest over Trump unleashing Musk to eviscerate the federal workforce and curb federal government contracts, even though Northern Virginia has the richest concentration of them in the world with the possible exception of its nextdoor neighbor, the District of Columbia.
These candidates sit mute as the president openly defies the 14th Amendment to the Constitution which guarantees citizenship to all persons born on U.S. soil. They turn blind eyes when masked, unbadged federal agents, without warrants, arrest foreigners — both those here legally and illegally — and try to hustle them outside our borders, often without the due process of law.
Those aren’t conservative vs. liberal issues. Those have been foundational principles of our republic for nearly 250 years! They’re as elemental as our right to face our accusers in court, the right to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into our homes, the right to free speech and religion and the right to keep and bear arms.
But they dare not dispute their president who holds a death grip on what was once the Republican Party and now presumes a measure of almost imperial authority, unbounded by the courts, the Constitution, Congress — and certainly not centuries-old norms of decency and civility. They need look no farther into history than former Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., for a sobering lesson on the consequences of displeasing Trump.
Good, however, was felled in last year’s 5th Congressional District primary by Trump acolyte John McGuire. As Reid convincingly proved, the 2025 GOP statewide ticket is locked in, there are no primaries, and it’s time to move on.
Knowing that, let’s see if Republicans Earle-Sears, Reid and Miyares can reconnect with their party’s longtime creed and muster the character it takes to speak frankly about what Virginia voters — including persuadable moderates and more than a few Republicans — already recognize as the Trump administration’s gross abuses.
That would be so refreshing. It’s also the only hope the GOP has for avoiding a Virginia wipeout this November.

(Getty image)Last week saw the publication of two assessments of what’s wrong with child welfare in Rhode Island. Both missed the point.
On May 12, Kayla David, a vice president of a foster care agency, wrote a commentary for Rhode Island Current suggesting foster parents need more support in order to improve recruitment and retention because, she said, there’s a shortage of such parents.
The next day the state’s “Child Advocate” released a report that included some of the most horrifying cases of child abuse in Rhode Island since 2019. Some of the solutions offered were useful, such as bolstering drug treatment. But many of them were not, such as building more institutions. The Rhode Island House Committee on Oversight is scheduled to hear a presentation on the report on Wednesday.
In both cases, the authors ignored the elephant in the room, the problem at the root of all the others: Rhode Island’s fanatical devotion to tearing apart families. 
We know this because of something else that happened last week: The federal government released its most recent report showing how many children each state forced into foster care. As has been the case for decades, Rhode Island is an extreme outlier. Its rate-of-removal is more than double the national average when rates of child poverty are factored in.
Who are these children? Were they horrifically abused? In rare cases, yes. But in most cases: not even close.
In 87% of cases in which Rhode Island children were forced into foster care, there was not even an allegation of sexual abuse or any form of physical abuse. In 59% of cases, there was not even an allegation of any form of drug or alcohol abuse — not just no allegation of the horrific drug abuse cited by the Child Advocate, no allegation of any substance abuse of any kind.
David’s commentary portrayed foster parents as saviors, rescuing children who, until they came along, couldn’t sleep through the night, never heard laughter and were never listened to. But there also are many other foster children who cry through the night desperate to return to the parents they loved – and laughed with – and who desperately love them back; children who, even years after being reunited may dive under the bed or try to hide in the closet whenever there is a loud knock on the door for fear that they will be taken again; children taken because that family’s poverty was confused with neglect; taken because of what David herself called “unmet needs.”
Given the circumstances under which most children come into care it’s no wonder study after study finds that, in typical cases, children typically fare better in their own homes than with their erstwhile saviors.
So take another look and see if you can spot that elephant: Rhode Island does not have too few foster parents; Rhode Island has too many foster children. If Rhode Island took away children at a rate no worse than the national average, hundreds of spaces would open up in existing foster homes. 
And if caseworkers were not deluged with false reports, trivial cases, poverty cases and needless foster care they would have more time to investigate every case properly and be more likely to spot those relatively few children in real danger in time.










Take another look and see if you can spot that elephant: Rhode Island does not have too few foster parents; Rhode Island has too many foster children.


The solutions are not that complicated. Even small amounts of additional cash to ameliorate the worst effects of poverty significantly reduce what agencies call “neglect.” So imagine how much of this neglect we could eliminate if birth parents received $1,050 to $2,850 per-month per-child, tax-free. Because that’s what Rhode Island foster parents are getting to take care of those children, plus Medicaid coverage for each foster child, even “birthday and holiday stipends” – which begs the question: Would you want a child placed with someone who won’t buy that child a birthday present without the state paying for it?
Children can be taken from their own impoverished parents for inadequate supervision. Yet all foster parents, regardless of income, qualify for Rhode Island’s Child Care Assistance Program for any foster child under age 13.
The best foster parents know this. In her book, Memoirs of a Babystealer, Maine foster and adoptive parent Mary Callahan writes that almost every child she fostered could have remained safely in their own homes if their own parents had gotten the assistance she got as a foster mother.
As for the children with extraordinary behavioral health needs, the worst thing to do is to keep institutionalizing them as the Child Advocate’s report suggests. Instead, invest in wraparound programs that bring intensive help right into a family’s home or, when placement is really needed, a foster home.
But none of that is likely to happen until, at long last, someone in power in Rhode Island says: “Would you look at that? There’s an elephant in the room!”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)As they consider laws to encourage more housing this year, New Hampshire lawmakers have so far been more interested in the stick than the carrot. 
The Legislature has pushed forward a number of bills intended to overhaul zoning procedures that housing advocates say impede badly needed development. Some bills, such as ones to help expand accessory dwelling units and allow for “mixed-use” developments in commercial zones, represent the biggest state-driven changes to zoning laws in years.
But lawmakers are less focused on another policy tool: financial incentives. In its version of the budget, the House has stripped out funding for a program designed to encourage cities and towns to voluntarily change their zoning codes to be more housing friendly.
Now, pro-housing groups are pushing the Senate to restore at least some of that funding, arguing the zoning changes are only one piece of the puzzle. And the New Hampshire Municipal Association — which broadly opposes any bills that would override local zoning codes — argues financial incentives for towns should be the state’s sole approach. 
The Senate Finance Committee has an opportunity this month to dramatically reverse some of the House’s cuts. The Senate has already passed independent bills that together include $90 million of spending on housing — all of which could be added into the budget if desired. 
But the Senate is also grappling with projections suggesting lower-than-ideal business tax revenues, suggesting that it can restore some, but not all, of the House’s budget cuts in April. In total, the House cut $643 million from Ayotte’s budget; revenue projections from the Senate Ways and Means Committee suggest the body could restore only about half of that spending. 
An absence of funding
Nick Taylor, director of Housing Action New Hampshire, an advocacy group, notes the House-passed budget contains no new funding going toward affordable housing development. 
The House defunded the Housing Champion Program, which provides special grants to towns and cities that change their zoning codes to meet certain standards deemed friendlier to housing development. Under the program, towns that do so can receive state assistance for infrastructure funding and per-unit production grants.
Eighteen towns qualified in 2024, according to the New Hampshire Department of Business and Economic Affairs: Boscawen, Concord, Derry, Dover, Enfield, Farmington, Hinsdale, Hooksett, Jaffrey, Keene, Lebanon, Manchester, Nashua, Newport, Portsmouth, Rochester, Salem, and Somersworth.
Ayotte’s budget did not continue funding the program, which first passed in 2023. Instead, it extended the lapse date for the $5 million appropriated in 2023, allowing more time for the existing money to be distributed. But the House’s budget would end the program and redirect the unspent money.
House lawmakers also rejected proposals by Housing Action NH and others to increase the amount of funding going to the state’s affordable housing program — which helps to finance affordable housing projects — from $5 million per year to $10 million, and to double a tax credit program that funds the state’s Community Development Finance Authority from $5 million a year to $10 million. 
For lawmakers to focus only on zoning and not financing is a mistake, Taylor says. 
“Relaxing the regulatory piece is a big deal when it comes to allowing for more attainable market-rate options like (accessory dwelling units), like mixed-use development, (and) manufactured housing. But when you really get to the deeply affordable levels, you need the financing piece there too. And that is in danger of being left out of the equation this session.”
Brodie Deshaies, legislative advocate for the New Hampshire Municipal Association, agrees that more funding should be devoted to allow municipalities to craft pro-housing zoning codes that work for their residents. 
But the Municipal Association deviates from pro-housing groups by strongly opposing any state-passed laws to force cities and towns to change zoning.
“It seems zoning mandates are a priority, and that has no guarantee of more affordable housing, more workforce housing, even more housing in general,” he said in an interview. “Just because you’ve mandated that a municipality can’t have a specific zoning ordinance … what is a (landowner’s) incentive to build or to work with a developer to build?”
He added: “In the current Legislature, we’re seeing no collaborative process, no willingness to work with municipalities,” he said. “Instead, it seems very (strongly) working against municipalities.” 
Deshaies also predicted that though concern over the state’s housing crisis dominates New Hampshire polls, many residents will not like the zoning laws when they apply to their own towns. 
“I think a lot of residents and municipalities are going to look and say, ‘When I thought more housing, I was not thinking this,’” he said. 
A focus on regulations
Republican lawmakers who are pro-housing offer a different perspective. To them, the financial incentives championed by Housing Action and the Municipal Association are much less important than the regulatory reforms.
Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican and the chairman of the House Housing Committee, says that he supports the Housing Champion Program and would vote to fund it as a standalone bill. But he said the state can still pass meaningful legislation to boost housing without financial incentives.
Alexander pointed to a pair of bills moving to Ayotte’s desk that he said will have the biggest impact: House Bill 631, which would require municipalities to allow multi-family developments in commercial zones, such as shopping areas; and House Bill 577, which would allow homeowners to build a detached accessory dwelling unit by right and expand the size limitations to do so. Both bills would allow cities to set zoning requirements, such as appearance, for those developments. 
Lawmakers are also moving along Senate Bill 188, which would allow homebuilders to use third-party inspectors to approve new homes rather than wait for state inspectors, and House Bill 428, which would prevent towns from making new changes to the state building codes, Alexander noted. SB 188 is moving to a vote on the House floor with a positive recommendation from the Housing Committee, and HB 428 passed the Senate on May 15.
“I’m not necessarily thinking that if we throw money at it, it’s going to solve the problem,” Alexander said. “I actually truly think the free market is going to be able to build affordable homes if we cut the red tape, cut the spending. We’ll build affordable homes when there’s enough supply. The market will adjust.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/housing2zone-1024x799.jpg,,,2025-05-20 06:01:20.058939

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.

– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities



In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Sweeping private school voucher program tucked inside US House tax bill

Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead

In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo by Wichayada Suwanachun/Getty Images)The issue of drug pricing has been as pressing in Ohio as anywhere. President Donald Trump last week issued an executive order requiring drugmakers to offer their products as cheaply here as they do overseas.
But players in the industry say the order lacks detail about how it would make that happen. An Ohio expert said the order ignores the arcane, often self-serving way drug prices are inflated by myriad players in the United States — including the government itself. 
In Ohio, the cost of prescription drugs has been an issue of major contention the last several years, including lawsuits against drug middlemen known as Pharmacy Benefit Managers, who’ve been accused of vertical integration, inflating prices, and deterrence of competition.
Trump last Monday issued his executive order, Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Drug Pricing to American Patients. 
The order notes that the United States has less than 5% of the world’s population, yet Americans pay “three quarters of global pharmaceutical profits.” It accuses drugmakers of unfairly billing Americans for research and development while agreeing to lower prices demanded by governments of other developed countries.
“Drug manufacturers, rather than seeking to equalize evident price discrimination, agree to other countries’ demands for low prices, and simultaneously fight against the ability for public and private payers in the United States to negotiate the best prices for patients,” the order says. “The inflated prices in the United States fuel global innovation while foreign health systems get a free ride.”
The order instructs U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. within 30 days to “communicate most-favored-nation price targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers…” Using that list, the government could import drugs selling more cheaply in other countries on a “case-by-case” basis, the order says.
However, there are about 20,000 different prescription drugs sold in the United States. The order doesn’t explain how, in just a month, anyone can gather and analyze global pricing data and decide which countries are  getting the best deal on each — much less set up and administer a “case-by-case” system on such a scale.
And there’s the much bigger question of what Trump means by “price.” That word can have many definitions in the inefficient health care system of the United States. 
There’s the list price — the price you would have to pay if you don’t have any insurance or other form of discount. But that’s not the price that is typically paid.
The drug middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, play a huge role in determining list and net prices in tens of millions of prescription drug transactions. 
The biggest three are part of giant health care conglomerates — UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna-Express Scripts — that also own top-10 insurance companies. The big PBMs represent those insurers and other payers in prescription-drug transactions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Two facts about the big PBMs are of great relevance to drug pricing: Combined, the big three handle almost 80% of the insured drug transactions. And they decide which drugs are covered by insurance, and which of those get the most favorable treatment — usually in the form of the lowest copayment.
That enables them to get drugmakers to pay them big — and growing — rebates in exchange for favorable treatment. Drugmakers have been shown to increase list prices to cover the often-nontransparent rebates.
“Because rebates are based on list prices, PBMs are incentivized to prefer drugs with higher list prices, even when cheaper generics and biosimilars are available,” Emma Freer of the American Economic Liberties Project wrote in an MSNBC column Tuesday.
For example, the Federal Trade Commission is suing the big PBMs over insulin practices it says benefitted both the PBMs and the three companies that manufacture almost all the insulin in the United States. It said the PBMs excluded cheaper drugs from coverage so it could chase bigger rebates from more-expensive alternatives. 
That would be a win-win for the drugmaker and the middleman. But it would be a big loser for the diabetic who has to make copayments based on inflated list prices, or who has to shoulder the full freight.
While Trump’s executive order accuses other countries of taking advantage of Americans, it’s silent on rebates.
The order is also silent on whether “most-favored-nation pricing” would be enjoyed by all Americans, or just those covered by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Antonio Ciaccia, the Columbus, Ohio-based president of drug-pricing consultant 3 Axis Advisors, said the government also has a strong interest in high drug prices.
That’s because the federal government also gets huge amounts in drugmaker rebates. And that’s money it can use to justify other spending, or tax cuts.
For example, drugmakers are only allowed to pay rebates in Medicare because they’re exempted from the federal anti-kickback statute. Trump in 2020 issued an executive order that would have greatly narrowed the exemption, but it went nowhere.
Then, in 2022, an extension of anti-kickback exemptions under Medicare was slipped into an unrelated gun bill. Democrats and Republicans voted for the bill. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, gave a reason — the federal government stood to collect an estimated $180 billion in Medicare rebates over a decade.
Allowing rebates might cost Americans and their government more over the long run, but as budgets are written, they’re revenue that can be used for other things. In government circles, it’s known as a “pay-for.” 
In an email, Ciaccia said that giving government an incentive to chase rebates inflates drug prices and that works against Trump’s stated priorities.
“The biggest lie in the drug supply chain is that government wants lower prices for medicines,” he said. “What government actually wants is bigger discounts off the prices of medicines.” 
He added, “When public policy is explicitly designed to inflate drug prices and then soak discounts off those prices to fund ‘other’ things, if you actually lower the prices, those ‘other things’ are in big trouble. This is why the U.S. government can’t get enough of this addictive horse-trading of drug money for other priorities, which is why high prices reign supreme.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for the Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)With minimal debate last week, the Ohio Senate advanced a measure effectively prohibiting ranked choice voting in the state. ‘Effectively’ because state lawmakers actually can’t ban the practice. Instead, Senate Bill 63 threatens to withhold an important stream of state funding for any local government that embraces ranked choice.
The proposal’s sponsors are bipartisan, and although the bill passed easily the vote split the chamber’s Democrats. Five of the Senate’s nine Democrats voted no. The bill now moves to the Ohio House where there is no companion legislation.
Lawmakers’ arguments
State Sens. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, and Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, sponsored the measure, and both made their pitch to fellow senators when it came up for a vote. Gavarone said she’s spent much of her time in office working on elections-related legislation.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Ranked choice voting flies in the face of that commonsense work by causing greater uncertainty and delayed election results that can take days or even weeks to settle,” she argued.
Gavarone said the process reduces turnout and creates confusion among voters and administrators. Apparently referencing a forthcoming article, she argued 1 in 20 voters mismark their ballot in some way.
She added that in 2024, several states with ballot measures enacting a ranked choice system rejected those proposals.
DeMora defended their bid to deprive ranked-choice municipalities of state funding.
“It doesn’t outlaw them, it doesn’t say they can’t do it. It just withholds state funds for those that do it,” he said. “May sound harsh, but it’s necessary. Ranked choice voting is expensive, confusing, and time consuming.”
DeMora noted Cuyahoga County elections officials have testified elections equipment around Ohio isn’t built to handle ranked choice elections. And he pointed to local elections in Portland, Oregon in which more than 100 candidates ran for city council and almost 20 ran for mayor.
“That’s not voter empowerment. It’s voter overload,” he argued, “The result — roughly 20% of all Portlanders, did not vote for any council candidate, and nearly 15% didn’t vote for mayor.”
Following the vote, Senate President Rob McColley argued that states that instituted ranked choice like Alaska have had buyer’s remorse. Although the vote was close, Alaska voters actually decided to keep their ranked choice system last November.
Still, McColley argued ranked choice “doesn’t do what it markets itself as doing.” He rejected the idea that through multiple rounds of counting, ranked choice arrives at a winner with majority support.
“What you’re doing instead is you’re saying this is the person that people ranked in their top however many choices,” he said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the best candidate, it doesn’t necessarily mean that a majority got it.”
Ranked choice supporters weigh in
As the bill moved through committee, ranked choice supporters far outnumbered those speaking in favor of the ban.
The group Rank the Vote Ohio helped organize that opposition and advocates for ranked choice around the state. They’ve made some inroads, but those successes have been modest.
Charter review committees in two cities, Cleveland Heights and Lakewood, have recommended putting a ranked choice charter amendment on the ballot. A handful of others are considering similar moves, and organizers are trying advance a charter amendment in Cincinnati.
Rank the Vote Ohio Executive Director Denise Riley said Gavarone and DeMora are presenting an incorrect account of ranked choice voting “to justify subverting the Ohio Constitution to suppress voters’ choices.”
“These senators have ignored the pleas from their constituents to stop spreading electoral disinformation, despite ample testimony refuting their lies,” she argued.
Riley pushed back on claims that ranked choice delays results.
“The majority of RCV jurisdictions,” she said, “release preliminary results the night of or day after the election, just as other cities do.”
Riley noted delays often have to do with allowing time for absentee ballots to arrive, not the time it takes to tabulate ballots
Riley rejected claims that procedure reduces participation, pointing to Maine’s nation-leading turnout in 2022 and a report published by the American Bar Association. She dismissed arguments about voter confusion noting several states in which exit polling showed voters understood what they were doing.
“Hopefully the Ohio House and Governor Mike DeWine won’t be tricked into subverting the Ohio Constitution based on lies,” Riley said.
For what it’s worth, the sponsors’ testimony was at times misleading. Although several states did reject ranked choice voting last year, two of those cited by Gavarone (Montana and Arizona) weren’t voting on ranked choice — they were considering different versions of open or so-called ‘jungle’ primaries.
That approach puts candidates from all parties on a single ballot with some number of top vote-getters advancing to the general election.
And DeMora’s complaints about voters not casting a ballot in a given race, known as an undervote, is at best disingenuous. He misspoke when it comes to Portland’s mayoral race — the analysis from OregonLive he relied on put the mayoral undervote at 11%, not 15%. Based on a comprehensive report from county election officials it appears that count includes undervotes and overvotes, where a voter marks two candidates at the same rank. The actual undervote was less than 7%.
Regardless, it’s not uncommon at all in local races for voters to leave a race blank. Consider the 2023 mayoral and city council races right here in Columbus. Roughly 15% of voters left the mayor’s race blank — the same amount DeMora mistakenly cited in Portland. And in Columbus’ city council races, the undervote was staggering. While Portland saw roughly 20% of voters leave council races blank, in Columbus the undervote ranged from 44%-77%.

My own experience as a business owner in Portsmouth shows me that a strong, capable, and well-funded university can lead to thriving businesses and economies as well.
In 2003, I moved from Canada to Portsmouth to establish the company headquarters for a business called Interactive Visualization Systems, or IVS3D, which focused on seafloor mapping technologies. We quickly partnered with UNH’s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (CCOM), a world-renowned research and education center for ocean mapping and hydrographic sciences, which operates as a formal cooperative partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). CCOM was established 25 years ago to expand the scope of ocean mapping interaction and collaboration with the private sector, government agencies, and other universities.
What our company quickly discovered is the operational model and structure implemented at UNH has made the rapid transfer of research and development, or R&D, from research to industry not just possible, but incredibly successful. Without collaborative R&D through a public university, it is significantly more difficult — and sometimes not economically feasible — for private companies and industry to make that leap.
Our firm’s partnership with UNH resulted in the successful transfer of significant seafloor mapping and hydrographic technologies, which allowed our company to extend products with new capabilities and modules that broadened and strengthened our international market position. These technologies have led to significant economic activity, directly supported new jobs in New Hampshire, and directly or indirectly supported various areas of the blue economy — the economic activities related to the oceans and coasts.
IVS3D was awarded the Exporter of the Year in 2006 by the Software Association of New Hampshire and the New Hampshire International Trade Association. There is no doubt that our partnership with UNH’s Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping was a significant factor in our firm’s success and in receiving this accolade.
It is clear that a strong university system allows continued industry collaboration and expertise, and helps to grow our state’s economy; it means new ideas and innovation right here in New Hampshire. Investing in our university system means investing in the many businesses and industries in our state. It’s vital to the future of our economy that New Hampshire lawmakers recognize the importance of adequately funded higher education.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/unhdurham-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 05:02:04.161425

The Ohio State Buckeyes kick off their season against the Texas Longhorns in Columbus on Aug. 30. The time of the game has not been released, but it will air on Fox and is expected to be a noon game. 
The game will be a rematch of the Cotton Bowl from earlier this year, which the Buckeyes won 28-14 — eventually going on to win the National Championship by defeating the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. 
The Ohio Attorney General would slap a $10 million fine against either the host team’s athletic conference or the television network broadcasting if a game was played starting at noon — “whichever party scheduled the earlier start time,” according to the bill. 
Ohio State has played a lot of noon games in recent years on Fox Big Noon Kickoff. The Buckeyes played five Big Noon Kickoff games during their last season. Former Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer joined the Fox Big Noon Kickoff in 2019 for two seasons and returned in 2022 after coaching the Jacksonville Jaguars for a year. 
The Ohio State-Michigan game, which is traditionally played at noon, would be an exception, according to the bill. 
Ohio Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, is also trying to use legislation to change how Buckeye fans can watch the games. Ohio Senate Bill 94 would ban state universities from entering into or renewing contracts to broadcast a game exclusively on a streaming service. 
Ohio State has exclusively streamed some of their football games in recent years on the streaming service Peacock.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)This story was originally published by ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

Just one year ago, JD Vance was a leading advocate of the Great Lakes and the efforts to restore the largest system of freshwater on the face of the planet.
As a U.S. senator from Ohio, Vance called the lakes “an invaluable asset” for his home state. He supported more funding for a program that delivers “the tools we need to fight invasive species, algal blooms, pollution, and other threats to the ecosystem” so that the Great Lakes would be protected “for generations to come.”
But times have changed.
This spring, Vance is vice president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is imposing deep cuts and new restrictions, upending the very restoration efforts that Vance once championed. With the peak summer season just around the corner, Great Lakes scientists are concerned that they have lost the ability to protect the public from toxic algal blooms, which can kill animals and sicken people.
Cutbacks have gutted the staff at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Severe spending limits have made it difficult to purchase ordinary equipment for processing samples, such as filters and containers. Remaining staff plans to launch large data-collecting buoys into the water this week, but it’s late for a field season that typically runs from April to October.
Musk, Trump threats to NOAA could harm Great Lakes

In addition to a delayed launch, problems with personnel, supplies, vessel support and real-time data sharing have created doubts about the team’s ability to operate the buoys, said Gregory Dick, director of the NOAA cooperative institute at the University of Michigan that partners with the lab. Both the lab and institute operate out of a building in Ann Arbor, Michigan, that was custom built as NOAA’s hub in the Great Lakes region, and both provide staff to the algal blooms team.
“This has massive impacts on coastal communities,” Dick said.
Multiple people who have worked with the lab also told ProPublica that there are serious gaps in this year’s monitoring of algal blooms, which are often caused by excess nutrient runoff from farms. Data generated by the lab’s boats and buoys, and publicly shared, could be limited or interrupted, they said.
That data has helped to successfully avoid a repeat of a 2014 crisis in Toledo, Ohio, when nearly half a million people were warned to not drink the water or even touch it.
If the streams of information are cut off, “stakeholders will be very unhappy,” said Bret Collier, a branch chief at the lab who oversaw the federal scientists that run the harmful algal bloom program for the Great Lakes. He was fired in the purge of federal probationary workers in February.
The lab has lost about 35% of its 52-member workforce since February, according to the president of the lab’s union, and it was not allowed to fill several open positions. The White House released preliminary budget recommendations last week that would make significant cuts to NOAA. The budget didn’t provide details, but indicated the termination of “a variety of climate-dominated research, data, and grant programs, which are not aligned with Administration policy” of ending “‘Green New Deal’ initiatives.”
An earlier document obtained by ProPublica and reported widely proposed a 74% funding cut to NOAA’s research office, home of the Great Lakes lab.
Vance’s office didn’t respond to questions from ProPublica about how federal cuts have affected Great Lakes research. The White House also didn’t respond to messages.
Municipal water leaders in Cleveland and Toledo have written public letters of support on behalf of the lab, advocating for the continuation of its work because of how important its tools and resources are for drinking water management.
In a statement to ProPublica, staffers from Toledo’s water system credited the Great Lakes lab and NOAA for alerting it to potential blooms near its intake days ahead of time. This has saved the system significant costs, they said, and helped it avoid feeding excess chemicals into the water.

“The likelihood of another 2014 ‘don’t drink the water’ advisory has been minimized to almost nothing by additional vigilance” from both the lab and local officials, they said.
Remaining staff have had to contend with not only a lack of capacity but also tight limits on spending and travel.
Several people who have worked in or with the lab said that the staff was hampered by strict credit card limits imposed on government employees as part of the effort to reduce spending by the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been spearheaded by presidential adviser Elon Musk.
“The basic scientific supplies that we use to provide the local communities with information on algal bloom toxicity — our purchasing of them is being restricted based on the limitations currently being put in by the administration,” Collier said.
NOAA and the Department of Commerce, which oversees the agency, didn’t respond to messages from ProPublica. Neither did a DOGE official. Eight U.S. senators, including the minority leader, sent a letter in March to a top NOAA leader inquiring about many of the changes, but they never received a response.
The department described its approach to some of its cuts when it eliminated nearly $4 million in funding for the NOAA cooperative institute at Princeton University and emphasized the importance of avoiding wasteful government spending. ProPublica has reported on how the loss of research grants at Princeton and the more significant defunding of the NOAA lab it works with would be a serious setback for weather and climate preparedness.
A number of the staffing losses at the Great Lakes lab came when employees accepted offers of early retirement or voluntary separation; others were fired probationary workers targeted by DOGE across the government. That includes Collier, who had 24 years of professional experience, largely as a research professor, before he was hired last year into a position that, according to the lab’s former director, had been difficult to fill.
A scientist specializing in the toxic algal blooms was also fired. She worked on the team for 14 years through the cooperative institute before accepting a federal position last year, which made her probationary, too.
A computer scientist who got real-time data onto the lab’s website — and the only person who knew how to push out the weekly sampling data on harmful algal blooms — was also fired. She was probationary because she too was hired for a federal position after working with the institute.
And because of a planned retirement, no one holds the permanent position of lab director, though there is an acting director. The lab isn’t allowed to fill any positions due to a federal hiring freeze.
At the same time, expected funds for the lab’s cooperative institute are delayed, which means, Dick said, it may soon lay off staff, including people on the algal blooms team.
In March, Cleveland’s water commissioner wrote a letter calling for continued support for the Great Lakes lab and other NOAA-funded operations in the region, saying that access to real-time forecasts for Lake Erie are “critically important in making water treatment decisions” for more than 1.3 million citizens.
In 2006, there was a major outbreak of hypoxia, an issue worsened by algal blooms where oxygen-depleted water can become corrosive, discolored and full of excess manganese, which is a neurotoxin at high levels. Cleveland Water collaborated with the lab on developing a “groundbreaking” hypoxia forecast model, said Scott Moegling, who worked for both the Cleveland utility and Ohio’s drinking water regulatory agency.
“I knew which plants were going to get hit,” Moegling said. “I knew about when, and I knew what the treatment we would need would be, and we could staff accordingly.”
The American Meteorological Society, in partnership with the National Weather Association, spotlighted this warning system in its statement in support of NOAA research, saying that it helps “keep drinking water potable in the Great Lakes region.”
Collier, the former branch chief, said that quality data may be lacking this year, not just for drinking water suppliers, but also the U.S. Coast Guard, fisheries, shipping companies, recreational businesses and shoreline communities that rely on it to navigate risk. In response to a recent survey of stakeholders, the president of a trade organization serving Great Lakes cargo vessels said that access to NOAA’s real-time data “is critically important to the commercial shipping fleet when making navigation decisions.”
Because federal law requires NOAA to monitor harmful algal blooms, the cuts may run against legal obligations, several current and former workers told ProPublica. The blooms program was “federally mandated to be active every single day, without exception,” Collier said.
The 2024 bloom in Lake Erie was the earliest on record. At its peak, it covered 550 square miles. Warming temperatures worsen the size and frequency of algal blooms. While the field season was historically only about 90 days, Collier said, last year the team was deployed for 211 days.
As the shallowest of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie is typically first to show signs of problems. But it’s also an emblem of environmental stewardship, thanks to its striking recovery from unchecked industrial pollution. The lake was once popularly declared “dead.” A highly publicized fire inflamed a river that feeds into it. Even Dr. Seuss knocked it in the 1971 version of “The Lorax.” The book described fish leaving a polluted pond “in search of some water that isn’t so smeary. I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie.”

But the rise of agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA, and labs like the one protecting the Great Lakes, along with legislation that protected water from pollution, led to noticeable changes. By 1986, two Ohio graduate students had succeeded in persuading Theodor Geisel, the author behind Dr. Seuss, to revise future editions of his classic book.
“I should no longer be saying bad things about a body of water that is now, due to great civic and scientific effort, the happy home of smiling fish,” Geisel wrote to them.
Early this year, headlines out of the Midwest suggested that “Vance could be a game-changing Great Lakes advocate” and that he might “save the Great Lakes from Trump.”
A 2023 report to Congress about the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a popular funding mechanism for projects that protect the lakes, including the research lab’s, described the lab’s work on harmful algal blooms as one of its “success stories.” Last year, with Vance as a co-sponsor, an act to extend support for the funding program passed the Senate, but stalled in the House. Another bipartisan effort to reauthorize it launched in January.
Project 2025, the plan produced by the Heritage Foundation for Trump’s second term, recommended that the president consider whether NOAA “should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.”
NOAA is “a colossal operation that has become one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” the plan said, and this industry’s mission “seems designed around the fatal conceit of planning for the unplannable.”
“That is not to say NOAA is useless,” it added, “but its current organization corrupts its useful functions. It should be broken up and downsized.”
When asked at his confirmation hearing in January if he agreed with Project 2025’s recommendation of dismantling NOAA, Howard Lutnick, head of the commerce department, said no.
One month later, the Great Lakes lab’s probationary staff got termination notices. That includes Nicole Rice, who spent a decade with NOAA. A promotion made her communications job vulnerable to the widespread firings of federal probationary workers.
In recent testimony to a Michigan Senate committee, Rice expressed deep concern about the future of the Great Lakes.
“It has taken over a century of bipartisan cooperation, investment and science to bring the Great Lakes back from the brink of ecological collapse,” Rice said. “But these reckless cuts could undo the progress in just a few short years, endangering the largest surface freshwater system in the world.”

(Getty Images)I have a dear friend who I have helped with different issues over the years. She is a disabled senior with limited eyesight, and she also has no car. I met her about 11 years ago, and while I am much younger we care about each other.
About four years ago, I recommended that she sign up for a program I had heard about — Section 8. That’s a housing assistance program funded by the federal government in which individuals in need — those who qualify — can apply and receive help in paying for a house or an apartment whose landlord takes the Section 8 voucher.
I told my friend: “You should sign up for this. It may take a while to hear from them but I think it’s a good program.”
I picked her up and drove her to the Topeka Housing Authority office, where she picked up an application.
It took a couple of years for her name to come up on the list, but she was approved. It was just in time because her rent at her apartment was about to go sky high, and she couldn’t afford to pay. Without the Section 8 voucher, who knows what she would have done.
That is why when I read about proposed budget cuts to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development totaling $32.9 billion, along with the idea of creating a grant program to send rental assistance funds to the states, my heart grieved over the precious lives this would affect.
The people who work at the Topeka Housing Authority are very special people, including the vice president of rental assistance programs, Annette Brown. They work hard to make sure those with limited incomes, the disabled and seniors find safe, affordable housing.
We are in a time when homelessness is at an all-time high. If anything, we need more funding for housing programs, including those beyond Section 8. I attended a meeting for the public in which the former executive director of the Topeka Rescue Mission discussed homelessness and how so many individuals who grew up traumatized or experienced trauma as adults often end up homeless. Barry Feaker has a true heart for the homeless and has dedicated his life to the issue.
People such as Theresa Douthart and Sehera Hays at the Topeka nonprofit organization Breakthrough House give of themselves to help assist clients to find housing. Robert Sanders, chair of the board of directors for Breakthrough House, works at the Topeka Rescue Mission and he helps the individuals there find employment and work on job skills. His work is vital and much needed.
When I think of the Section 8 program, I think of my good friend who might have had nowhere to go if she had not received her voucher. These people are good folks who need shelter. It’s time to make sure they get to stay in their dwellings and to continue to provide the funding they need to live a productive life.
The time is now to help those in need of a place to live. I worked as a volunteer writer at the international headquarters of Habitat for Humanity in 1997 for a brief time, and I saw people from all over come together to help those who I believe are God’s children.
Let’s be the light of Heaven to folks who would otherwise be homeless. Let’s offer hope. It’s needed more now than ever before.

As Jake Zuckerman reported […],"Solar panels in Damariscotta, Maine. (Photo by Evan Houk/ Maine Morning Star)It is now well-documented — such as this news story by the Pulitzer Prize winning ProPublica about actually purchasing a newspaper in Knox County to use as a source of misinformation — that the exorbitantly wealthy fossil fuel industry in Ohio is seeking to halt solar farms because they are competition.
As Jake Zuckerman reported for Cleveland.com in March: “Ohioans and their elected representatives have killed enough solar development to roughly power the state’s three largest cities in the three years since state lawmakers passed one of the nation’s most stringent restrictions on new solar development.”
But this is now poised to take a quantum leap due to a case at the Ohio Supreme Court. At issue is whether the Ohio Power Siting Board will be allowed to grant what is essentially “veto power” over solar projects to a small handful of local officials.
If granted, it will provide an almost perfect vehicle for causing the demise of solar projects across Ohio.
Here is how this policy translates into solar rejections. When decisions are given to only a few individuals, there is no longer any need to persuade a majority of the public — the way a democracy works.
Instead the “blitz” can be focused on just these few, making abuse extraordinarily easy. Solar advocates are becoming placed in an essentially impossible bind. If local officials are already “locked up” by excessive lobbying from fossil fuel interests, there now appears virtually no chance of prevailing.
It is not an exaggeration to call this a de facto “rigging” of the process.
A notorious example of this process at work is the Grange Solar Grazing Project. A count revealed a full 80% of public comments were in favor. Yet when a handful of local officials expressed opposition, this 80% majority — and the democratic process itself — got over-ridden and the project was rejected by power siting board staff.
Rural Ohioans oppose solar farms, right? Not so, developer finds

The Grange project was located in the home district of Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon — a primary co-sponsor of the openly anti-solar SB 52 legislation.
This writer is not privy to details, but it stands to reason this juxtaposition generated major pressure on local officials. The pattern repeated again on April 17: “In yet another case of the state’s hostility to utility-scale projects, state regulators have unanimously rejected a 150 MW project outside Canton because of organized opposition from local officials.”
Due to an appearance of favoritism, the solar advocacy group Third Act Ohio legitimately asked the OPSB to explain why such authority was being handed to local officials.
While completely ignoring the question, this group was referred to “criteria” in a statute to guide decisions, and directed to a link.
When examined, this statute contained no requirement that a project meet approval of local officials. Instead, the group found a separate statute specifically FORBIDDING such.
The very title is “No Local Jurisdiction.”
There is a strong appearance that this action is being “manufactured out of thin air.” If reinforced by the state Supreme Court, the stage seems set for a sweeping shutdown of utility scale solar in Ohio.
Why does this matter?
Ohio is not just one state among many. It is the fifth most prolific producer of carbon emissions. Failure in Ohio would combine with a nationwide failure promoted by Trump and the Republican Party to inflict drastic global consequences.
Science warns that crossing a climate “tipping point” will unleash a continuing spiral of increasing temperatures, with little public awareness about the immense scale of harm that would bring.
When our current 1.5 degree C increase spirals toward a 3 degree C increase, a band around the earth paralleling the equator would dry up from massive drought. 
This area — called a “dead zone” because of its unlivability — would spread north and south. Tens of millions affected by collapsed food supply would escalate into the hundreds of millions.
On a matter affecting survival of life as we know it, the OPSB must not be allowed to become the proverbial “fox guarding the chicken coop” and tilt the process toward the vested interests it was supposed to regulate!

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution, and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
 Dollars

Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”










There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges.


– Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All


Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
 Mission

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
 Governance

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

(Getty Images)Nebraska’s veterans have served our country with honor and sacrifice, and they’ve earned every available tool to help them access the benefits they were promised upon returning home.
Unfortunately, a bill currently before the Nebraska Legislature, Legislative Bill 693, risks taking away important choices from veterans and making it harder for them to get the help they need. In fact, a federal court has already ruled a similar bill an unconstitutional denial of veterans’ free speech.
The system in the state is already struggling to keep up. Nebraska has more than 106,000 veterans, but the resources dedicated to helping them are limited. Many veterans report long wait times and difficulty getting appointments, along with inconsistent follow-up from overworked and understaffed Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs). Even those who manage to connect with a VSO often find the quality of assistance varies widely, with some officers lacking the training or resources to provide effective help.
For rural veterans, these challenges tend to be exacerbated, as many areas in Nebraska remain underserved, and the nearest VSO office is hours away. Special claims clinics, organized to help with backlogged cases, show just how much demand there is. In North Platte, 272 veterans showed up in just two days, and 214 new claims were started. That’s hundreds of people who hadn’t been able to get help until a pop-up clinic came to town.
Private companies and consultants, which are often veteran-owned businesses, have stepped in to fill this gap. They bring expertise while working on a contingency basis to help veterans with complicated cases or appeals. Many veterans have found success working with these professionals when other avenues fail.
Unfortunately, as with any industry, bad actors have also emerged that use predatory practices to take advantage of our veterans. LB 693 claims to solve this problem, but the real effect would be to cut off legitimate, valuable sources of help by prohibiting veterans from hiring a consultant for assistance with claims preparation.
Taking away the option to seek compensated help removes a vital lifeline for those who need specialized support, while stifling innovation in finding better ways to serve veterans who aren’t getting what they need from the current system.
Veterans in Congress and several other states have adopted or are considering pro-veteran policies that address predatory practices while allowing veteran-owned businesses to continue providing much-needed services. These policies ensure veterans are aware of free services available to them and also protect veterans from fraud, mishandling of data and excessive fees.
The right way to protect veterans is not to ban all paid assistance. If Nebraska truly wants to support its veterans, it should trust them to decide what kind of help is right for them. Blanket bans like LB 693 only limit choices and make it harder for veterans to get help. It would turn back the clock on veterans’ rights and limit the support they deserve.

,California,2025-05-20 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s budget cuts anger allies and leave the state’s chronic deficit unresolved,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/newsom-budget-chronic-deficit-unresolved/,Major interest groups allied with the Democratic Party have been critical of Gov. Gavin Newsom's revised budget proposal since it was unveiled last week.,"When Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a revised state budget last week, he irritated — and perhaps alienated — major interest groups allied with his Democratic Party.
They flooded reporters’ email inboxes with critical reaction statements demanding that spending reductions he said were necessary to cover a substantial deficit and other aspects of the budget be blocked.
The loudest reactions came from advocates for the poor and elderly. They decried Newsom’s plan to scale back an expansion of Medi-Cal health care to undocumented immigrants that he had championed last year, as well as his imposition of $100 monthly premiums, elimination of some benefits, limits on at-home care and tighter qualifications for benefits.
“The 2025–26 budget proposal fails to marshal the resources needed to help vulnerable Californians meet basic needs like health care, housing, and food assistance,” the left-leaning California Budget and Policy Center said. “It also falls short in delivering the bold response needed from California’s leaders amid unprecedented federal threats and economic uncertainty.”
However, there were also adverse reactions from public employee unions over Newsom’s intention to hold down state worker raises and from city and county officials over a lack of grants for homelessness. Newsom’s intends to crack down on local governments he deems to be negligent.
Medical care providers dislike both Newsom’s Medi-Cal restrictions and his diversion of funds from a special tax on health care approved by voters last year meant to increase payments for treatment.
Environmentalists are angered by Newsom’s declared intention to fast-track a tunnel beneath the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to increase water deliveries to Southern California.
Advocates of Proposition 36, a voter-approved measure to crack down on some crimes that Newsom opposed, decry his failure to include funds for implementation.
The wave of criticism and opposition puts the Legislature on the spot. Those who dislike the budget are demanding that legislators compel Newsom to scale back his proposals as they negotiate a semi-final version of the spending plan over the next four weeks to meet a June 15 deadline. Many legislators owe their careers to the budget critics, particularly unions and environmentalists, and don’t want to alienate them.
Newsom, on the other hand, is approaching lame duck status, with his gubernatorial career having just 19 months remaining. Politically, Newsom can afford to irritate those groups. However, his relatively brief remaining tenure also means he is beginning to lose his sway over legislators, particularly those who will still be in office after Newsom is gone.
Newsom is obviously hoping that by making budget cuts now to narrow the state’s chronic gap between income and outgo, he can avoid joining the list of ex-governors who left the state’s finances in disarray for their successors. Newsom inherited a state budget from predecessor Jerry Brown that was in pretty good condition, but over the last six-plus years, which included a pandemic, spending growth has outpaced revenue increases.
The Legislature’s budget analyst recently cited an average 9% annual increase in outlays since Newsom became governor, but just 6% in average revenue growth.
That has left the state with what budget mavens call a substantial “structural deficit” that the analyst, Gabe Petek, and Newsom’s own budget staff estimate to be “15 billion to $20 billion annually. If it went unaddressed, it would total $42 billion through 2028-29.
Even with the reductions Newsom proposes, projected 2025-26 general fund revenues of $207 billion are still $19 billion short of the $226 billion in spending he proposes. The gap will be covered by loans and transfers from special funds, shifting spending to other pots of money and various bookkeeping gimmicks.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051425_Newsom-May-Budget_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-20 04:00:40.457360

Media were not permitted to witness death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie's execution and were instead restricted to the state prison parking lot. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie was executed by lethal injection shortly after midnight Tuesday at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, according to Department of Correction officials.
The death sentence was carried out nearly 25 years after Ritchie shot and killed Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney. The condemned man had been on death row since his conviction in 2002.
Details about the 45-year-old’s execution were sparse. No independent media representatives were permitted to witness the process. 
A statement posted on the DOC website at 1:04 a.m. Central Time indicated that “the execution process” started shortly after 12:00 a.m., and that Ritchie was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m. It’s not clear when exactly the execution drug, pentobarbital, was administered.
Ritchie’s last meal was the Tour of Italy from Olive Garden. His last words were: “I love my family, my friends, and all the support I’ve gotten. I hope they all find peace.”
DOC officials did not hold a press briefing or provide additional information.
In a late Monday order, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Ritchie’s request for an emergency stay.
Republican Gov. Mike Braun, following a unanimous recommendation from Indiana’s Parole Board, rejected the inmate’s clemency plea last week.
“Since Benjamin Ritchie’s conviction in 2002, his case has been heard and reviewed numerous times by both state and federal courts, including the Indiana Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court, never resulting in an overturned sentence,” Braun said in an early Tuesday statement. “Ritchie’s final appeal for clemency was met with an unanimous recommendation from the State Parole Board that his execution proceeded as scheduled. Today, Ritchie’s sentence has been carried out as ordered by the court.”
No independent witnesses
The Indiana Capital Chronicle made numerous requests to be placed on Ritchie’s personal witness list but was denied.
A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the Capital Chronicle and four other news outlets to pause a state law and DOC policy barring independent media witnesses.
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
The Capital Chronicle confirmed Ritchie had four witnesses present at the execution, which included two of his attorneys. The fifth witness spot was left unfilled.
The inmate was also allowed to have a pastor present in the execution chamber.
It’s not clear who — or how many — witnessed the execution on Toney’s behalf. State law permits up to eight witnesses for the victim.

Outside the state prison Monday night, two dozen peaceful protesters — including multiple clergy members — gathered to pray and called on state officials to stop the execution.
In the hours preceding Ritchie’s execution, Rev. Richard Holy, of the Catholic Diocese of Gary, led the small group through scripture readings and songs.
Intercessions called for Ritchie and other death row inmates to know “(God’s) unending love and forgiveness.” Holy prayed, too, for Ritchie’s defense team; DOC personnel tasked with conducting executions; and “for all those impacted by acts of grave harm, especially the family, friends and colleagues” of Toney.
“May they and all victims of crime know your healing power and be transformed by your mercy,” Holy said.

The bell continued to echo outside the prison shortly after midnight, as Ritchie’s execution began.

Ritchie previously exhausted all of his post-conviction appeals but sat on death row for more than two decades.
Capital punishments were put on hold for 15 years in Indiana until state officials announced last year that they’d acquired pentobarbital to resume executions.
Ritchie was Indiana’s second execution in six months.
Convicted killer Joseph Corcoran was put to death in December. Capital Chronicle reporting revealed the state paid $900,000 for execution drugs, but officials won’t say how much was purchased. Senior Reporter Casey Smith attended that execution as part of Corcoran’s five witnesses.
Final pleas rejected
The underlying crime began as a police pursuit of a stolen van on Sept. 29, 2000. Toney, the Beech Grove police officer, later pursued Ritchie on foot. Ritchie ultimately fired four shots at Toney, who was hit just above his bullet-proof vest. The officer did not survive the shooting. 
Toney died just hours before his 32nd birthday. He was survived by his wife, Dee Dee, and two young daughters.
“Officer William Toney lost his life 25 years ago serving the community he lived in. Taking a solemn oath to uphold the constitution and the laws of this great state, that its citizens may lead a peaceful life,” the Beech Grove Police Department said in a Monday afternoon statement, ahead of Ritchie’s execution.
“His life was violently taken from him by an individual whose actions adversely affected the innocent and ripped at the very fabric that holds society together,” the statement continued. “While there is no peace in the execution, there is comfort in the realization that society has kept its promise to the men and women of law enforcement to hold those accountable for their reckless choices and damaging actions, so that those still serving find strength knowing that their service is not in vain.”
Indiana set to execute man who killed officer; family ‘needs closure,’ but lawyers say it’s unjust

Republican Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita requested an execution date for Ritchie last fall. It wasn’t until April 15 that the state supreme court scheduled the lethal injection to take place before sunrise Tuesday.
“Early this morning, justice was served with the execution of Benjamin Ritchie, who was convicted of the heinous murder of Beech Grove Police Officer William Toney on September 29, 2000,” Rokita said in a statement.
“Today’s action ensures that justice was done to honor Officer Toney’s sacrifice for his community. With the Indiana Supreme Court’s decision to set his execution date and the state’s resolve to carry it out, we have reaffirmed our commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting our communities. Let this serve as a message to those who would harm our men and women in law enforcement.”
Ritchie’s attorneys argued that brain damage from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), which was only recently diagnosed, had never been fully considered in court.
Defense counsel wanted to explore the FASD diagnosis before the Indiana Supreme Court, but the justices denied requests for a new hearing. 
The inmate’s lawyers separately sought a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court and the federal court for Indiana’s northern district.
Those requests were also denied.
Ritchie expressed remorse for the killing during a clemency hearing held earlier this month at the state prison.
“I was just a kid … I didn’t care about myself, I didn’t care about anybody — nothing,” he told the parole board. “I’ve ruined my life and other people’s lives, and I’m so sorry for that night.”
Six other men remain on Indiana’s death row. Three death penalty cases are additionally pending in central Indiana, including two involving police officer deaths.

Mike Dunleavy’s veto of the latest education funding bill, House Bill 57, following his recent veto of House Bill 69, cements the decline of Alaska’s public education system as the hallmark of his administration. 
Dunleavy has been notably absent from debates and legislative negotiations on education. Even Sen. James Kaufman criticized his failure to advocate for his own education policy priorities. All we’re left with is his record to sort though — and it speaks volumes.
The Dunleavy Decline
For more than a decade, Dunleavy has worked to undermine the foundation of our schools. Brick by brick, budget by budget, he has led a systematic campaign to weaken public education in our state. 
Two key inflection points brought us here: 

2014: The Legislature passed legislation by then-Sen. Dunleavy allowing correspondence school funds to be used for private school tuition. This opened the door to a steady redirection of public money toward private benefit, and the shunting of millions of dollars from our public schools.
2018-2025: As governor, Dunleavy froze the base student allocation and has kept it virtually flat through threats and vetoes, effectively starving education budgets year after year as costs rose. This has placed schools under incredible financial strain, compounded by the diversion of public dollars away from public schools.

The results of these policy choices are staggering:
A. Spending on correspondence programs surged.
From 2014 to 2024, over $580 million in public funds were diverted from neighborhood schools through correspondence allotments. The graph below shows Alaska’s annual correspondence program spending over the past two decades, charting both our estimate of the average as well as maximum per-student allotments. A sharp increase in this spending began in 2018, the same year Gov. Dunleavy started flat-funding public education.
While many families choose correspondence programs to homeschool their children — a valuable option for some — the lack of oversight has allowed public funds to serve as de facto vouchers for private and religious schools. Though this practice is now under legal challenge, the data shown here reflects the decade it was permitted. Further, it is unclear what results we are getting for this investment, because only about 12% of correspondence students take standardized tests.
In the graph, the blue line estimates annual state spending on correspondence allotments assuming each enrolled student received the estimated average allotment. The orange line assumes the maximum allotment per student. Together, they illustrate the range of public dollars funneled into the correspondence program with little accountability for their use.

B. Student achievement has declined.
Since the 2014 policy change expanding allowable uses of correspondence allotments, fourth and eighth grade reading and math scores in Alaska’s public schools have dropped, with sharper declines after Dunleavy began flat-funding public education. 
While many factors influence academic outcomes, this pattern raises serious concerns about the long-term impact of diverting public resources away from neighborhood schools, coupled with the erosion of buying power due to years of flat-funding education.

A governor who shifts blame, not budgets
While Dunleavy proclaims himself an education advocate, his record is one of destruction. He has bled our schools dry, then blamed the consequences — teacher shortages, ballooning class sizes, gutted programs, declining scores — on the very system he eroded. 
Real accountability means more than empty rhetoric — it means fulfilling your constitutional obligation to “establish and maintain a system of public schools open to all children of the state.” It means making good on your own policy promises — like funding the Alaska Reads Act — and giving educators the tools they need to do their jobs effectively. It means compensating teachers with the wages and benefits they need to support themselves and their families. Flat funding isn’t accountability. It’s abandonment. 
A crisis of commitment
After weeks of contentious debate, the Legislature passed the first education funding bill, HB 69, with 32 of 60 legislators voting in favor. Gov. Dunleavy swiftly vetoed it. After a failed override attempt, legislators then advanced HB 57, a revised education funding bill that incorporated many of the governor’s own stated priorities. It passed with 48 votes. 
Despite its bipartisan backing and clear compromises, the governor has vetoed yet another bill and threatened an additional line-item veto in the budget, relying on the same attacks he used to justify his previous education funding vetoes both this year and last.
To override the governor’s veto of HB 57, it would take 40 legislators to stand with Alaska’s students, educators, and communities. Blocking a line-item veto in the budget will take 45. 
The tipping point
Alaska is in crisis: underfunded schools, frozen federal support, rising costs, layoffs, and an economy driving families and young professionals out. Without sensible leadership, the exodus will only accelerate.
We cannot solve this with half-measures or hollow sound bites. 
HB 57 adds just $700 in per-student funding to the education budget, still far behind the inflation increases districts face. In our view, we can’t afford not to make this investment. 
The legacy of the Dunleavy Decline
To the lawmakers weighing whether to stand with the governor or with Alaska’s families — this is your moment of truth. 
You’ve seen the data. You’ve heard from your constituents. If you continue to support the Dunleavy Decline, it will be your legacy too. 
If you believe in funding public education, you would vote for it, fight for it, build the coalition, and be on the right side of history.

Photo by Andrew VonBank/House Public Information Services.A narrowly divided Legislature adjourned Monday without completing a state budget for the next two years, ending the session just as it began: with rancorous finger pointing.
The session started with the Minnesota Supreme Court settling a dispute between Republicans and Democrats over control of the House, and now lawmakers are leaving with the biggest budget bills still outstanding, including health and human services, education and taxes.
The Legislature only passed nine budget bills out of some 20 in process, and now they will need a special session to do the rest.
Lawmakers are working to pass a $66 billion to $67 billion two-year budget that will fund everything from schools to parks to health care and services for people with disabilities. The state is grappling with a structural deficit that’s arisen from the rapidly increasing costs of special education and caring for an aging population. Given the Republican refusal to agree to any new tax revenue, lawmakers are looking to trim spending.
Most consequentially, Gov. Tim Walz and DFL leaders agreed — at Republicans’ behest — to remove undocumented adults from MinnesotaCare, the state’s subsidized health insurance for the working poor. Children will still be enrolled. The bill hasn’t passed yet, and DFL Caucus leader Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brookyln Park, told reporters Monday night that Democrats would fight it until the end.
“Until the last gavel drops on the last minute of passing a budget for the state of Minnesota, Democrats are going to keep fighting to try to get Republicans to relent on that demand,” Hortman said.
In between now and the special legislative session — date yet to be announced, though ideally before Memorial Day, they say — lawmakers will hammer out the bills in “working groups.” Because the lawmakers won’t be in session, these will be unofficial meetings that include House and Senate members of both parties. Legislative leaders have given the working groups until 5 p.m. on Wednesday to finalize their budget bills, after which Walz will likely call a special session, which leaders and Walz say should last just a single day.
Lawmakers will be back at the Capitol Tuesday morning to start the working groups.
“We have to finish this. We don’t have a choice,” House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring said. “That is what Minnesotans expect us to do. We will be able to get that work done in a bipartisan fashion.”
Despite the Wednesday deadline, Hortman said the earliest a special session could occur is Friday, though next week is probable. If lawmakers can’t reach a deal by Friday, they will have to work over Memorial Day weekend, Hortman said.
Only Walz can call legislators back into session, but only lawmakers can adjourn once they are in special session.
In the hours leading up to midnight, rank-and-file lawmakers had little work to do because legislative leaders were meeting behind closed doors and making last-minute decisions on what bills they could pass in the few remaining hours.
Multiple members walked laps on the Capitol’s second floor, while Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson played catch on the Capitol lawn. Rep. Joe McDonald, R-Delano, was spotted using an electric scooter to “have a little fun,” traveling from the bowels of the Capitol to the House members’ offices in the Centennial Office Building.
In a series of press conferences, lawmakers laid the blame on each other for failing to finish their work. House Democrats argued that Republicans were attempting to change the parameters of an agreement Walz and legislative leaders announced last week.
“Republicans keep moving the goal posts. None of the GOP demands are necessary to pass a state budget bill. All of them will make life harder and more expensive for Minnesota families,” said House DFL floor leader Jamie Long.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, said Democrats’ 23-day boycott at the outset of the session derailed lawmakers from finishing on time.
“Waiting 23 days of a stall out was not helpful,” Demuth said.
Walz on Monday afternoon told reporters he’s confident the larger budget bills will get done and said Minnesotans shouldn’t be concerned about the lack of progress.
“Against the backdrop of the dysfunction in D.C., this is a pretty remarkable thing to see — the most closely divided Legislature in Minnesota history working together in a fiscally responsible way,” Walz said.
Walz noted that June 1 acts as a perfunctory deadline: The state will be obligated to send lay off notices to state employees if there is no budget by then, and leaders want to avoid that.
The session kicked off in January with House Democrats refusing to appear at the Capitol,  seeking to to prevent Republicans from using a 1-seat, temporary advantage to take control of the House and potentially block a Democrat from being seated in a hotly contested election. The Minnesota Supreme Court was forced to intervene before the two sides agreed on a power-sharing agreement.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrWIrDDXsAANJ5v-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 01:59:03.146891

Garmatz United States Courthouse in Baltimore. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)The contentious debate over a 67-mile power transmission line proposed for Central Maryland reached a Baltimore courtroom on Monday, with three hours of arguments on eminent domain.
PSEG, the New Jersey-based power company building the line, sued more than 100 landowners along the proposed route of the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, who it said were refusing access to company representatives for environmental surveys.
The company asked U.S. District Adam Abelson to issue an order allowing it to conduct the surveys — including boundary studies, wetland delineations and forest evaluations — where property owners had refused.
It has said that it needs the surveys for its proceeding before the Maryland Public Service Commission, which will determine whether the construction of the line — planned to run through parts of Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties — can go forward.
But the property owners, represented by five different attorneys Monday, argue that the company can’t exercise eminent domain rights until it has earned its certificate from the PSC, and that entering properties for surveys constitutes a “taking” under eminent domain law.
Kurt Fischer, an attorney representing PSEG, said that “narrow” interpretation of the law would set the power line up for failure from the start.
“It simply is untenable to try to say that all these conditions have to be satisfied before you can take surveys,” Fischer said.
People power vs. electric power in feud over proposed transmission project

Fischer said the company has authority for the land surveys because it has secured a “designated entity agreement” with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, making it an entity that could conceivably earn the power of eminent domain from the Maryland PSC. Therefore, state law entitles it to complete the survey work.
But the landowners’ attorneys pointed to a provision in state law granting survey access to corporations “having the power of eminent domain.”
“‘Having the power’ means you have it right now,” said David Wyand, an attorney representing dozens of landowners.
He argued that in order to gain access to the properties to survey ahead of the PSC’s decision, the company would need to go to the Maryland General Assembly for a law change.
“They don’t want to go to the legislature for a fix,” Wyand said. “This should be a political solution — not a court solution.”
There could be more lawsuits to come. Fischer said that the 117 landowners named in the suit were “prioritized” because their properties likely host “flora and fauna” that can only be studied at particular times. But other landowners have refused access, and they could also face similar legal action, he said.
At times, Monday’s arguments also reached beyond eminent domain and into the state’s complex energy picture.
Attorneys for the landowners argued that there is wiggle room in a directive from the regional transmission grid, calling for the power line to be in service by June 2027, in part because the grid has reached agreement to keep two Maryland coal-fired power plants running through May 2029, meaning power needs will be met until then.
“The predictions about disaster are not reality,” said Harris Eisenstein, who represents the same set of landowners as Wyand.
Because the deadline can be adjusted, the power company failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm if it didn’t get the order from the judge. If the project has to be scrapped for reasons outside PSEG’s control, the company can also recoup its costs by appealing to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Eisenstein argued.
“They have an economic safety net,” Eisenstein said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But PSEG attorneys said reimbursement isn’t a guarantee. FERC can determine that costs weren’t “prudent,” and nix repayment. The agency also only reimburses 50% of any costs incurred by developers before it approves a start theto  project, said PSEG attorney Kenneth Thompson.
“There’s a guaranteed loss here,” Thompson said.
The order proposed by PSEG didn’t set many limitations on its access to properties, allowing any access up until the Public Service Commission issues its ruling, so long as the company gives 24 hours notice.
At least one respondent took issue with that proposal Monday. Attorney Jennifer Wazenski was representing the owners of River Valley Ranch, a youth camp and retreat center that hosts “the most vulnerable children” for activities including horseback riding, she said. The owners would take issue with characterizing “any entry by strangers as non-invasive,” Wazenski said.
But PSEG attorney Emily Wilson said the order is “a proposed order for a reason” and told Abelson that the company would be amenable to the court requiring a conference between attorneys to find acceptable times for surveys.
“It is not the company’s intention to have unfettered access to these properties,” Wilson said.
Wilson that the assessments mostly involve surveyors walking around the properties with tablets in hand, taking note of particular features. For the wetlands surveys, surveyors would take soil samples about 4 inches into the ground, before returning the sampled material “immediately.”
As demand for AI rises, so do power-thirsty data centers

The surveys will take “in the space of hours,” Wilson said, rather than “days and days.”
If there were damage associated with the surveys, the landowners could seek relief in court, but Thompson said PSEG would endeavor to remedy the problem so that landowners wouldn’t have to take that step.
“They want a good relationship with these folks. They don’t want to be in a World War III fight,” Thompson said.
Attorneys for the landowners have asked Abelson to dismiss the case altogether. Barring that, he ought to allow three to four months of discovery, followed by an evidentiary hearing in the fall, Eisenstein said.
“That’s what this case deserves,” Eisenstein said. “It’s an important case.”
Discovery would let the landowner’s attorneys take depositions from key personnel at PSEG, they said, to answer “unanswered questions” about the line’s route, and whether PSEG would face an “irreparable harm” if it did not get the surveys completed.
Otherwise, Abelson would be granting a preliminary injunction that would essentially decide the entire case right at the beginning, Eisenstein said.
“The toothpaste is out of the tube,” Eisenstein said. “That’s the end of the case.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_7527-1024x860.jpg,,,2025-05-20 00:59:32.580308

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The University System of Maryland Board of Regents unanimously approved a resolution Monday that would let presidents in the system assess potential cost savings such as furloughs, reductions in salary and closing of schools for certain number of days.
But the resolution, approved by the board in less than 10 minutes during a virtual session, states any actions must be reviewed with the university system chancellor and “in consultation with appropriate employee organizations.”
The board also approved an amendment that would allow the Office of the Attorney General to review any proposal that seeks to reduce employment benefits to ensure that it complies with the Fair Labor Standards Act. This amendment was offered by board member William T. “Bill” Wood, who serves as the treasurer.
The resolution comes as the university system’s 12 institutions and three regional centers face a reduction of $155 million, or 7% of their budgets, in fiscal 2026.
The reductions came as the General Assembly attempted to close a projected $3 billion deficit on its way to approving a $67 billion spending plan last month for fiscal 2026.
It’s unclear exactly how many employees could lose jobs or how many vacant positions would go unfilled, especially as President Donald Trump (R) continues to threaten cuts in federal spending that would affect states.
Several Maryland institutions such as the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, one of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, have started announcing financial measures. Some of those include eliminating positions that have been vacant for at least three years, instituting “a hiring pause with some rare exceptions” and initiating telework Fridays for some employees between May 23 to Aug. 8.

“We are enacting these measures to minimize the impact on our faculty, staff, and their families,” UMES President Heidi M. Anderson said in a statement Tuesday. “This will be a difficult period for everyone, but these efforts will make our university, our region and our state all the stronger moving forward.”
A university spokesperson wrote in an email Monday that the school has 632 full-time employees earning $50,000 and more. The school’s student enrollment for the spring was 2,841.
Morgan State University in Baltimore, the state’s biggest Black institution, with nearly 11,000 students and 2,926 employees, anticipates a $12 million decrease in appropriations.
In a statement, the university said it plans to institute a hiring freeze on nonessential roles, eliminating 35 vacant positions and “the restructuring and/or elimination of select staff positions (up to 15 in total).”
Morgan State, which isn’t affiliated with the state’s university system, highlighted the fact that no tenured or tenure-track faculty positions will be affected by its proposals.
“We are deeply mindful of the potential job loss this process may entail for some members of our dedicated staff,” according to the statement from Morgan State. “The University did not arrive at these decisions lightly. Every step taken was grounded in sound fiscal management and compassionate leadership, with the goal of protecting the long-term health and sustainability of the institution.”
Another historically Black institution, Bowie State University in Prince George’s County, with more than 6,000 students, does not plan any staff reductions or furloughs. However, a spokesperson with Bowie State also said Monday that the school does not plan to fill 50 vacant positions.
A spokesperson with Salisbury University said the university also doesn’t anticipate layoffs or furloughs at the university with 7,025 students and slightly more than 1,100 full-time employees.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Our goal is to protect and prioritize our students and our employees as much as possible,” spokesperson Jason Rhodes said in an email Monday. “SU will continue to follow that principle as long as challenging budget times continue.”
Stuart Katzenberg, with the American Federation of State, County and Muncipal Employees Maryland Council 3, said Monday his organization has not discussed or received any proposals on salary reductions or furloughs from any representatives of the university system.
“If they were to pursue those with AFSCME, they’d have to come and negotiate with us as well as apparently get approval by the chancellor. They have not done that with us yet,” said Katzenberg, director of growth and collective bargaining for the union.
AFSCME represents more than 6,000 employees in the university system, including custodians, mechanics, administrative assistants and those in information technology. The university system and AFSCME signed a contract in August that increased the minimum salary of $38,000 and boosted annual leave and other benefits.
“Our members make the campuses run. Without them, the campuses wouldn’t be clean. There wouldn’t be air conditioning in the summer,” Katzenberg said. “So without our members, the campuses couldn’t run.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bowie-State-University-11-22-2023-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-20 00:59:32.580308

(Photo by Staff Sgt. Jared Duhon/U.S. Air Force)A Maryland board tasked with bringing down prescription drug costs is working through a “dossier” of a  medication to treat type 2 diabetes — the first of many such reports to determine if there are ways for the state to save money on certain medications.
The Prescription Drug Affordability Board unveiled a 92-page draft report Monday for Farxiga, a brand-name medication for dapagliflozin, to help board members determine if the drug is “unaffordable” for Marylanders.
It is the first of several dossiers analyzing the cost burdens of six popular prescription drugs in an effort to find avenues for the state to save on medications for those on the state’s health plan.
PDAB staff have been working on the Farxiga dossier since November, according to Andrew York, executive director for the board. He hopes that future dossiers will be easier to pull together now that staff have a format to work with.


Targeted drugs
Six drugs were selected for “cost review,” and address several conditions including Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, eczema, Crohn’s disease and more.

Jardiance

“I think staff now knows the time it takes to put these dossiers together,” York told the board during the virtual Monday meeting. “That organizational process and cross referencing to make sure that everything is available to the board — that took a lot of time and effort. But now that that template’s in place, I think we’ll be moving forward pretty quickly.”
Since the board’s inception in 2019, it has been involved in a lengthy rule-making process to determine what drugs could be expensive for state employees and to establish methods to bring those costs down.
In March 2024, PDAB board members officially selected six drugs to undergo the “cost review” process, part of which includes an information gathering period to develop a dossier on the drugs. But the board has yet to bring down costs for any drugs on the state health plan.
Meanwhile, Gov. Wes Moore (D) is expected to sign off on legislation Tuesday to expand the authority of the board to bring down costs for more Marylanders, not just those on the state plan.
Critics in the legislature and the pharmaceutical industry cited the pace of the board’s progress to argue unsuccessfully against expanding PDAB’s authority, but House and Senate bills to do just that passed by comfortable margins this year.
House Bill 424 and Senate Bill 357 would allow the board to establish what are called upper payment limits on the commercial market, to place a limit on how much the state is willing to pay for certain drugs. The board currently has that authority for state employees and others on the state health plan.
The expanded authority would only go into effect a year after the board has successfully placed upper payment limits for two drugs on state health plans – meaning it will still be some time before the state can wield its new authority on the commercial market.
But the dossier Monday sheds some light on different considerations that the board will use to determine if it will take action to reduce state spending on Farxiga — including overall state spending on the drug, prevalence of the diseases that the prescription drug treats, and costs of the disease to the health care system.
In Maryland, about 10.5% of adults aged 18 years or older had been diagnosed with diabetes as of 2022 data, the report says.

“In Maryland, for calendar year 2021, total and per-patient medical costs attributable to diabetes were $6.506 billion and $11,909, respectively,” the report says, citing data from the American Diabetes Association.
The dossier reports similar data for other conditions Farxiga is often prescribed to treat, such as heart failure and Chronic Kidney Disease.
From 2022 through 2023, Maryland spent $1.4 million on the most common dosage of Farxiga (10 MG) for those on the state health plan – about 289 Marylanders, according to the dossier.
The dossier reports that out-of-pocket costs for Farxiga can vary, depending on insurance coverage.
The median cost for 10 milligrams of Farxiga cost $160 for those with commercial insurance in 2023, but those on the state health plan paid $60 for the same dose. Meanwhile, those on Medicare paid a median of $158.90, according to 2022 data.
But portions of the report are redacted from the public due to confidentiality restrictions, and the dossier is not finalized yet. Following Monday’s meeting, PDAB staff will make tweaks on the dossier to more clearly relay the information. The Farxiga dossier will then go up for a 15-day public comment period.
Staff is working on a dossier for another drug that helps treat type 2 diabetes called Jardiance, which should also be available for public comment soon, according to York.
The board still has to officially determine if Farxiga or Jardiance pose an “affordability challenge” before board members can consider next steps to bring down costs, which could include setting upper payment limits.

Protect Connecticut is a coalition dedicated to passing critical legislation this session that will proactively safeguard our residents from the relentless harm of a hostile federal administration.
As a coalition, Protect Connecticut represents the majority of people in Connecticut, including immigrants, families struggling financially, LGBTQ+ communities, survivors of violence, and individuals seeking healthcare —particularly those directly threatened by federal policies. Together, we are urgently calling for meaningful and decisive action in three key areas:
First, protecting immigrants by securing personal information and ensuring Connecticut government does not cooperate with or aid ICE in their war on immigrant communities. 
Second, ensuring robust access to healthcare, including reproductive and LGBTQ+ care. 
Third, investing deeply in our social safety net policies and services that promote opportunity and economic security for all by guarding against challenges like housing insecurity and food insecurity.
It’s important to note that the three policy priority areas within our collective agenda are not the only issues of import. Many of us seek to advance other areas and policies that are not enumerated here and will continue to do so. However, this agenda focuses on that which is under assault by the federal administration and will have the biggest impact on Connecticut residents and the state’s finances.
If we fail to act, the consequences could be irreparable. The harm to families, healthcare access, and civil rights could become permanent. Connecticut is uniquely positioned to lead —not just because we have the resources, but because our state has consistently demonstrated a deep commitment to justice, equity, and community. Despite that deep commitment, we still have many residents in every zip code across the state who are barely getting by and that number will continue to grow due to the impact of dismantling federal agencies and programs.
Protect Connecticut is more than an agenda. It is a roadmap for resilience and safety, a concrete plan to protect the lives and dignity of people in our state. But we cannot succeed alone. We invite you to join our push to pass these essential protections now. Connect with us and help protect Connecticut: instagram.com/protectctnow
The Protect CT Coalition is made up of the following organizations: ACLU of Connecticut, CT Coalition Against Domestic Violence, CT Students for a Dream, CT Voices for Children, End Sexual Violence CT, Equality CT, Partnership for Strong Communities, Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, Reproductive Equity Now, She Leads Justice and United Way of Connecticut.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5112-1024x603.jpeg,,,2025-05-20 00:59:32.580308

To me, it feels like an attack on everything I’ve fought to become.   .","I was 13 years old when I caused the accidental death of a friend. 
That’s the kind of sentence that stops people in their tracks and it should. I remember the silence that followed, not just from the world around me, but inside me. How do you move forward from something like that when you’re still just a kid yourself? I didn’t know how. No one did. I just kept waking up inside a body that felt like a prison and a world that no longer had a place for me.
There was no guidebook for a child who had taken a life, even by accident. No healing circle. No support group. Just isolation, shame, and eventually, prison. I wore my guilt like skin. And no matter where I went, school, the streets, a cell, I never felt like I belonged. Not to a community. Not to the future. Not even to myself.
That’s why AmeriCorps Public Allies didn’t just change my life. It saved it.
I didn’t come into the program confident or put together. I came in broken. But Public Allies didn’t ask me to hide that. They didn’t shame me. They didn’t treat me like a case file. They treated me like a human being with potential, not just a past.
They gave me meaningful work and trusted me to lead. They handed me a mic when I thought I’d never have a voice. They sat with my story when others ran from it. Through service, I found healing. Through community, I found purpose. And for the first time in years, I felt something crack open: I didn’t want to die. I wanted to live.
Not survive. Live.
AmeriCorps didn’t save a version of me. It saved me. All of me.
Now, the government wants to shut it down. To some, that’s just a budget cut. To me, it feels like an attack on everything I’ve fought to become — on everyone like me who is out there right now, quietly losing hope. Waiting for someone to see them.
Because here’s the truth: not everyone has the same starting line. Some of us start with a tragedy that follows us like a shadow. Some of us grow up in systems that forget us until we fail. Some of us have never once been told, “You still matter.”
That’s what Public Allies did. It said, You still matter.
If you’ve never hated yourself so much that breathing felt like punishment, you may not understand what programs like this really do. They don’t just build résumés. They build lives. They don’t just reduce unemployment. They reduce despair.
Don’t let AmeriCorps die.
Because if you do, you’re not just cutting a line item. You’re cutting off lifelines. You’re killing the one place where someone like me can walk in with nothing but a story and walk out with a reason to keep going. I am one of the lucky ones. And I’m writing this because I know there’s someone else out there, on the edge, waiting to be seen.
Don’t let us disappear.

(Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)People convicted of first-degree car theft in Colorado will be unable to have a firearm under a new law signed by Gov. Jared Polis on Monday.
House Bill 25-1171 adds the offense to the list of crimes covered by the Possession of Weapon by Previous Offender statute in the state. POWPO makes it illegal to own a firearm for people with one or more of the listed convictions on their record.
“From now on anyone convicted of first degree motor vehicle theft (is) ineligible to possess a firearm, keeping guns out of the wrong hands and protecting our communities,” Polis said in a statement. “I am proud of our work to improve public safety in Colorado, and with this bill signed into law, I look forward to continuing our bold progress to protect Coloradans and our communities.”
A person can be convicted of first-degree vehicle theft only after two other vehicle theft convictions.
The bill was sponsored by Reps. Shannon Bird of Westminster and Andrew Boesenecker of Fort Collins and Sens. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo and Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City, all Democrats. It passed the Legislature with bipartisan support.
A 2021 law narrowed the scope of the POWPO application in Colorado, and while a 2022 law then added more felonies back to the list, it left car theft out.
“What we heard in committee from law enforcement is a plea. They are begging us, in these situations where you have someone who has been convicted three times of auto theft, they are asking us to please take the firearm out of the equation,” Boesenecker said on the House floor during bill debate.












What we heard in committee from law enforcement is a plea. They are begging us, in these situations where you have someone who has been convicted three times of auto theft, they are asking us to please take the firearm out of the equation.


– State Rep. Andrew Boesenecker




As the bill made its way through the Legislature, Hinrichsen said that car theft is distinct from other property crimes and non-violent offenses left out of POWPO.
“When we look at punishments relative to crime, either in terms of sentences or in terms of restrictions, what we should be looking at is the severity of the action and the risk and harm done to the victim and community more broadly. When you’re dealing with the theft of a vehicle, you’re disrupting the entire life of an individual,” he said during the bill’s first Senate committee hearing.
The bill was amended in the House, under a change brought by Republican representatives, to allow a person to petition a court to restore their firearm possession rights after 10 years.
“This is the crucially important piece — for someone who has turned their life around, they can petition to get this removed,” Rep. Ryan Armagost, a Berthoud Republican who helped negotiate the amendment, said on the House floor.
But that amendment ended up being a sticking point. Other crimes on the POWPO list do not have that restoration pathway for adults, creating equal protection concerns. Sponsors said, however, that the attorney general’s office said the bill with the amendment is defensible if a legal challenge emerges.
But the Senate stripped the amendment from the bill and passed a version without the restoration piece. The House then refused to accept the change and forced the Senate to decide, in the last hours of the session on May 7, to either pass the House version of the bill or allow the legislation to die. The Senate passed the bill.
“I appreciate the hard work of the House sponsors to work on deals that bring parties into agreement, that brought representatives to be able to get behind this policy that I believe will save lives in Colorado,” Hinrichsen said.

House Bill 7065 would reduce the penalty for illegally possessing less than half an ounce of psilocybin from a crime that carries a possible prison term to a $150 fine for a first offense.
Republicans attacked the legislation as premature, given ongoing research into its potential medical benefits, and flawed in that it does not precisely define psilocybin, which is a chemical compound.
“Why jump the gun on this?” asked Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien.
The bill passed despite significant dissent among Democrats: 22 joined 43 Republicans in opposition. Two Republicans joined 72 Democrats in favor. A dozen lawmakers did not vote.
The Democratic majority rejected several Republican amendments, including one that would have created a working group to study cities and states that have decriminalized psilocybin.
“Psilocybin is a product which has been shown to be an effective therapeutic for various mental illnesses, including treating PTSD, addictions, depressions and anxiety disorders,” said Rep. Steven Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee. 
Stafstrom called the bill a cautious step that would cease to equate the drug with heroin and cocaine.
“What this bill seeks to do is pretty simple. It doesn’t legalize the substance. I want to be really clear. This bill does not legalize psilocybin,” he said. “What this bill says is, instead of being subject to a year in jail for possessing under half an ounce of psilocybin, you’d be subject to a fine.”
Marra said she is aware of anecdotal evidence of the drug’s promise but said the state should defer to the FDA on decriminalization and await the results of ongoing research.
“I believe there is promise for this drug,” she said.
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, the ranking Republican on Judiciary, mocked the majority for even debating the bill.
“Believe it or not, while people’s electric bills are going through the roof, taxes are being increased — we hear across the state about our municipalities raising taxes — the Connecticut legislature is decriminalizing magic mushrooms,” Fishbein said. “Yup, that’s what we have before us.”
Fishbein complained the bill had no standards for assessing potency.
“That’s how we’re going to operate here? I think we need a lot more information,” he said. “I’m very concerned about the lack of studies.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7499-1024x804.jpg,,,2025-05-19 23:01:23.731611

(Photo by Dominique Sindayiganza courtesy of SEIU 1199NE)As striking workers picketed outside Butler Hospital for the fifth day Monday, the Providence psychiatric hospital’s management announced that health insurance for employees not actively working will be terminated at the end of the month.
About 800 members of New England Health Care Employees Union (SEIU 1199NE) were sent a letter informing them that medical, dental and vision benefits would expire on May 31. After that date, workers and their dependents will be ineligible for hospital-provided benefits unless they elect to continue their coverage through COBRA, the federal law allowing individuals to pay the full premium for their health coverage, including any portion previously paid by their employer.
“I know this is a scare tactic and all of that, but it’s horrible,” Brooke Huminski, a social worker in Butler’s Inpatient Assessment Center, said during an interview while picketing outside the hospital entrance along Blackstone Boulevard Monday at around 6:15 p.m. “It’s horrible to do this to someone.”
Strike appears imminent at Butler Hospital

Huminski said she knew it was always a possibility that hospital management could cut off health benefits. But the news comes at a stressful time as she and her partner are in the middle of an IVF treatment. Huminski said she also takes medication to manage a serious health condition.
“I’ve worked eight years evenings in the psychiatric emergency room,” Huminski said. “I love my patients. I have loved my job. I love my colleagues, but I’m just heartbroken by this and terrified.”
SEIU 1199NE represents clerical staff, registered nurses, mental health workers, and housekeeping and dietary staff at the 168-bed hospital owned by Care New England. All four of the union’s contracts with Care New England expired on March 31. The union announced April 25 that its members had voted to authorize a strike as they continued to demand higher wages, pension program access for future employees and greater attention to workplace safety. The last time both sides met was on May 7, and SEIU went on strike at 6 a.m. May 15.
According to the letter sent to SEIU 1199NE members, their last hospital paycheck will be May 23. Workers’ life insurance, long-term disability, health care flexible spending and dependent care spending accounts and insurance for critical illness, accident and voluntary legal coverage ended on May 14.
“We have worked diligently to reach a fair and sustainable agreement, offering significant wage increases and improvements in workplace safety,” Butler President and Chief Operating Officer Mary E. Marran said in a statement posted on its website. “Unfortunately, SEIU 1199 NE ended negotiations on May 7 and has not yet returned to the bargaining table, despite our continued willingness to resume talks.”
SEIU 1199NE maintains that it submitted a proposal at 8 p.m. on May 7 but that hospital management never responded.
“We continue to urge SEIU 1199 NE to re-engage in good-faith negotiations so we can reach a resolution that refocuses our shared commitment on what matters most—our patients and the dedicated professionals who care for them,” Marran added.
Rhode Island Current reached out to Care New England for additional comment, but a spokesperson said that Marran’s message posted online would be the only comment.
Rep. Rebecca Kislak, a Providence Democrat, has joined striking workers every day except Sunday. “What is breaking my heart right now is that I’m seeing an employer that doesn’t pay a whole lot to their employees to erode any goodwill and that worries me about the future of the hospital,” Kislak said.
Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat, visited with striking workers to show support for the first four days but was not there on Monday. He said Monday night that he was surprised when he learned about termination of health benefits.
“I thought that the hospital would be proceeding in better faith when it came to reaching an agreement with these frontline health care workers and I’m disappointed that they’ve exercised this measure to shut them out of their benefits,” Morales said.
“It’s a power move that sends a message that the bosses are in charge and that the workers should feel vulnerable.”
Morales said union leaders shared with him that workers planned to start applying for unemployment insurance Monday night.

The medical workforce debate started during a workforce panel discussion at the College of Eastern Idaho after Rep. James Petzke, R-Meridian, asked the panelists if the Idaho Legislature was doing enough to develop the kind of modern workforce Idaho employers and industries need.
Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center CEO Betsy Hunsicker didn’t sugar-coat her answer. She immediately told Petzke the short answer is “no.”
“It’s very challenging, and we don’t have OB-GYN coming in here,” Hunsicker said. “We’re not training general surgeons. We’re not. Physicians generally practice where they train. So I think the training piece for residency for physicians is really probably something that needs to continue to grow.”
 Physicians are ‘scared to practice’ in Idaho due to strict abortion ban, doctor tells committee 

Hunsicker and other panelists asked legislators to support two programs to help develop the state’s workforce – medical residency programs and the Idaho Launch workforce training initiative championed by Gov. Brad Little.
The discussion and the tension ratcheted up during a presentation later Monday given by Dr. Jennifer Cook, the OB fellowship director and associate director of the family medicine residency program at Full Circle Health in Boise. 
Cook was giving an overview of health education programs and talking about ways to bring more doctors to Idaho. 
Cook said huge swaths of Idaho are considered maternal care deserts, and the state ranks near the bottom nationally when it comes to physicians-per-capita.
In addition to supporting incentives like loan repayment programs and investing in medical residencies and fellowships, Cook told legislators they could attract more doctors if they clarified the state’s near total abortion ban to include the health of the pregnant mother – not just the life of the pregnant mother.
“Because right now, physicians are kind of scared to practice here, I’m not going to lie,” Cook told JFAC members. “Because there’s so much ambiguity – and I don’t think that was intentional in any way, shape or form. I think people are trying to support their constituents – but it has led us to this gray area where we don’t know what management is actually allowable, and that’s really hard.”
Cook said that ambiguity has real consequences.
“I had fellows who sat and watched a woman who was 19 weeks pregnant bleed and couldn’t do anything about it, and just waited until she was so sick she was about to die,” Cook said. “If that was your family, it would be really scary.”
While she was talking, Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, turned to his neighbor, Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, and said, “that’s not true.”
Moments later, Cook briefly paused her presentation to JFAC members.
“I can see some eyes rolling,” Cook said. “I can see you all rolling your eyes.”
Cook then continued her presentation. 
When she fielded questions after her presentation, Rep. Steven Miller, R-Fairfield, and Tanner told Cook that they feel Idaho’s abortion law is clear.
Tanner told Cook he thinks the discussion is political. He said his conservative doctor friends tell him the law is clear, while people who lean left are “going nuts” over the abortion law.

In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun after Cook’s presentation, Tanner said the life of the unborn baby gets lost in the debate.
“The problem that I see that they run into is they’re only looking at the aspect of the mom, keeping that person alive, and not the actual baby,” Tanner told the Sun.
Tanner also referenced the University of Washington’s Washington, Wyoming Alaska, Montana and Idaho, or WWAMI, medical program.
“Part of the problem, in my opinion, I think overall is where you look at the training aspect that they actually go through,” Tanner told the Sum. “So when they’re going through the WWAMI they’re going through up in Washington, and some of the actual classes and how most of the doctors that I talked to have come out like they’re fully like, ‘Abortion is no different than needing stitches. It’s no different than anything.’ And I think they dehumanized that child at that point in time.”
However, the University of Washington has said it does not use Idaho funds to teach courses related to abortion care, according to the Spokesman-Review. 
At a legislative hearing during the 2025 session, UW School of Medicine Vice Dean Suzanne Allen said the school would agree to Idaho’s abortion laws and stipulations, according to the Spokesman-Review.
“The University of Washington does not spend any Idaho funds on abortion care or abortion training,” she said.
In a statement regarding House Bill 176, which sought to defund Idaho WWAMI, UW said it was disheartened to see the Legislature discuss dissolving a more than 50-year partnership.
“The Idaho WWAMI partnership is required to teach the same content to our students that other medical schools are required to teach across the country to pass the national licensing exam,” the university stated. “This includes women’s health content such as normal labor and delivery as well as complications including miscarriages that require abortion procedures.”
  Legislature’s budget committee has been told before that abortion ban makes it harder to attract, retain maternal health care workers 

Although the Idaho Legislature adjourned April 4 and is not in session, JFAC often conducts interim meetings during the fall and spring to continue monitoring the state budget and take a closer look at agencies and programs that receive state funding.
This is not the first time JFAC members have been told that the Idaho Legislature’s abortion ban has made it harder to attract and retain physicians.  
During a different JFAC interim tour on Nov. 21, 2024, Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine President Tracy Farnsworth told legislators the abortion ban has run off existing physicians and may be scaring away new ones. 
“Many of you probably know this, with our current Idaho state abortion laws that provide very little, if any, opportunity to terminate a pregnancy for health because we don’t have a health of the mother exception, we’ve lost roughly 25% of our OB-GYN,” Farnsworth said in November.
“We’ve gone from 200 to 150 OB-GYN, and we are hearing anecdotal evidence of a number of graduating OB-GYN residency students choosing not to come to Idaho because of fear of losing their license and (being) criminalized,” Farnsworth added.
JFAC members did not vote on any budgets or any bills on Monday. 
JFAC’s spring meetings continue Tuesday with a tour of community resource centers and the Idaho Department of Water Resources’ Eastern Regional Office. 
JFAC’s meetings are scheduled to conclude Wednesday with a tour of Idaho National Laboratory facilities.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska’s version of “One Big Beautiful Bill” for property tax relief went up in smoke Monday despite an effort to narrow new revenues to increased taxes on cigarettes and vapes.
It becomes the third property tax package in the past year to propose and fail to garner traction to use new sales tax revenues to lower property taxes. It also deals a significant blow to Gov. Jim Pillen’s pledge to keep property taxes flat this year as he eyes reelection.
Legislative Bill 170, led by State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, failed 30-15. It needed 33 votes to overcome a filibuster from opponents across the political spectrum who opposed the tax “shift.” The proposal originally sought to add sales taxes to 20 currently exempt goods or services, including pop, dating services, chartered jets, swimming pool cleaning and maintenance services and pet grooming. It also sought to hike the taxes on cigarettes (up to $1.36) and vapes (up to 40%).
The original package anticipated $110 million in new revenue, with $100 million directed to property tax credits to offset property taxes paid to local K-12 school districts.
“Property taxes remain one of the most painful burdens our residents face, impacting everyone from family farmers to first-time homeowners,” Brandt said. “This legislation is a responsible, targeted effort to address the burden by broadening Nebraska’s tax base.”

However, as happened at the end of both the 2024 regular session and an 18-day special session Pillen called last summer, lawmakers ultimately rejected expanded sales taxes on several goods and services, which could have raised about $53 million, Brandt’s estimates indicated.
“It’s just rebranded or repackaged from the prior two failed attempts that this Legislature has not moved forward for a variety of different reasons, with strong support across a politically diverse coalition,” said State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln.
‘Representing some ideology’
Brandt sought to narrow LB 170 to a lower revenue target of $80 million for new property tax relief each year by striking any broadening of the sales tax base. Instead, he proposed to increase cigarette taxes to $1.64 per 20-pack, which he said would raise nearly $60 million each year, and to increase vape taxes to 40% wholesale, which he said would raise about $15 million.
Both versions of LB 170 also included a proposal from Fremont State Sen. Dave Wordekemper to capture a 20% tax on cigars, cheroots and stogies purchased online, which senators estimated would raise $100,000 in revenue.
That left roughly $5 million that would have needed to be made up later, such as by adding back a handful of expanded sales taxes to the package.

State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who has fought for increased taxes on vapes, said property tax relief is necessary for the grandmas or grandpas across Nebraska, as well as retirees and veterans, who are being priced out of their homes because of property taxes.
Hughes, State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte and a handful of other conservatives in the officially nonpartisan Legislature defended the shift to new sales tax revenue as targeting “optional” goods or services. 
“We are so dang lazy we can’t even go to the McDonald’s drive-through by ourselves to go pick up our food. We hire someone to pick it up, and that’s a service, and we’re not even talking about taxing that service,” Hughes said.
A vote against LB 170, supporters said, was a vote against property tax relief.
“Don’t tell me you’re representing your constituents when you say you don’t want to lower property taxes, because you aren’t representing your constituents,” said State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte. “You’re representing some ideology.”
‘Tax increase with no end in sight’
Much of the pushback to LB 170 was bipartisan, including from Republican State Sens. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, and Stan Clouse of Kearney, who said the bill was not “sustainable” relief. 
Clouse, a former longtime Kearney mayor, said the relief was “not real” and was “simply increasing revenue streams.” He suggested eliminating unfunded mandates was a better focus.

Added von Gillern: “This is putting dollars into the top of a bucket that has a hole in the bottom of it.”
State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln, a Pillen appointee, criticized LB 170 and its narrower components as a “tax increase with no end in sight” that wasn’t the right path forward, even as he identified property tax relief as a top priority for his district.
Von Gillern and State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman said the increased revenue also wouldn’t keep up with property tax growth, which was nearly $300 million in two of the past three years. The exception in annual increases that high was last fall, after the state took on the tab for property taxes previously levied by community colleges.
The state budget passed last week included about $57 million in expanded property tax credits for next year, and about $11 million more for homestead exemptions. Even combined with the $80 million in Brandt’s bill, property taxes would likely increase statewide next year.
That stands in direct contrast to Pillen’s pledge to hold property taxes flat. He has said that, without “a shadow of a doubt,” he and allies would find additional property tax relief this year.
‘The right triggers’
Storer, a rancher in north-central Nebraska, said she was concerned that the continued reliance on property tax credits was “feeding the demon” and taking away accountability from local taxing authorities.
“We still haven’t pulled the right triggers,” Storer, a freshman lawmaker, said.

Another path forward for property tax relief includes buying down property tax levies directly, an approach led by Hughes in a Pillen-backed LB 303, which also sought long-term changes to how the state funds K-12 schools. 
However, the provision to lower property taxes directly has since been stripped out of LB 303 to give time for senators to further study the approach before returning next January.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, who has consistently opposed expanding the sales tax to exempted items without lowering the 5.5-cent statewide sales tax rate, said the latest package would pick “winners and losers.” 
Dungan criticized repeated efforts for a “grand slam swing” at tax policy when expansive adjustments need more time to be effective.
On the Democratic side, State Sens. Ashlei Spivey and Terrell McKinney, both of Omaha, noted LB 170 wouldn’t have helped renters.
Conrad and State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha cautioned that an increased tax on nicotine products also wouldn’t be paid by “Big Tobacco” executives, but everyday Nebraskans.
Dungan and State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha added that increasing taxes on cigarettes and vapes would hopefully decrease tobacco usage, which could lead to less tax revenue.
“If we continue to just try to put a piece of tape over the hole in the boat,” Dungan said, “it’s not going to fix the actual problem.”
After the vote, Brandt said he was disappointed and that he had made his “run” for more relief.
“If the Legislature doesn’t want to give property tax relief, I don’t know what else I can do,” Brandt told the Nebraska Examiner.



Dozen senators crossed party lines on final vote
Voting to move forward on LB 170: Democratic State Sens. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, Jason Prokop of Lincoln, Dan Quick of Grand Island, Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Victor Rountree of Bellevue.
Voting against LB 170: Republican State Sens. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County, Beau Ballard of Lincoln, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Glen Meyer of Pender, Tanya Storer of Whitman, Jared Storm of David City and Paul Strommen of Sidney.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-20 01:29:56+00:00,CT Mirror,Bethany first selectwoman to resign after scathing report,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/bethany-first-selectwoman-paula-cofrancesco-to-resign/,Paula Cofrancesco was accused of mishandling reports that children were sexually abused while attending town-run camp programs.,"This story has been updated. 
Bethany First Selectwoman Paula Cofrancesco announced her resignation before a town meeting on Monday night, reading from a letter that she said she planned to file with the town clerk’s office on Tuesday morning. 
The resignation comes after a scathing report was released on May 15 that accused Cofrancesco of mishandling a number of allegations that children were sexually abused while attending after-school and camp programs run by the town. The release of that report was met with numerous calls for her resignation by elected officials and residents in light of what was described as her “ineptitude, malfeasance, and gross neglect.”
Cofrancesco’s announcement before a packed town meeting was greeted with cheers.
Yet, even as she resigned, Cofrancesco seemed to double down on her repeated claims that she’d done nothing wrong. 
“I have always acted in the best interest of the town of Bethany, and while I disagree with the findings of the recent report as to my conduct, I recognize that my continuing as first selectwoman will be a distraction to the important business that needs to be done.”
Cofrancesco added that she hoped the town could begin the process of healing before closing her comments and walking away from the podium.
The report that was released last week was prepared by the Pullman & Comley law firm, followed a seven-month investigation and asserted that Cofrancesco deceived Bethany residents by repeatedly claiming she did not know the nature of the allegations against the accused, Anthony Mastrangelo. According to the report, Cofrancesco ensured that Mastrangelo continued to be employed by the town even after the school superintendent had fired him and banned him from the school campus. Cofrancesco even resisted efforts to make programs safer: according to an interview in the report with Cofrancesco’s assistant, no background checks were conducted until 2024.
The resignation takes place as lawmakers are debating a controversial bill that would require municipal camps to be licensed by the state. Currently, camps in Connecticut that are run by towns and cities receive no state oversight and aren’t required to comply with even basic regulations that private camps must abide by, like conducting staff background checks and testing water quality. 
Cofrancesco was among the voices of opposition when a similar bill was proposed in 2023. At the time, she argued that municipal camps already received enough oversight, including from elected leaders like herself.
Cofrancesco first ran for the position of first selectwoman in 2019. Among her supporters at the time was Amy Lestinsky, the mother of a girl who became the fifth child to make abuse accusations against Mastrangelo. Though Mastrangelo no longer worked for the town by the time that abuse is alleged to have occurred, he was a frequent babysitter for local kids and Cofrancesco kept quiet the allegations, including investigations by the Department of Children and Families and Connecticut State Police.
“I am extremely happy that our [first selectwoman] will be handing in her resignation,” Lestinsky told the CT Mirror. “While I feel she should have resigned last year, this is finally a step forward for our community to begin to heal.”
In addition to Cofrancesco, the report places blame on Connecticut State Police, calling their delay in seeking arrest warrants for Mastrangelo an “unexplained failure.” While Cofrancesco has now announced her resignation, police still have not provided an explanation for their lack of action, during which time a fifth victim was allegedly sexually assaulted. 
Cofrancesco’s resignation will go into effect on June 6, according to her statement. Gina Teixiera, a member of the Bethany Board of Selectman, told the Connecticut Mirror that she believed Cofrancesco’s resignation should be effective immediately. 
“It’s disappointing but not surprising to hear her say she acted in the best interest of the town when Pullman & Comley’s report, supported by evidence, says otherwise. Is lying to town residents and members of the Board of Selectman in the town’s best interest? Is putting town children in danger in the town’s best interest? Is creating massive liability for the town in the town’s best interest?” 
Teixiera said she’d like to know what exactly in the report Cofrancesco disagrees with.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)As a House commission studying Rhode Island landlord-tenant law met to prepare its final report Monday, tenants’ rights organizations made a last-minute push for lawmakers to pass legislation to restrict the reasons landlords can use to justify evictions or refuse to renew a lease.
A proposal to codify “just cause evictions” surfaced as the 11-member commission formed last summer held its final meeting, drawing opposition from Realtors and landlords who argued such a measure was merely masquerading as a rent freeze. 
Commissioner Daniel Denvir, the co-chair of the tenant organizing group Reclaim Rhode Island, said he made the recommendation so that landlords can’t evict their renters for arbitrary reasons.
“It is overwhelmingly, emphatically the singular thing that the tenant movement in this state wants,” Denvir said. “You need a just cause to evict someone. You can’t terminate a residency because a landlord said so.”
Just cause legislation was introduced in both chambers in February. The House version is sponsored by Rep. Cherie Cruz, a Pawtucket Democrat, and the Senate bill is sponsored by Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat. Both bills received judiciary committee hearings and were held for further study, as is standard practice when legislation is first vetted by a panel.
The legislation would cap rent increases at 4% annually or 1½ times the annual percentage change in the consumer price index — similar to the yearly cap municipalities face when raising taxes.
The two Realtors on the commission argued that limiting rent increases will hinder property owners from making further investment into new buildings or maintaining existing ones.
“It’s going to diminish housing, diminish the quality of housing, the quantity of housing,” said Commissioner Shannon Elizabeth Weinstein, an associate broker and partner at RentProv Realty.

David Place, a Burrillville Republican; Superior Court Judge Christopher Smith, the commission’s chairman; and Shannon Elizabeth Weinstein, an associate broker and partner at RentProv Realty.

Housing advocates have repeatedly cited rising rents as a major factor in Rhode Island’s growing unhoused population.
“Rents have gone through the roof,” Denvir said. 
The National Low Income Housing Coalition’s latest “Gap” report found that 64% of extremely low-income renters in Rhode Island spend more than half of their income on housing, leaving little for necessities like food and health care. Just 47 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 households with extremely low incomes, according to the report from the Washington D.C.-based nonprofit.
Under the proposals from Cruz and Mack, landlords would have the ability to raise rent above the prescribed percentage. But if they attempt to evict a tenant for failing to pay the excess amount, the housing court would consider it a “rebuttable presumption” that the increase was unreasonable.
Building owners who manage five units or fewer would remain exempt from the proposed legislation.
But Weinstein said the just cause eviction proposal is “rent control with additional restrictions.”
The commission was created through a House resolution last year to address recent disputes between landlords and tenants involving issues like housing discrimination, maintenance dilemmas, late payments, termination of tenancy and security deposits. It has also reviewed existing laws to determine what clarifications may be needed to language governing the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.
Under the House resolution that created the panel, the recommendations were due by May 5. But Rep. David Morales, a Providence Democrat who serves as the commission’s vice chair, told Rhode Island Current the group needed more time to refine and finalize its proposed changes.
“One internal discussion turned to several,” he said in an interview. 
A final report is expected to be completed Wednesday and then published online Thursday. It will include 11 recommendations discussed and debated by the commission. Both landlords and tenant organizations were in agreement on six of them:

Seal eviction records when a case is dismissed.
Seal the names of minors involved in eviction proceedings, and allow individuals aged 18 to 21 with familial ties to a tenant to request that their names also be sealed.
Require landlords to provide a receipt “without delay” after receiving any rental payment made in cash.
Allow existing legal services for tenants facing eviction to continue, subject to available funding and income eligibility. Also consider providing financial assistance and supportive services to help tenants remain housed.
Develop a model form to document tenant repairs.
Seal eviction records when a tenant prevails over their landlord.

Four recommendations came from landlords, over the objections from tenant groups: 

Allow landlords and renters to file an ex parte motion or request a temporary restraining order during eviction proceedings.
Permit rent payments after a lease termination date.
Amending termination notice language to reflect the rental due date as the termination date
Give tenants the option to pay rent into the court registry when a stay of execution is granted in an eviction case.

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for MoveOn)Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said Monday she is charging Rep. LaMonica McIver with “assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement” during the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside a migrant jail in Newark 10 days ago.
Habba also announced her office is dropping Baraka’s misdemeanor trespassing charge “for the sake of moving forward.” Baraka called for federal prosecutors to drop the charge after a court hearing in his case in Newark on Thursday.
The stunning development has McIver accusing the Trump administration of attempting to “criminalize and deter legislative oversight” and Habba saying that congressional oversight is “not an issue in this case.” 
“No one is above the law — politicians or otherwise. It is the job of this office to uphold justice impartially, regardless of who you are,” Habba said in a statement Monday evening. “Now we will let the justice system work.” 
McIver said these charges are purely political.
“This administration will never stop me from working for the people in our district and standing up for what is right,” she said in a statement. “I am thankful for the outpouring of support I have received and I look forward to the truth being laid out clearly in court.”
The charges against McIver stem from a May 9 protest outside Delaney Hall, the new migrant jail in Newark. In the days prior, Baraka had attempted to gain access to the facility, which he claims is operating illegally without proper city permits.
McIver and two other New Jersey Democrats, Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman, joined Baraka that day. Federal agents moved to arrest Baraka, and video of the chaos that ensued shows McIver and other protestors surrounding the mayor. 
While Baraka was still in federal custody, McIver told reporters that she was the one assaulted by federal agents.
“We did not get one apology, we did not get one explanation. I personally, who was assaulted on camera, did not get one apology from any ICE administrator, no call from Homeland Security, nothing,” she said.
Department of Homeland Security officials later posted video of the melee to social media, focusing on a moment where McIver pushes past a federal agent.
McIver said in her statement that she, Menendez, and Watson Coleman were lawfully conducting oversight of the facility and that the visit “should have been peaceful and short.” 
“Instead, ICE agents created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation when they chose to arrest Mayor Baraka,” she said. 
Habba’s statement says she attempted to address these issues without bringing criminal charges and gave McIver “every opportunity to come to a resolution, but she has unfortunately declined.”
The three House members have faced backlash from Republican lawmakers who have introduced a resolution that would strip them of their committee assignments, and at least one representative has called for McIver to be expelled from Congress. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused the three Democrats of “lawlessness.”
Habba’s statement says she has invited Baraka to tour Delaney Hall. 
“The government has nothing to hide at the facility, and I will personally accompany the mayor so he can see that firsthand,” she said. “The citizens of New Jersey deserve unified leadership so we can get to work to keep our state safe.” 
Habba was present in court last week for a 20-minute status conference on Baraka’s charges. Lawyers for Baraka said he was let onto the property by a staff member, and that Baraka was arrested outside the property. Monday was a deadline for federal prosecutors to deliver certain information pertaining to Baraka’s arrest.
Baraka, who is one of six Democrats running for his party’s nomination for governor, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In April, Habba said she launched an investigation into Gov. Phil Murphy and state Attorney General Matt Platkin — which she called “a warning for everybody” — over a 2019 directive barring state, county, and local police from cooperating in federal immigration arrests and enforcement.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2197747697.jpg,,,2025-05-19 21:01:18.078812

(Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)Pennsylvania electricity would be more reliable and affordable if more wind, solar and nuclear power are deployed as the regional grid faces an explosive growth in demand, state lawmakers heard Monday.
Testimony during  a House Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee hearing suggested that Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s proposed legislation to increase the supply of renewable energy would position the commonwealth well to ride out the turbulence. But at least one industry representative pushed back on that premise.
PJM Interconnection, the organization that operates the electricity grid for Pennsylvania and 12 other states, has predicted its peak demand will grow by about 70,000 megawatts to 220,000 megawatts by 2040. The growth is being driven by the increased electrification of transportation and industry and the proliferation of data centers to satisfy the demand for computing power from artificial intelligence and other technologies.
“That’s like building Pennsylvania’s entire existing energy generating fleet, and then some additional 20,000 more megawatts over the next 15 years. That’s a huge amount of growth, and we do need all energy sources to play a part in that,” said Evan Vaughn, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, a nonprofit group representing wind, solar and battery storage developers and advocates for renewable energy growth.
Shapiro’s Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard (PRESS) would create incentives for renewable energy development and add emerging technologies such as next-generation nuclear, fusion, and carbon capture technologies to the state’s range of renewable energy sources. 
First introduced in 2024 and reintroduced as part of Shapiro’s broader Lightning energy plan, PRESS would require 35% of Pennsylvania’s electricity to come from clean sources by 2035. The updated standard would open Pennsylvania to new investment and create 14,500 jobs, the governor’s office said. 
The Lightning plan would employ an existing state program, the Economic Development for a Growing Economy (EDGE) Tax Credit, to to provide up to $100 million per facility for three years to encourage the addition of renewable energy to the grid and additional credits for projects in the two proposed regional hydrogen hubs and for sustainable aviation fuel.
Rep. Danielle Friel-Otten (D-Chester) and Sen. Steve Santarsiero (D-Bucks) are sponsors of companion bills in the House and Senate that would put PRESS into effect. Pennsylvania is not immune from the effects on the price of electricity of the growing global demand for energy and a plateau in petroleum and natural gas production, Friel-Otten said.
“We have an important task ahead of us to increase energy on the grid,” Friel-Otten said. “As we do that, we have a responsibility to continue to do the work to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change.”
Vaughn said there are about 9,600 megawatts of solar, wind and storage capacity projects in the PJM queue in Pennsylvania.
“In many ways those are the fastest projects and the most concrete projects that can be brought online to help meet demand in the next five years or so,” he said, adding that utility scale wind and solar power projects are the least expensive options for new power plants.
Combined with Shapiro’s proposed Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition (RESET) Board, which would serve as a central authority to consider and approve applications for large generating facilities, the planned projects could be online quickly. That legislation was introduced as House Bill 502 by Rep. Mandy Steele (D-Allegheny).
Nick Cohen, president of Doral Renewables, a solar energy production and storage development company in Philadelphia, said local opposition to energy projects often stands in the way of the economic benefits to individual landowners and communities. Pennsylvania would benefit from a state-level reviewing body that other states have empowered to vet energy projects.
“The bill is encouraging. It’s a beacon that goes out to corporations who, in many cases, are the buyers of the energy. And it will bring companies to Pennsylvania who are looking for renewable energy,” Cohen said.
But David Taylor, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association, said the state’s retail choice energy structure has been a success, with electricity prices decreasing significantly since the industry was deregulated in 2005. In the 15 years that followed, greenhouse gas emissions from power generation decreased by more than 44%, Taylor said.
Shapiro’s plan would tamper with that success by placing mandates on the energy industry, forcing the early retirement of reliable generation assets such as natural gas and coal and replace them with what he said were problematic technologies, he said.
“To be clear, this is not an evolution of policy. It’s a revolutionary disruption that would dismantle our competitive electricity markets and replace them with government mandates that distort supply, limit choice and raise costs,” Taylor said.
The RESET Board would streamline the process for building energy projects by speeding permits and reducing red tape. Pennsylvania is one of only 12 states without a state entity to handle siting decisions for major energy projects, according to Shapiro’s office.
Solar and wind would require the development of millions of acres of open land, create waste as technology becomes obsolete and put the United States at the mercy of nations such as China that dominate the production of rare earth elements needed for batteries, Taylor claimed.  
Although Pennsylvania ranks near the bottom among the states in energy from wind, solar and geothermal sources, according to a PennEnvironment analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the goal of 35% renewable energy includes nuclear and is lower than that of neighboring states. New Jersey, for example, has a goal of 50% renewable energy by 2030.
Taylor said he also opposes Shapiro’s plan to offer tax credits for renewable energy projects.
“Every time that the word incentive is used, I hear distortion. You are taking money from the taxpayers and essentially using it to bribe people to make choices that they would not otherwise make. And those things are fundamentally unhealthy for our economy,” Taylor said. 
Rep. Thomas Mehaffie (R-Dauphin) said the unprecedented growth in demand means it’s crucial that the commonwealth act to speed development of all energy sources. 
Mehaffie recalled his sponsorship in 2019 of legislation to update the then-15-year-old precursor to PRESS, the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards, when “a big fight over a bunch of industries wanting more and more” resulted in inaction. 
There’s no more time to fight, he said. 
“Five years ago, we sounded this alarm, and no one did anything … if we continue to stick our head in the sand and do nothing, guess what’s going to happen? Nothing,” Mehaffie said. “And I’ll tell you, what’s going to happen is we’re not going to have power on the grid.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TURBINES-3-1024x670.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 21:01:18.078812

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Abortion pills — and questions over their inherent safety — were back in federal court Monday. Unlike a lawsuit rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court last year, plaintiffs this time are not anti-abortion activists arguing medication abortion should be banned, but abortion providers arguing the remaining restrictions should be lifted to match the drug’s 25-year record of safety and efficacy.
The suit seeks to make abortion pills more accessible by removing several existing restrictions on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s mifepristone-misoprostol regimen first approved in 2000. The drug was approved under the FDA’s drug safety program called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), provisions of which have been steadily eliminated over time but not fully.
On behalf of independent providers in Virginia, Montana, and Kansas, Center for Reproductive Rights senior counsel Linda Goldstein argued the FDA’s most recent evaluations did not properly assess whether remaining restrictions are still medically necessary. She argued that the biggest risks the FDA has identified with mifepristone — serious bleeding and infection — are not exclusive to the drug but with all pregnancy terminations, including spontaneous miscarriages, which she said affected about 25% of all pregnancies. Beyond abortion, for which the drug has captured attention, mifepristone is also used to treat miscarriages so that they conclude safely to help prevent infection.
“The FDA has acknowledged that staying pregnant is more dangerous than not staying pregnant,” said Goldstein, arguing that at minimum the FDA should be required to explain why drugs that pose similar risks are not subject to the same restrictions.
She noted that of the 20,000 drugs the FDA has approved, only 73 have REMS provisions, and that mifepristone has proven to be a safe drug over time. About 7.5 million U.S. patients have taken it as of the end of last year, Goldstein said. As of December 2024, the FDA has reported 36 patient deaths associated with mifepristone since it was first approved in 2000.
Whole Woman’s Health Alliance v. FDA is the first time the U.S. Department of Justice is arguing a position on mifepristone in court since the Trump administration took office. Justice Department attorneys said current regulations are necessary for the most common form of pregnancy termination to be considered safe. When asked by the judge, DOJ attorney Noah Katzen did not confirm or deny whether or not the FDA still considers the drug to be safe and effective overall.
“That is what the FDA determined in the past,” Katzen said during the hearing at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Charlottesville, where the case was originally filed in 2023.
Katzen, the FDA’s former associate chief counsel until 2021 and currently a trial attorney for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the FDA has found that the evidence was “not sufficient” to conclude the REMS are no longer necessary.
U.S. District Judge Robert S. Ballou, appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, appeared more sympathetic to plaintiffs’ argument that some of the requirements appear arbitrary in that they don’t apply to other drugs with equal or greater risk, including drugs his parents have taken.
Ballou did not rule at the end of Monday’s hearing but said he would as soon as possible.
After the hearing, Whole Woman’s Health Alliance founder and president Amy Hagstrom Miller told States Newsroom she took note of Katzen’s response about whether the FDA considers mifepristone to be safe and effective.
“It was an interesting choice of words,” she said.
This lawsuit is among several federal cases involving mifepristone. Earlier this month, the Trump administration filed a brief in the case Missouri v. FDA, requesting the court dismiss three states’ lawsuit to restrict mifepristone on procedural grounds, but did not comment on the merits of the case or explicitly defend the FDA’s current medication abortion policy.
While the Missouri v. FDA lawsuit seeks to reinstate regulations loosened between 2016 and 2021, the Whole Woman’s Health v. FDA lawsuit takes aim at restrictions that require: medical professionals who prescribe mifepristone to register with the drug manufacturer; pharmacies to apply for special certification and maintain copious records, and patients to review and sign a counseling form.
On behalf of plaintiffs, which include Whole Woman’s Health Alliance in Virginia and other states, All Families Healthcare and Blue Mountain Clinic in Montana, and Trust Women in Kansas, Goldstein argued that these existing rules are burdensome and make these medications harder to access by limiting the number of providers and pharmacies who can provide and dispense it and impede access to time-sensitive care.
Goldstein noted the “political climate” surrounding mifepristone and pointed to how abortion opponents seek either rescinding of FDA approval for mifepristone or a return to the in-person dispensing requirements. She added how efforts to make abortion medication more difficult to obtain are outlined in Project 2025 — the conservative Heritage Foundation’s playbook.
Before and especially since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, anti-abortion groups have tried to convince courts that abortion pills, in addition to ending the lives of embryos and fetuses, harm pregnant people at rates that warrant being pulled from the market or at the very least heavily restricted.
During his presidential campaign and since taking office, President Donald Trump and his health appointees have messaged strategically on medication abortion, on the one hand promising to retain its access while also open to examining new evidence suggesting it is unsafe.
Just last week, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would direct the FDA to review abortion pill safety and potentially change its drug label, following the release of an anti-abortion white paper commissioned by far-right funders, whose analysis has been widely criticized by reproductive health scientists and is outflanked by hundreds of studies showing a very low rate of serious adverse events.
 Significant for the South 

Hagstrom Miller called the current restrictions “politically motivated” and said overturning them would be especially significant for Virginia, which as the least restrictive state in the South, has seen an uptick in people traveling from elsewhere to receive care.
“They’re not related to the safety of the medication,” Hagstrom Miller said, of the current restrictions. “We just want to ensure that the most popular method for abortion in Virginia and beyond is protected no matter who sits at the White House and who sits in the FDA.”
Virginia moves to protect reproductive and voting rights, but the fight is far from over

Virginia is in the process of amending its state constitution to enshrine abortion and other reproductive health care procedures or medications. The constitutional amendment passed the legislature on party-line votes this year and must pass again next year before appearing on ballots for voters statewide. Its continued success or failure hinges on the outcome of the state’s competitive House of Delegates elections — where Democrats hold a slim majority.
While governors don’t have a say in constitutional amendments, the issue is a divergence between gubernatorial candidates Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic challenger former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger. This means that should the amendment fail and partisan control of the House shift, whoever is the next governor could advance or block potential future efforts to walk back Virginia’s current abortion access laws.
“It’s really important that we protect that safe access to medication abortion no matter where people live — Virginia is playing a key role in the South right now,” Hagstrom Miller said.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Despite three consecutive bipartisan votes this year to lift a lifetime ban on public food aid for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies, the Legislature on Monday did an about face that put a nail in the bill’s coffin.
The only change between the 32-17 vote on May 14 that favored Legislative Bill 319, noted State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha and others, was a veto by Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen.

“If you change your mind, if you don’t have the backbone to stand by your vote — on food, to people who don’t have it — I don’t really know what you stand for,” DeBoer told colleagues.
Despite pleas by her and others, including the bill’s sponsor, State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue — who invoked several Bible passages about forgiveness — the Legislature voted 24-24 to uphold the governor’s veto. The bill needed 30 votes to override Pillen’s veto.
That means the status quo stands, with state law prohibiting anyone who has been convicted of selling or distributing a controlled substance from accessing SNAP benefits (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program). People with three or more felonies for possessing or using illegal drugs also are ineligible, but state law allows Nebraskans with one or two drug possession or use convictions access to SNAP if they complete a licensed treatment program.
Rountree’s priority bill would have lifted the ban entirely under certain circumstances, such as if the offender completed their criminal sentence or was serving a term of parole or on post-release supervision. Also under Rountree’s bill, a person with three or more felony convictions for drug possession or use had to participate in an accredited substance abuse treatment program unless a health care provider determined it was not needed.
Pillen’s one-page veto letter came just hours after LB 319 had gained 32 of the 25 votes needed at the time to move it to the governor’s desk. Pillen contended that the bill would create “loopholes” where “habitual offenders” could evade treatment.
“Individuals that distribute or sell illicit drugs should not be entitled to taxpayer-funded benefits,” the governor wrote. “Any illegal drug users should be required to complete treatment before they receive their third felony conviction.”
Among those who consistently opposed Rountree’s bill and supported the veto were State Sen. Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area. He fended off colleagues’ criticisms that withholding food as a punishment is “barbaric” and said he was “very comfortable about being uncomfortable” in this situation.

“I’m never going to stop standing up for the victims of these crimes,” he said.
Meanwhile, nonprofits and people affected by the ban voiced disappointment.
Derrick Martinez, a Nebraskan who is SNAP banned, said of today’s action: “We continued on a path doing the same thing that may keep people reoffending out of survival. It’s time to do something better, because the old way has not worked.”
The vote shift by seven Republican legislators who last week voted for the bill came despite being called out by supporters of the bill. The seven: State Sens. Christy Armendariz of Omaha, Stan Clouse of Kearney, Rob Dover of Norfolk, Glen Meyer of Pender, Mike Moser of Columbus; Rita Sanders of Bellevue and Brad von Gillern of Omaha. 
State Sen. John Fredrickson of Omaha said he had never cast a vote based on “fear” of reprisal or political consequences from another elected official.
He said that if LB 319 was a good policy last week, why isn’t it today? He asked colleagues to honor the role the Legislature has as a separate branch of government. 
“We were elected to lead, not to follow, and certainly not to flinch,” Fredrickson said.
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha affirmed her support for the bill and addressed a comment directly to Pillen: “Do you not consider this a pro-life issue? Do you really support life?”
Clouse, of his flip, said he was about “50-50” for the bill before and that the governor’s decision pushed him to the other side.
Said Meyer, “I’m not inclined to override the governor’s veto.” He said he also was swayed after learning later about a federal option that could be available to those the bill sought to help.

Armendariz said she had reservations earlier, and voted against the bill during the initial two rounds of debate. She said she didn’t feel strongly enough for the legislation to go against the governor’s will.
Among Republican lawmakers who stood by their earlier vote to support LB 319 was State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte, who said he had asked Rountree earlier to bolster the bill with a treatment-related requirement, and that Rountree followed through.
Jacobson, in voting to override the veto, said he doubted that many of his colleagues have ever dealt with a friend or loved one suffering from a serious addiction. Because he has, he said that he understands there is no cure — only a vigilant commitment and regimen to stay clean.
“I’ve been around addiction,” Jacobson said. “I would encourage some of you to do the same to really understand why addiction exists.”
State Sen. Sen Megan Hunt of Omaha and others noted that lifting the ban would affect people who had long ago served their sentence related to drugs.
“In Nebraska, this is the only crime where somebody can do their time, pay their debt to society, do their treatment, pay their fines, do everything that the judge, the jury, and the law says that they’re supposed to do —  but they pay the price legally for the rest of their life,” Hunt said.

State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln was among those who talked about “smart justice reform,” noting that SNAP benefits help keep recidivism rates low.
State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County, who opposed the bill from the start, said such support services should be left to private philanthropists and churches.
Rountree — who opened the discussion by calling it a “historic moment” and opportunity to take care of Nebraskans — said he was disappointed for the people of the state and the 1,000 or so who would have benefited by the legislation that had law enforcement support.
Also a minister, Rountree, in an interview with the Nebraska Examiner, called support for the veto a “sign of the times” — government moving  away from taking care of “the least of these.”
Versions of LB 319 have been proposed in years past. Hunt said she has presented one every year since becoming a state senator.
Said Rountree: “These are challenging times for legislation like this. It doesn’t mean we’re going to give up.”



Nonprofits weigh in
Nonprofits in Nebraska that work with inmates reentering society after incarceration said state lawmakers “got it wrong today.”
“When the government continues to make felony convictions and restrictions with no reprieve for anyone who has honestly worked to rebuild their lives, it shows us how out of touch our elected officials are,” said Jasmine Harris, public policy director for one such nonprofit, RISE.
She said to ensure successful reentry, barriers to basic needs must be removed. “Otherwise, people find themselves in predicaments that continue these cycles of incarceration and addiction.”
Eric Savaiano, food and nutrition access manager for Nebraska Appleseed, said that ending the SNAP ban is about ensuring a basic human need. “We won’t stop fighting for this until this ban is gone. It is too important.”
Mindy Rush Chipman, executive director of the ACLU of Nebraska, said no one benefits from the Monday vote.
“The SNAP ban will keep making life harder for struggling Nebraskans, adding food insecurity to the mix of collateral consequences that are already hurting them and their families long after their sentence ended,” she said.

When the Trump administration cut funding for a program that gave food banks money to buy and distribute food from local farmers, Minnesota lawmakers decided to continue the program at the state level. 
The two-year, $115 million state agriculture budget has been approved by the House and Senate and is awaiting the signature of Gov. Tim Walz, and sets up a modest state program to replace the one cut by the federal government.
But Second Harvest Heartland, the biggest hunger relief organization in the state, says the budget still partially defunds the Farm to Food Shelf program, which allowed Second Harvest to purchase excess produce from Minnesota farmers at a steep discount. (The budget boosts funding for a related program for dairy.)
Rep. Fue Lee, DFL-Minneapolis, carried a bill to create a state program that mirrors the endangered federal Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program. Schools, food banks, governments and businesses can apply for grants to purchase food from Minnesota farmers and distribute it for free. Grant recipients must purchase 70% of the food from small farms — those that bring in less than $100,000 per year — or from farmers who rent their land. 
Lee’s bill ended up in the budget, with $1.4 million over two years directed to the Local Food Purchasing Assistance grant program — around half as much as the federal government gave to Minnesota last year for the program.
Minnesota Farmers Union, Land Stewardship Project and Minnesota Farmers Market Association were among the bill’s supporters. 
Zach Rodvold, a lobbyist for Second Harvest Heartland, said the net effect of the budget is a cut in overall food assistance — on top of other federal cuts to food aid, as well as proposed cuts to SNAP, which helps low-income people buy groceries.
“What they voted for was a cut that will cost almost 4 million pounds of produce every year indefinitely,” Rodvold said. 
That’s partly because the dollars that went to the Farm to Food Shelf program stretched farther — the food banks were paying pennies on the dollar for produce that farmers didn’t intend to sell in traditional markets.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A provision to let pipeline companies bypass state permitters is expected to be stripped from the “big, beautiful” federal budget reconciliation bill, but anti-pipeline activists want Congress to kill a carbon tax credit program before they pass the bill along to President Donald Trump.
That was the message from a group of South Dakota carbon dioxide pipeline opponents during a virtual press conference Monday. Representatives from Dakota Rural Action, the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance, and the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association joined the call.
Last week, groups in the anti-carbon pipeline camp raised alarms about the reconciliation bill over a provision tucked within its 1,100 pages. It would have given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority to issue licenses for pipelines carrying natural gas, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oil or other energy products and byproducts.
Is Congress trampling on state laws protecting property rights against pipelines?

The state permitting process has been a political minefield for a proposed carbon pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions that would traverse parts of Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and South Dakota, collecting carbon from ethanol plants on its way to a North Dakota sequestration site. The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission has rejected the project twice.
South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law in March banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies, stripping Summit of the potential use of state court condemnation actions to build beneath land owned by project opponents.
Anticipated removal of federal provision to preempt state regulators
Critics said the federal permitting provision in the reconciliation bill would have allowed Summit to preempt state-level regulations.
The bill passed through a House committee Sunday night. President Trump has called it a “big, beautiful bill” chock full of tax breaks and cuts to wasteful spending; opponents have decried it as a plan to carve large swaths of the citizenry out of programs such as Medicaid. The complex budget reconciliation process allows the majority party to pass legislation with simple majorities in both chambers, avoiding the U.S. Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement.
The federal pipeline preemption provision will be removed in the House Rules Committee on Wednesday morning, according to Kristen Blakely, who works for U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota.
Opponents of the Summit project celebrated that news on the Monday press call.
“It was good to see that they removed the federal siting authority,” said Republican state Sen. Joy Hohn of Hartford.

 Iowa lawmaker reacts
Rep. Charley Thomson, R-Charles City, who has supported eminent domain reform in Iowa and led a group of lawmakers opposed to the pipeline, said it was “good news” the language will be removed.
“I’m very glad to see that, and I think it was not a smart move to put it in there,” Thomson said. “It reeks of desperation.”
Last week the Iowa Legislature approved Thomson’s bill to restrict the use of eminent domain for CO2 pipelines and to offer protections to surrounding landowners.
Thomson said he is “hopeful” Gov. Kim Reynolds, who hasn’t weighed in on the issue, will sign the bill.
“Given that at a minimum, 80% of Iowa supports what’s in the bill, I think it’d be the smart thing to do,” Thomson said, referencing a survey from earlier this year assessing opposition to the use of eminent domain by private corporations to build pipelines.
Thomson said despite critiques of the bill from senators who opposed it on the floor, the bill does a “good thing” and codifies current regulation surrounding pipelines into state statute.

Pipeline opponents remain concerned about one other provision that remains in the bill. It would let pipeline companies pay the federal government $10 million for an “expedited environmental review” lasting one year, with a possible extension of up to six months. The current federal review process can take years. Under the provision, an expedited review’s results would not be appealable.
Summit doesn’t need that level of environmental review, though other pipelines – like the controversial Dakota Access crude oil pipeline that Hohn fought to prevent nearly a decade ago – do need them.
Blakely told Searchlight that the expedited environmental review no longer applies to any carbon pipelines, as it was tied to the now-scuttled preemption provision for permits.
Anti-pipeline groups: Johnson should think of governor’s race
Hohn was elected on a landowner rights platform and helped shepherd the eminent domain ban through the statehouse.
Summit’s business model hinges on the company’s intended collection of billions in 45Q tax credits for companies that sequester carbon, keeping it from contributing to climate change.
Hohn and the others on hand for Monday’s press conference want to see Rep. Johnson push for the elimination of that program, which has existed for decades and was beefed up through former President Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
“We are calling for Rep. Johnson to die on this hill,” said Chase Jensen of Dakota Rural Action, who called the notion of 45Q credits surviving in a U.S. Capitol transfixed by talk of wasteful spending “insane.”
Ed Fischbach, a board member of Dakota Rural Action, called the 45Q program “nothing but corporate welfare.”
Dennis Fieckert of the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance suggested that Johnson’s potential entry into the 2026 South Dakota gubernatorial contest would start off on the wrong foot without a push to end 45Q.
Hohn was one of several state lawmakers who earned their office last year through opposition to eminent domain for carbon pipelines. In that same election, South Dakota voters shot down a law passed by state lawmakers in 2024 that would have granted landowners additional rights but also cleared a path for permitting by Summit.
Rep. Johnson “knows what’s going on here in South Dakota,” Feickert said, adding, “He needs to step up.”
Blakely, Johnson’s spokeswoman, pointed out that the reconciliation bill would alter the tax credit program by limiting access to companies that begin construction within two years of the bill’s enactment. The bill also restricts access to credits by taxpaying companies that are “specified foreign entities” like Chinese defense companies, or taxpaying companies influenced by those entities.
As far as the notion of eliminating 45Q, a statement from Johnson said he’s still working with his colleagues to make the “big, beautiful bill” a “more conservative” piece of legislation.
“I’ve been on the frontlines to help eliminate ridiculous portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, like EV chargers and other Green New Deal policies,” Johnson said.
Jensen, of Dakota Rural Action, said the credits in 45Q didn’t originate with the Green New Deal, the name attached to a set of policies promoted by some of Congress’ more liberal members. The tax credits originated under a bill signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, and were expanded by President Trump during his first term in office before President Biden’s infrastructure bill expanded them further.
“Our congressman continues to make it sound like this is about getting rid of the Green New Deal, and that this is Biden’s fault, but in reality, this is a bipartisan agenda that we are trying to get rid of,” Jensen said.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Midway through May, the top of Glacier National Park’s Logan Pass was shrouded in white.
Monday morning, thin clouds obscured the prominent peaks that guard the Continental Divide, rime ice coated the treetops visible above the snowpack, and snow drifts piled up to the roof of the visitor’s center. On top of a winter’s worth of compacted snow sat a fresh inch or so of powder from the weekend’s storm.
These are the current conditions at the top of the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the iconic alpine highway that bisects the park and during the summer will see hundreds of thousands of visitors a month.
But on Monday, the only people at the pass were a gaggle of media members, four avalanche forecasters, heavy equipment operators and Glacier’s communications team.

“People are just waiting breathlessly for this road to open,” Glacier spokesperson Gina Icenoggle told the Daily Montanan. “Once the road is plowed, the side rails are installed, the visitor center is ready and potable water is available up here, we’ll open it up.”
But that day could be a ways off.
Park officials always refrain from giving an estimated opening date for the Sun Road, due to the variability of late spring conditions at higher elevations.
But data from the previous 92 years since the road opened tells a story of opening dates trending slightly later in the summer.
The average opening date for vehicles to traverse the length of the 50-mile scenic corridor is June 11, but that has trended later in recent decades. The average opening date since 2000 has been June 21, while since 2010 it has been closer to June 26 — due to three mid-July openings, one of which occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Going-to-the-Sun Road hasn’t opened to vehicles in May since 2005.
The monumental task of preparing the serpentine highway for visitors usually begins in March, when snow in the lower valleys begins to melt. On the west side of the Park, a crew of around a dozen, including avalanche forecasters and heavy equipment operators, plow, scoop and dump thousands of tons of snow each day.
Typically, the process begins with a dozer to cut down on the snowpack until it’s only a few feet from the road bed. Rotary snow plows do the bulk of the work at that point, but at certain parts of the road it becomes an all-hands-on-deck operation.
The Big Drift, a one-mile stretch just east of Logan Pass, is known for accumulating up to 80 feet of snow throughout the winter and requires a fleet of excavators and bobcats to punch through.
Because of the steep cliffside nature of the Going-to-the-Sun Road, avalanches are common throughout the spring and early summer, occasionally requiring road crews to double back to stretches of road they’ve previously cleared.
The work can be incredibly dangerous. In 1953, a massive avalanche tumbled down the mountainside into one of the road crews, killing two members, including the foreman, George Beaton.
“It’s a lot safer than it used to be,” said Brian Paul, the park’s road supervisor, due to a team of avalanche forecasters that are part of the crew.
Four avalanche forecasters work in shifts to provide the most accurate data for the road crews, checking overnight temperatures and weather patterns, digging snow pits, and monitoring snowpack along the mountain ridges above the highway. Two forecasters work for the National Park Service, and two are employed by the U. S. Geological Survey.
Every morning, the forecasters on duty will start working around 4:30 to look at what the weather did overnight. They’ll gather data from nearby weather stations and models for the day and put out an internal forecast for park personnel. At 6 a.m., the forecasters will brief the road crew on the day’s conditions, including what parts of the road might be avalanche prone.
“It’s been more of a typical avalanche season year on the Sun Road,” said Erich Peitzch, a USGS snow scientist who manages the park service’s avalanche program and has been forecasting in Glacier since 2007. “We usually get, at some point, a late season snow storm where, you know, it’ll put more avalanche debris on the road.”
During the weekend, new snow triggered a slide on the west side of the Park, shoving 12 feet of debris across the road — a “pretty small avalanche” by Glacier standards, Peitzch said.
“For now, things are relatively stable, but we’re still in the mountains, and the road still passes through dozens of avalanche chutes. And the road is what we call a terrain trap — snow will just pile up when an avalanche comes down and it can get pretty deep.”

After road crews finish clearing snow, and debris, off the road, a series of guardrails are installed along the outer edge of the highway. Eventually, water will flow back to the visitor’s center, the bathrooms will be cleaned and ready and the Park will accept cars along the full length of Going-to-the-Sun Road.

Until then, hikers and bikers are allowed on both the east and west side of Going-to-the-Sun Road past the marked vehicle closures. Hiker/Biker closures are in place on weekdays until 4 p.m., after which visitors can continue up the road until reaching the avalanche hazard closure. Going past the avalanche closures is punishable by a $5,000 fine and as long as six months in jail. The latest conditions for the road can be viewed online.
And while no one can say for certain when visitors will be able to drive up to Logan Pass this summer, park officials assure the public it will be as soon as safely possible.
“So many surrounding businesses and the local economy counts on this road being open,” Icenoggle said. “When it’s go time, it’s go time.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Glacier_Plow-1024x651.jpg,,,2025-05-19 20:04:27.936559

Here are some of the bills Reynolds signed Monday:
K-12 public school funding
Iowa lawmakers sent Reynolds Senate File 167, the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) rate for the 2025-2026 school year, in April. The legislation came to the governor much later than in many previous years — the Legislature has a self-imposed deadline to pass the SSA rate for the upcoming school year within 30 days of the governor’s budget being released in January, though there is no penalty for failing to meet this target.
This year, House and Senate Republicans reached an agreement setting the SSA rate for the upcoming school year at 2%, an increase of $157 per K-12 student for the per-pupil funding mechanism for Iowa schools. The bill also included some funding components for Iowa schools that Republicans said will help address inequities with rural school district funding, including a $5 bump to the State Cost Per Pupil (SCPP) and a 5% increase to the rate of funding per pupil to the transportation equity fund.
Democrats said the 2% rate will not provide enough funding for schools, saying that 159 Iowa school districts will be on the budget guarantee for the upcoming school year — a process that increases local property taxes when school districts’ funding needs are not met by state aid.
Anti-SLAPP protections
The governor also signed House File 472 into law, a measure targeting “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” also known as SLAPP lawsuits. SLAPP cases are civil lawsuits filed by businesses, individuals or organizations against news organizations and activists that are typically a means to try to silence these entities from publishing stories or making public statements about a specific topic. The lawsuits are not filed necessarily with the intention to win in court, but as a means to draw down time and money from the people being sued to prevent them from continuing to report or talk about a subject.
The law is a way to provide protections for defendants in these cases by giving courts the ability to grant expedited relief in cases involving First Amendment rights, like the freedoms of speech and press.
This is a bill that has come up in multiple previous legislative sessions, but did not receive Senate approval until this year. Discussions in Iowa started on SLAPP lawsuits after a 2018 case in which a Carroll police officer sued the Carroll Times Herald when the newspaper reported he had sexual relationships with teenagers — information the officer confirmed was true. The judge had dismissed the lawsuit, but the Carroll Times Herald accrued more than $100,000 in legal fees, nearly putting the paper out of business.
Local restrictions on fireworks
Senate File 303 prevents Iowa cities and counties from prohibiting or limiting the use of fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31.
Iowans must still follow state laws regulating the use of fireworks, like a ban on fireworks sales to minors or the use of “display” fireworks without local permission, during these three days. However, other further restrictions could not be set by local jurisdictions.
Several cities in Iowa, like Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City, have more restrictions or total bans on the use of fireworks that would no longer be enforceable on these three days. Local rules could still be enforced during other periods when fireworks are permitted for legal use by the state — from June 1 through July 8 and Dec. 10 through Jan. 3 of each year.
During floor debate on the bill, Republican lawmakers supporting the measure said this change was necessary to allow Iowans to fully participate in the the country’s 250th anniversary, referring to President Donald Trump’s idea to begin celebrations at the Iowa State Fair for the “Great American State Fair” from Memorial Day 2025 to July 4, 2026.

Moscow residents gathered Saturday to unite against Christian nationalism, the third such community-building event in seven months.
Titled, “United in Community,” the sold-out event’s aim was to bring people together to discuss democracy and the community’s future.
“After the first two gatherings, organizers received emails and comments asking ‘what can we do?’” said Joann Muneta, chair of the Latah County Human Rights Task Force.

Saturday’s event aimed to answer that question.
“So I want us to kind of dig in and try to see if we can understand this phenomenon (Christian nationalism), and particularly in the American context, and most importantly, equip you with some strategies to resist it while building the inclusive democracy,” said Political Strategist Scot Nakagawa, who keynoted the event.
 Moscow’s experience could have national significance

Nakagawa, who lives in Oregon, co-founded the 22nd Century Initiative, a national strategy center working to resist authoritarianism.
He emphasized that Moscow’s efforts have significance beyond the city’s limits.
“I think that it does have really broad national implications, and what you do here will be resonant throughout the country,” he said.
Moscow is home to Christ Church, whose members own about 20% of downtown Moscow’s buildings and operate various businesses locally, ranging from construction to restaurants. The church, led by Pastor Doug Wilson, is widely recognized as a significant force within the Christian nationalist movement in the United States.
Nakagawa noted that Christ Church and its affiliated congregations represent only 5% of Moscow’s population, yet wield disproportionate influence.
“… There is this kind of message about minority rule that I think is really resonant with most people in the United States,” he said, adding that many local businesses have been displaced as the church bought buildings and made them unavailable to other enterprises.
While Moscow’s situation may seem unique, Nakagawa argued it reflects broader trends occurring worldwide.
He framed the rise of Christian nationalism as part of a global phenomenon affecting multiple religions, not just an isolated American issue. He cited what scholars call the “multiple modernities crisis” — the collision between ancient faith traditions and the dislocating forces of globalization, digital information systems and rapid cultural change.
These forces, he said, are causing people to feel culturally displaced while driving economic insecurity and inequality worldwide.
“Digital technology has shattered traditional gatekeepers of religious knowledge. Anyone now with a smartphone can claim prophetic authority,” Nakagawa explained, noting how this democratization of religious interpretation has also unleashed authoritarian voices.
He described theocratic movements as offering “promises of restored order” and “easy answers and divine protection” to people whose traditional communities feel under assault from rapid economic change.
 Building coalitions across ideological differences and creating alliances

Nakagawa outlined several strategies for how to fight theocracy in Moscow. He advocated for building coalitions across ideological differences, and creating unlikely alliances around shared democratic values.
He also stressed the importance of local electoral engagement.
“Run candidates for school boards, state legislatures and courts and particularly for small offices,” he said, noting that people in those positions “can drive transparency and public participation in a way that could restore or build trust in those institutions by making them accountable.”
After the keynote, attendees heard from local organizations who are committed to supporting an inclusive region. They were also given a list of these organizations; about 30 groups were listed.

The Rev. Mary Jane Miles from the Nez Perce Tribe, and a Presbyterian pastor, addressed the gathering about overcoming division through understanding rather than contempt.
Miles, who recently stepped down from the Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee after turning 85, shared her perspective on battling hatred with a different approach.
“Contempt is no match for love,” she said.
Miles emphasized that practicing kindness can become transformative.
“It’s hard to be nice if I hate you, but once you get into the practice of being nice, it grows on you,” she told the audience.
She also highlighted gratitude as a powerful tool for change.
“Gratitude is a contempt killer. The key to being nicer and happier is gratitude,” she said.
Miles connected this message to the broader American promise, saying, “We are always promised life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I love that pursuit of happiness, and that’s what we are doing here. We want to go back to the pursuit of happiness and have a happy life together with each other.”
After hearing from Miles and other supporters, attendees dispersed into breakout sessions, including “addressing theocracy,” “supporting public schools,” and “finding common ground.” FāVS was not permitted to attend these sessions, so that guests could have privacy.
Dale Gentry, who helped organize the event, said the hope was that through these breakouts, the community could come up with next steps.
United in Community was organized by the Latah County Human Rights Task Force and the United Church of Moscow. Saturday’s event was a follow up to the United Against Hate Summit in September 2024 and a presentation on Religious Extremism in December 2024.

(Photo illustration via Getty Images)Frustration. Defeat. Uncertainty about whether they will be able to complete their goals. These are some of the feelings University of Iowa Student Body President Thomas Knudsen said fellow UI student have expressed to him as they watch tuition and fees rise along with many other expenses.
Knudsen, a junior at the UI, shared stories Monday with the Iowa Board of Regents of students trying to find ways to make ends meet. He said in the years since he first enrolled at the university, the cost of attendance has risen by about $1,200.
“We know these decisions are not made lightly, and we understand that maintaining a high quality education requires resources, but it’s essential to remember that behind these numbers are real students,” Knudsen said.
Student leaders who spoke to the Iowa Board of Regents called for transparency, consistency and investment in Iowa’s future, rather than placing more cost burdens on those who will ensure it. The board received the universities’ proposed tuition and fee increases last month for the upcoming academic year and will vote on whether to approve them in June.
Each of the state’s public universities will implement tuition and fee increases under the proposal, with the UI and Iowa State University planning 3% tuition increases for in-state, undergraduate students and the University of Northern Iowa offering a 2.7% increase for the same population.

If approved, the increase at the UI would add $279 to tuition, Knudsen said. While it doesn’t seem like too much for one year, he said for many students “it’s the difference between pursuing a four-year degree or pursuing some sort of alternative option.”
He urged the board, if the tuition increases are approved, to be transparent with students as to where their money is going, prioritize support for low-income and first-generation students and keep advocating for increased funding from the state.
“Tuition should not always be the go-to solution when budgets are tight,” Knudsen said. “When higher education is a public good, it deserves consistent support from the state.”
Gabriel Salazar, UNI student body vice president, said rising costs won’t just impact current students, but could damage enrollment and overall draw to the state. About 80% of UNI graduates stay in Iowa after completing their studies, Salazar said, and even a couple hundred dollars could be the difference between students choosing to come to Iowa, driving success in the state, or going somewhere else.
“Every cent put into our universities is an investment in our state’s current economy and future prosperity,” Salazar said. “If the cost of education continues to rise, it can lead to students leaving to another state where they would miss out on the quality education that our fine regents institutions have to offer.”
This applies to graduate and professional students as well as undergraduates, said Airiana Mohr, incoming vice president of UI Graduate & Professional Student Government. She asked the board to keep tuition flat for the upcoming academic year to help students dealing with the uncertainty of federal funding and other impacts to their work.
Both Mohr and Muhammad Azhan, representing graduate and professional students at ISU, pointed out that graduate and professional students often have additional costs to consider, like families, transportation and more. Graduate students also contribute immense amounts of work to their institutions, Azhan said.
Azhan said he and other students are asking the board for a pause in hiking costs in order to consider other options for keeping universities going without asking for more from students to do so.
“Preserving accessibility means more than … staying below the national average, it means ensuring that students can realistically afford to live based on their income and thrive here in Iowa, to contribute to the Iowa workforce,” Azhan said. “If you want to remain competitive and continue attracting top talent from across the country and around the world, we must recognize that affordability is one of the most important factors in recruitment and retention.”
Board moves ahead with Wintersteen retirement
The board also voted Monday to accept ISU President Wendy Wintersteen’s intention to retire and begin the process of searching for a new university head.
After more than 45 years at ISU and nine serving as its president, Wintersteen announced May 16 she plans to retire in January 2026. Board President Sherry Bates said in the Monday meeting Wintersteen’s efforts while heading ISU have maintained the institution’s place as one of the top land-grant universities in the U.S.
With the board’s approval, Iowa Board of Regents Executive Director Mark Braun will begin the process of finding a firm to conduct the search for Wintersteen’s replacement, form a search committee and develop a timetable for the search.
“Obviously, this isn’t President Wintersteen’s last meeting, and we look forward to continuing to work with her as we begin the transition to ISU’s next leader, but as her time winds down, I want to publicly acknowledge how much she has meant to our board and the state of Iowa,” Bates said. “She has been a tremendous president for ISU, and we will miss her greatly. I, along with past and current board members, have greatly enjoyed working with her and wish her well in her retirement.”

Greg Gianforte.
Sen. Willis Curdy, D-Missoula, said Monday he had worked on Senate Bill 390 for several sessions with support from youth advocates and public health workers.
“This is long overdue,” Curdy said.
The law now defines “smoking,” which is prohibited indoors, to include using an electronic smoking device.
The bill was one of a couple pieces of legislation in 2025 tied to the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act. However, Senate Bill 150, to create an exemption in the act that allowed for cigar rooms, failed in its last vote during the legislative session.
 ‘A matter of perseverance’ 
Curdy said SB 390 was near and dear to him as a former high school teacher, and he and former legislator Fred Anderson, a Great Falls Republican and school principal, had talked about the effects on youth.
“I got some support from folks — quite a bit of support from folks — who had in the past opposed the bill,” Curdy said.
He said some previous opponents came around after “an epiphany with their own health,” and others after learning about the negative health consequences of e-cigarettes and vape pens.
Curdy also said more work needs to be done to strengthen the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act, and he is interested in additional legislation, although he declined to cite specifics Monday.
However, he said persistence at the Montana Legislature paid off with SB 390.
“It was a matter of perseverance,” Curdy said.
 Cigar bar bill failed, but will return 
After clearing the Senate, a bill that would have created an exception in the Montana Clean Indoor Air Act for cigar rooms failed in the House in its last vote after some representatives changed their votes.
Sponsored by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, the bill passed the House on second reading with 51 votes, but then it failed with only 45 votes in support on third reading.
The bill was backed by the tourism and hospitality industry, and supporters argued Montana is at a disadvantage as a luxury destination because it cannot offer a place where cigar aficionados can legally smoke indoors.
Public health advocates opposed the bill, pointing to detrimental effects of second-hand smoke. Some also alleged the bill would run contrary to an agreement made when Montana first passed the Clean Indoor Air Act in 2005 but gave bars four years to comply.
Originally, the bill would have allowed cigar bars in standalone structures, but it was amended to create an exception for cigar rooms with separate ventilation instead.
Galt said Monday he believes that change, along with an amendment that included a study related to gambling machines and opposed by the industry, might have ended up sinking the bill.
Galt has worked on the bill for many sessions, and he earlier said cigar bars are legal in many other states. He said Monday he’ll continue to pursue the opportunity for Montana.
“I do intend on running it again next session with some of the amendments we worked on,” Galt said in a text message Monday. “Tenth year may be my lucky year.”
Jackie Semmens, with the American Heart Association, had opposed SB 150 during the Montana Legislature.
Semmens said Monday an amendment in the House Business and Labor Committee “would have essentially brought back smoking sections to Montana bars.”
But she said “there is no safe level of second-hand smoke,” and she believes the change might have contributed to the demise of the bill.
“This really upset our members, who called their legislators to ask them to vote ‘no’ on SB 150,” said Semmens, government relations director for Montana for the association. “Montanans by and large don’t want to return to the days of smoking in bars.”
However, in a phone call and email, Semmens also praised the addition of e-cigarettes to the Clean Indoor Air Act.
“We believe that the addition of e-cigarettes to the Clean Indoor Air Act was an important update to the law given the youth vaping epidemic,” Semmens said. “Nicotine in any form is an addictive drug, and we want to send a clear message to youth in Montana that vaping is not safe for you or for people around you.
“We also hope this will inspire more interest in what else Montana can do to help curb the youth vaping epidemic.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/E_Cigarettes_Ego_Vaporizers_and_Box_Mods_17679064871.jpg,,,2025-05-19 20:04:27.936559

An official with the state’s emergency response agency worried about costs if a wildfire, tornado or any other disaster were to devastate a small Wyoming town.
The post Proposed FEMA change could leave Wyoming towns in trouble when disasters damage public infrastructure appeared first on WyoFile .","In an effort to slash spending by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, White House officials are considering drastically raising the threshold for how much damage a natural disaster must cause before local governments will qualify for federal help rebuilding. 
Under the new proposed criteria, Wyoming’s state and local governments wouldn’t have been eligible for federal compensation for public infrastructure losses in recent disasters of note — including last year’s historic wildfires and flooding in 2023 and 2017 — an official with the Wyoming Department of Homeland Security told a state legislative committee Monday. 
Under the current calculation, a disaster has to do more than $1.1 million in damage to public infrastructure before Wyoming can turn to the federal government for help. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering changing that threshold to $4.4 million, according to an internal memo reported on by CNN.
Wyoming, with its wide open spaces, reaches the current threshold much less often than more crowded and urban states, where wildfires, hurricanes and other natural disasters can damage swathes of infrastructure quickly.

The most recent example is last August’s wildfires in northeastern Wyoming. Those fires cost the state tens of millions of dollars to fight, and did tens of millions of dollars more in damage to ranch land and other private property. In the grand scheme of those costs, public infrastructure losses were relatively slight, Ashley Paulsrud, the Wyoming Department of Homeland Security’s finance section chief, told WyoFile. 
The fires burned the power lines and poles of a rural electric company, Paulsrud said, and the price tag for damage extended above $1.1 million, but remained considerably below $2 million. Then-President Joe Biden awarded the federal disaster designation last year, covering the utility’s rebuilding cost.
But Paulsrud worried about what could occur if a wildfire, tornado or any other disaster were to devastate one of Wyoming’s small or medium towns. The disaster could cause immense destruction to towns with limited municipal budgets, while still not doing enough damage to hit the federal government’s proposed new threshold. That might leave the town reliant on the state to cover rebuilding costs. 
The prospect that Wyoming could be shut out of federal relief in such a case is “pretty scary,” Paulsrud told the Joint Judiciary Committee on Monday during its meeting in Torrington. It is just one area in which the Trump administration’s efforts to slash federal spending could cut into her office’s work in Wyoming, Paulsrud said.

The Wyoming Department of Homeland Security receives 92% of its funding from the federal government, Paulsrud said. It is also the administrator of federal grant programs that fund emergency service personnel for local governments. Many of those funding streams are in doubt, Paulsrud said. Normally at this point in the year, the agency would have insight into its funding for the coming one, she said, but the state has not received word on those grants.
Trump and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been critical of FEMA and have promised to dramatically reduce the agency’s funding. So far, the proposals floated publicly indicate they propose to do so by shifting the cost burden for recovering from disasters to the states impacted by them. 
The move to raise the threshold for public assistance funding comes as Trump has rejected providing federal disaster designations to at least three states already during his second term, according to CNN. Trump rejected a request from Washington state for a major disaster declaration in the wake of a destructive winter storm last year. He also rejected requests from Arkansas and Kentucky for the designation in the wake of severe storms and tornadoes that killed more than 40 people across four states and ravaged some towns.
In Wyoming, last year’s wildfire season was particularly severe and drained nearly all of the state’s disaster response coffers. Gov. Mark Gordon used virtually all of the funds available to him for emergencies to respond to the disasters, he told lawmakers ahead of the 2025 legislative session. 
Legislators restored that emergency funding and granted the governor the ability to draw up to $30 million from the state’s rainy day fund if future wildfires draw those accounts down again. They also created both a grant and a loan program to help impacted ranchers recover. Those discussions were contentious during the legislative session, with many lawmakers reluctant to create a grant program that would help property owners and businesses recover from the wildfires.  
Wyoming is one of five western states without a state-funded disaster recovery program to address calamities that do not meet the requirements for federal disaster assistance.
Paulsrud told lawmakers her department may ask for a significant increase in state funding this year, given the possibility Wyoming won’t be able to count on the federal government for future disaster relief. “Most likely our budget ask will be a lot different this year,” she said.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Progressive North Dakotans who brainstormed ideas for the next legislative session want lawmakers to focus on three areas: strong schools, economic security and personal freedom.
About 40 people broke into small groups at the North Dakota Heritage Center on Friday to discuss what they believe are the most pressing issues facing the state. The discussion was part of a community-led event called the People’s Session.
Erin Oban, a former Democratic state senator and teacher, said students going through the K-12 system have vastly different needs.
“There is strong public support for our public schools,” Oban said. “The challenge is that is not necessarily reflected in the decision-making process and funding that is coming, particularly from the state level.”
She added teachers are being underfunded and some have needed to take second jobs to make ends meet.
“We think that is horrible and quite a reflection on how we value teaching as a profession,” she said.

Barry Nelson, a community organizer for the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, told event attendees that pre-K and early childhood education in the state need to be expanded.
About 62,000 kids in North Dakota are under age 6, but there are only about 38,000 licensed early childhood education slots in the state, he said. 
“The data shows that effective early childhood education increases income, reduces poverty, reduces teenage pregnancies and boosts economic productivity,” Nelson said.
Other education suggestions included creating incentives for businesses to hire international students who study in North Dakota to keep them in-state after they graduate. It also was suggested that North Dakota, in coordination with the federal government, should be able to issue a certain amount of work visas to international graduates.
Another attendee suggested addressing a shortage of lawyers with student loan forgiveness for North Dakota law school graduates and other professions if they stay in the state for five years.
Other policy suggestions included taxing out-of-state interests at a higher rate than North Dakota residents or businesses, raising the minimum wage to a livable wage and prohibiting businesses from paying tipped workers below minimum wage.

Those speaking on personal freedom wanted more pushback against the state’s abortion law and other laws targeting gender-affirming care or health care-related issues.
Advocacy organizations hosting the event included the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, Gender Justice, Prairie Action, American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota and North Dakota AFL-CIO.
Dalton Erickson, executive director for the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, said the state has a citizen Legislature, which means the common people are supposed to have their voices heard for 80 days in Bismarck, every two years.
He said one of the purposes of the event was not only to hear concerns from the public, but to better organize policy proposals ahead of the next legislative session in 2027. Erickson added they will put many of the suggestions into bill draft form over the next year and will revisit the issues in spring 2026.
“I think we have a lot of excited people and a lot of great ideas to work off of,” he said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A provision to let pipeline companies bypass state permitters is expected to be stripped from the “big, beautiful” federal budget reconciliation bill, but anti-pipeline activists want Congress to kill a carbon tax credit program before they pass the bill along to President Donald Trump.
That was the message from a group of South Dakota carbon dioxide pipeline opponents during a virtual press conference Monday. Representatives from Dakota Rural Action, the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance, and the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association joined the call.
Last week, groups in the anti-carbon pipeline camp raised alarms about the reconciliation bill over a provision tucked within its 1,100 pages. It would have given the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission exclusive authority to issue licenses for pipelines carrying natural gas, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, oil or other energy products and byproducts.
Is Congress trampling on state laws protecting property rights against pipelines?

The state permitting process has been a political minefield for a proposed carbon pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions that would traverse parts of Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and South Dakota, collecting carbon from ethanol plants on its way to a North Dakota sequestration site. The South Dakota Public Utilities Commission has rejected the project twice.
South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill into law in March banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies, stripping Summit of the potential use of state court condemnation actions to build beneath land owned by project opponents.
Anticipated removal of federal provision to preempt state regulators
Critics said the federal permitting provision in the reconciliation bill would’ve allowed Summit to preempt state-level regulations.
The bill passed through a House committee Sunday night. President Trump has called it a “big, beautiful bill” chock full of tax breaks and cuts to wasteful spending; opponents have decried it as a plan to carve large swaths of the citizenry out of entitlement programs such as Medicaid. The complex budget reconciliation process allows the majority party to pass legislation with simple majorities in both chambers, avoiding the U.S. Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement.
The federal pipeline preemption provision will be removed in the House Rules Committee on Wednesday morning, according to Kristen Blakely, who works for U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota.
Opponents of the Summit project celebrated that news on the Monday press call.
“It was good to see that they removed the federal siting authority,” said Republican state Sen. Joy Hohn of Hartford.
Pipeline opponents remain concerned about one other provision that remains in the bill. It would let pipeline companies pay the federal government $10 million for an “expedited environmental review” lasting one year, with a possible extension of up to six months. The current federal review process can take years. Under the provision, an expedited review’s results would not be appealable.
Summit doesn’t need that level of environmental review, though other pipelines – like the controversial Dakota Access crude oil pipeline that Hohn fought to prevent nearly a decade ago – do need them.
Blakely told Searchlight that the expedited environmental review no longer applies to any carbon pipelines, as it was tied to the now-scuttled preemption provision for permits.
Anti-pipeline groups: Johnson should think of governor’s race
Hohn was elected on a landowner rights platform and helped shepherd the eminent domain ban through the statehouse.
Summit’s business model hinges on the company’s intended collection of billions in 45Q tax credits for companies that sequester carbon, keeping it from contributing to climate change.
Hohn and the others on hand for Monday’s press conference want to see Rep. Johnson push for the elimination of that program, which has existed for decades and was beefed up through former President Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Race for South Dakota governor could be a race for Trump’s favor

“We are calling for Rep. Johnson to die on this hill,” said Chase Jensen of Dakota Rural Action, who called the notion of 45Q credits surviving in a U.S. Capitol transfixed by talk of wasteful spending “insane.”
Ed Fischbach, a board member of Dakota Rural Action, called the 45Q program “nothing but corporate welfare.”
Dennis Fieckert of the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance suggested that Johnson’s potential entry into the 2026 South Dakota gubernatorial contest would start off on the wrong foot without a push to end 45Q.
Hohn was one of several state lawmakers who earned their office last year through opposition to eminent domain for carbon pipelines. In that same election, South Dakota voters shot down a law passed by state lawmakers in 2024 that would have granted landowners additional rights but also cleared a path for permitting by Summit.
Rep. Johnson “knows what’s going on here in South Dakota,” Feickert said, adding, “He needs to step up.”
Blakely, Johnson’s spokeswoman, pointed out that the reconciliation bill would alter the tax credit program by limiting access to companies that begin construction within two years of the bill’s enactment. The bill also restricts access to credits by taxpaying companies that are “specified foreign entities” like Chinese defense companies, or taxpaying companies influenced by those entities.
As far as the notion of eliminating 45Q, a statement from Johnson said he’s still working with his colleagues to make the “big, beautiful bill” a “more conservative” piece of legislation.
“I’ve been on the frontlines to help eliminate ridiculous portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, like EV chargers and other Green New Deal policies,” Johnson said.
Jensen, of Dakota Rural Action, said the credits in 45Q didn’t originate with the Green New Deal, the name attached to a set of policies promoted by some of Congress’ more liberal members. The tax credits originated under a bill signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, and were expanded by President Trump during his first term in office before President Biden’s infrastructure bill expanded them further.
“Our congressman continues to make it sound like this is about getting rid of the Green New Deal, and that this is Biden’s fault, but in reality, this is a bipartisan agenda that we are trying to get rid of,” Jensen said.

House Bill 25-1171 adds the offense to the list of crimes covered by the Possession of Weapon by Previous Offender statute in the state. POWPO makes it illegal to own a firearm for people with one or more of the listed convictions on their record.
“From now on anyone convicted of first degree motor vehicle theft (is) ineligible to possess a firearm, keeping guns out of the wrong hands and protecting our communities,” Polis said in a statement. “I am proud of our work to improve public safety in Colorado, and with this bill signed into law, I look forward to continuing our bold progress to protect Coloradans and our communities.”

A person can be convicted of first-degree vehicle theft only after two other vehicle theft convictions.
The bill was sponsored by Reps. Shannon Bird of Westminster and Andrew Boesenecker of Fort Collins and Sens. Nick Hinrichsen of Pueblo and Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City, all Democrats. It passed the Legislature with bipartisan support.
A 2021 law narrowed the scope of the POWPO application in Colorado, and while a 2022 law then added more felonies back to the list, it left car theft out.
“What we heard in committee from law enforcement is a plea. They are begging us, in these situations where you have someone who has been convicted three times of auto theft, they are asking us to please take the firearm out of the equation,” Boesenecker said on the House floor during bill debate.










What we heard in committee from law enforcement is a plea. They are begging us, in these situations where you have someone who has been convicted three times of auto theft, they are asking us to please take the firearm out of the equation.


– State Rep. Andrew Boesenecker


As the bill made its way through the Legislature, Hinrichsen said that car theft is distinct from other property crimes and non-violent offenses left out of POWPO.
“When we look at punishments relative to crime, either in terms of sentences or in terms of restrictions, what we should be looking at is the severity of the action and the risk and harm done to the victim and community more broadly. When you’re dealing with the theft of a vehicle, you’re disrupting the entire life of an individual,” he said during the bill’s first Senate committee hearing.
The bill was amended in the House, under a change brought by Republican representatives, to allow a person to petition a court to restore their firearm possession rights after 10 years.
“This is the crucially important piece — for someone who has turned their life around, they can petition to get this removed,” Rep. Ryan Armagost, a Berthoud Republican who helped negotiate the amendment, said on the House floor.
But that amendment ended up being a sticking point. Other crimes on the POWPO list do not have that restoration pathway for adults, creating equal protection concerns. Sponsors said, however, that the attorney general’s office said the bill with the amendment is defensible if a legal challenge emerges.
But the Senate stripped the amendment from the bill and passed a version without the restoration piece. The House then refused to accept the change and forced the Senate to decide, in the last hours of the session on May 7, to either pass the House version of the bill or allow the legislation to die. The Senate passed the bill.
“I appreciate the hard work of the House sponsors to work on deals that bring parties into agreement, that brought representatives to be able to get behind this policy that I believe will save lives in Colorado,” Hinrichsen said.

Anti-pipeline groups: Johnson should think of governor’s race
Hohn was elected on a landowner rights platform and helped shepherd the eminent domain ban through the statehouse.
Summit’s business model hinges on the company’s intended collection of billions in 45Q tax credits for companies that sequester carbon, keeping it from contributing to climate change. 
Hohn and the others on hand for Monday’s press conference want to see Rep. Johnson push for the elimination of that program, which has existed for decades and was beefed up through former President Joe Biden’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
Race for South Dakota governor could be a race for Trump’s favor

“We are calling for Rep. Johnson to die on this hill,” said Chase Jensen of Dakota Rural Action, who called the notion of 45Q credits surviving in a U.S. Capitol transfixed by talk of wasteful spending “insane.”
Ed Fischbach, a board member of Dakota Rural Action, called the 45Q program “nothing but corporate welfare.”
Dennis Fieckert of the South Dakota Property Rights and Local Control Alliance suggested that Johnson’s potential entry into the 2026 South Dakota gubernatorial contest would start off on the wrong foot without a push to end 45Q. 
Hohn was one of several state lawmakers who earned their office last year through opposition to eminent domain for carbon pipelines. In that same election, South Dakota voters shot down a law passed by state lawmakers in 2024 that would have granted landowners additional rights but also cleared a path for permitting by Summit.
Rep. Johnson “knows what’s going on here in South Dakota,” Feickert said, adding, “He needs to step up.”
Blakely, Johnson’s spokeswoman, pointed out that the reconciliation bill would alter the tax credit program by limiting access to companies that begin construction within two years of the bill’s enactment. The bill also restricts access to credits by taxpaying companies that are “specified foreign entities” like Chinese defense companies, or taxpaying companies influenced by those entities.
As far as the notion of eliminating 45Q, a statement from Johnson said he’s still working with his colleagues to make the “big, beautiful bill” a “more conservative” piece of legislation.
“I’ve been on the frontlines to help eliminate ridiculous portions of the Inflation Reduction Act, like EV chargers and other Green New Deal policies,” Johnson said.
Jensen, of Dakota Rural Action, said the credits in 45Q didn’t originate with the Green New Deal, the name attached to a set of policies promoted by some of Congress’ more liberal members. The tax credits originated under a bill signed by President George W. Bush in 2008, and were expanded by President Trump during his first term in office before President Biden’s infrastructure bill expanded them further.
“Our congressman continues to make it sound like this is about getting rid of the Green New Deal, and that this is Biden’s fault, but in reality, this is a bipartisan agenda that we are trying to get rid of,” Jensen said.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Labor advocates scored a win on Monday after Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a new law to extend unemployment benefits to striking workers in Washington. 
The governor’s conference room was packed with advocates and lawmakers who gathered to see Ferguson sign the law with his blue felt tip pen. 
“Allowing striking workers to access unemployment insurance benefits creates a more level playing field for workers to have the resources they need to effectively bargain for better working conditions,” Ferguson said before putting his signature on Senate Bill 5041. 
The new law goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2026 and is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2035. Washington joins New York and New Jersey as the only states that provide such benefits to striking workers.
The bill generated controversy during the legislative session, with Republicans and business groups opposing the idea, arguing that it will encourage more workers to go on strike and ​​result in higher costs for businesses.
Democrats and labor advocates say this law will disincentivize bad faith behavior by employers and encourage them to engage with their workers. 
“No one wants to go out on strike,” said April Sims, president of the Washington State Labor Council. “Going out on strike is the absolute last resort, and workers that strike do so because there is simply no other option.”
The bill went through several rounds of negotiations over how long workers could collect unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is typically available for up to 26 weeks. 
When the bill first passed the Senate, the benefits would be extended for up to 12 weeks for strikers. But when it passed the House, the threshold was lowered to four weeks. Lawmakers ultimately settled on six weeks. 
Workers will be eligible for unemployment benefits starting 15 to 21 days after the strike begins, depending on the day the strike starts. If the contract is resolved before that time, benefits will not be issued.
The benefits will also be extended to workers affected by an employer-initiated lockout, something labor advocates point to as a tactic businesses use to put pressure on workers during contract negotiations.
The state’s Employment Security Department will also be required to submit annual reports to the Legislature with data on the number of strikes in the state and the cost of benefits for striking workers for Washington’s unemployment insurance trust fund, which is funded by a tax on employers.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2645-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 19:04:58.105776

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe town of Colchester has appealed to the Vermont Supreme Court a lower court decision that found town officials acted in bad faith when they tried to seize waterfront property in an eminent domain proceeding.The appeal continues a long legal saga that began in 2022, when the Mallet’s Bay waterfront property owner, Mongeon Bay Properties, sued the town after officials there started eminent domain proceedings.The property, at 885 East Lakeshore Dr., is not used as a permanent residence but is part of a larger unsubdivided parcel that hosts a mix of rental housing, seasonal housing and single-family homes.Superior Court Judge Samuel Hoar Jr. in March criticized the town’s efforts to condemn the property, and in a decision halting the proceedings said the proposed taking was made in “bad faith.”He further suggested in his decision that town officials used eminent domain in retaliation for a previous legal dispute with the property owner.Attorneys for the town, in their appeal to the Supreme Court, said there is “considerable evidence demonstrating the town’s position that it was necessary to take the property,” according to court documents.READ MORE
The town is asking the state’s highest court to weigh whether the trial court “abused its discretion in failing to consider the town’s significant evidence” and asked that the justices consider whether the lower court “improperly substituted its own preference” for the eminent domain proceedings.Aaron Frank, the town manager for Colchester, did not respond to a request for comment. A.J. LaRosa, the attorney for Mongeon Bay Properties, could not be reached.The town has long held an easement on the site to operate and maintain a decades-old stormwater drainpipe and catch basin underneath the property.Town officials claim that seizure of the property is necessary for both environmental and liability reasons. Frank said previously that the town “did not believe this was a sound situation due to the certainty of need for future repairs and replacement of the pipe.”“Having a seasonal rental property on the side of a steep slope, and on top of a large stormwater pipe presents a significant financial burden to the town and its taxpayers,” he added.In late 2021, the town queued up plans to build a treatment facility on the property that would remove phosphorus and other contaminants from stormwater before discharging it into Malletts Bay. The property owner sued the town in 2022.In his decision, Hoar suggested that the condemnation attempt stemmed from a previous lawsuit, when the town and property owner clashed in court over repairs to the town-owned stormwater drainpipe, which ruptured following an October 2019 storm.The two parties eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount of money. But the town initiated the condemnation proceedings while that court case was underway, Hoar wrote in his decision.The judge wrote in the ruling that a town attorney had threatened the property owner in 2020, saying, “if you sue the town we will take your house by eminent domain.”The Supreme Court has yet to schedule a date to hear the town’s appeal.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Colchester appeals eminent domain lawsuit to state Supreme Court.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/east-lakeshore-1-20250326-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-19 19:04:58.105776

An official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service on May 6 wrote a letter to all U.S. states asking them to provide the “names, dates of birth, personal addresses used, and Social Security numbers” of anyone who is receiving or has applied to receive benefits under the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP).
Fidelity Information Services, the private contractor who processes payments on behalf of New Mexico’s Health Care Authority, informed the agency that it had received a formal request from USDA for “records regarding SNAP cardholder and transaction data,” Marina Pina, spokesperson for the HCA, told Source NM on Monday.
HCA told the contractor that it does not consent to disclosing the information, “due to questions and concerns regarding the legality of USDA’s demand for the information,” and FIS agreed not to provide it, Pina said in an emailed statement.
“USDA also acknowledged that its request contained many vague or ambiguous terms and will be providing additional guidance in the relatively near future,” Pina said. “HCA will assess how to proceed after receiving that additional information from USDA.”
The USDA’s May 6 letter cites President Donald Trump’s executive order which directed federal officials to ensure the U.S. government “has unfettered access to comprehensive data from all State programs that receive Federal funding.”
States Newsroom reports that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Trump’s billionaire advisor Elon Musk, has alarmed data privacy experts by accessing sensitive information from the Treasury Department payment system, information about the headcount and budget of an intelligence agency and Americans’ Social Security numbers, health information and other demographic data.
A spokesperson for USDA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the data request or the additional guidance.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation is heading up an inquiry into two inmate deaths that occurred last week on the campus of the South Dakota State Penitentiary.
The deaths, as well as a host of security breakdowns in recent months, are among the motivating factors for a planned Friday protest outside the facility in Sioux Falls.
DCI spokesman Tony Mangan confirmed Monday that the agency is working with the Department of Corrections’ Office of Internal Affairs to look into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of two men housed in Sioux Falls.
The first, 39-year-old Jason Garreau, was found unresponsive in his cell on May 15, according to a news release sent by the DOC the following day. 
Fight breaks out at penitentiary one month after similar violence that injured officer

A similar news release came two days later, on Sunday, and also used the verbiage “found unresponsive in his cell,” in reference to the death of 24-year-old Joshua Arrow.
Garreau lived in the penitentiary, an 1881 structure whose age, safety and crowded conditions have caused three years of discussion among state lawmakers on a replacement. 
Arrow lived in the Jameson Annex, a building erected in the 1990s to house maximum-security inmates, those in disciplinary segregation and those with mental health needs. 
Both facilities have seen outbursts of violence since March. There were two incidents just days before a work group studying prison construction walked through for a visit in early April. The first involved a female correctional officer assaulted at the penitentiary, the second an outbreak of violence between multiple inmates at Jameson that led to injuries and a facility lockdown.
The penitentiary once again saw a flare-up of fighting in early May. On that violence, the DOC only offered that there were no “life-threatening” injuries or injuries to officers.
On May 7, a correctional officer was assaulted at Mike Durfee State Prison in Springfield, a medium security prison that played host to two days of wide-scale fighting last summer. 
After a tour of Southeast Technical College in Sioux Falls on May 7, South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said he has “full confidence” in Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko to manage the security issues within the DOC. 
Wasko, he said, has “done a pretty good job of managing that situation, given the circumstances that she’s inherited and the conditions and the overcrowding.”
On Friday, a group led by a former inmate named Tracii Barse plans to protest conditions at the penitentiary from 4 to 6 p.m. in Sioux Falls. The poster for the event says the group intends to “peacefully and respectfully” protest “the treatment the inmates are enduring from admins and guards.”
“We will be speaking in honor and memory of the deaths that have recently happened inside the prison system,” the poster reads.
Barse said one of the primary goals is to push the DOC to respond to the concerns of family members with more honesty and transparency. While lawmakers discuss the possibility of expensive new prison construction projects, Barse said, inmates are injured, sick and dying, and family members – and the public – are left to wonder about the circumstances for days, weeks or longer.
“The people have the right to know what’s going on,” Barse said.
Nicole Gednalske, a spokeswoman for the DOC, told South Dakota Searchlight in an emailed statement that the agency is “awaiting autopsy results at this time” on the two recent deaths.

Kelly Armstrong on May 3, 2025, after lawmakers adjourned. (Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Gov. Kelly Armstrong issued seven line-item vetoes on six bills Monday, with many objections focused on policies he felt lawmakers “shoehorned” into budget bills or encroached on executive authority.
One line-item veto was of a section of the Ethics Commission’s budget bill meant to protect lawmakers from being prosecuted for conflicts of interest — though he let a similar clause in the bill become law. 
Both provisions, part of Senate Bill 2004, concerned lawmakers who have a special interest in the outcome of legislation. Under House and Senate rules, lawmakers are supposed to notify their peers when they believe they have conflict of interest with a bill so that their colleagues can decide whether to excuse them from voting. They may also seek guidance from the Ethics Commission.
North Dakota lawmakers approve Ethics Commission bill with deadline removed

The vetoed clause stated that if a lawmaker voted on a bill they had a conflict of interest with, but followed legislative ethics rules and/or followed informal guidance from the Ethics Commission, they couldn’t be prosecuted for any potential crime that stemmed from that vote.
In a line-item veto message, Armstrong said the provision “sends the wrong message to North Dakotans.”
“While transparency and ethical conduct are essential in a representative democracy, this provision elevates internal legislative procedure above state law, effectively shielding lawmakers from accountability under our criminal code,” he wrote.
He said the clause would create another blanket protection for lawmakers at a time when the state “already has opaque campaign finance laws.” The Legislature at the last minute rejected a bill some hoped would increase campaign finance disclosure requirements — a move Armstrong criticized.
Armstrong signed the rest of the Ethics Commission budget into law, which included another more narrow immunity clause. The narrower section protects a lawmaker from being prosecuted under a specific statute for voting on a bill they have conflict of interest with if they follow House and Senate ethics rules. The statute, titled “speculating or wagering on official action or information,” is what Rep. Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck, was convicted of last year. 
“Section 4 of Senate Bill 2004 is acceptable and reasonable because it appropriately clarifies that legislators must have the freedom to perform their official duties without fear of prosecution,” Armstrong said in his veto message.
Effort to improve North Dakota campaign finance reporting fails

The Ethics Commission expressed earlier this month that the immunity provision the governor vetoed would have made it legally more risky for the commission to give informal advice.
Other line-item vetoes
House Bill 1003, budget for the attorney general: Armstrong vetoed a provision that sought to prevent a district court judge from waiving fees for the 24/7 sobriety program. “It invites a constitutional challenge and will only increase costs and jail overcrowding for counties,” Armstrong wrote in his veto message. He also noted a standalone bill, Senate Bill 2365, had the same provision but failed in the House, yet the policy was later “logrolled” the budget bill.
Senate Bill 2014, North Dakota Industrial Commission budget: The governor vetoed a $150,000 passthrough grant from the Housing Incentive Fund to a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. “Addressing homelessness and housing insecurity requires a comprehensive, sustainable, and statewide strategy, not isolated, one-time allocations to individual entities,” Armstrong wrote in his veto message.
Also in that bill, Armstrong vetoed a mandate for the Bank of North Dakota to spend up to $250,000 to study economic development strategies in western North Dakota as oil production decreases. The governor said the Department of Commerce already has the authority to do such a study.
House Bill 1019, Parks and Recreation Department budget: Armstrong vetoed a portion of the bill that sought to eliminate the department’s ability to rename state parks and require legislative approval for name changes. Armstrong wrote that provision encroaches on the executive branch. It also could complicate matters if federal dollars were contingent on the renaming of a state park, he said. Last November, the department changed the name of the state park in Medora to Rough Rider State Park.
Senate Bill 2001, Legislative Council budget: Armstrong vetoed a line in the budget that reserves the 15th floor of the Capitol for legislative staff. The floor is occupied now by the Department of Career and Technical Education. Armstrong said lawmakers did not get input from his administration, the department affected or the public. He said his administration will help identify available Capitol space, but he objected to doing so in state law.
Senate Bill 2018, Department of Commerce budget: Armstrong vetoed $350,000 to the State Fair Association for sanitation restoration projects. The governor said that funding should have been included in the State Fair Association’s primary budget. He said adding it to the Commerce budget at the end of the session “is a clear example of logrolling, which undermines transparency, accountability, and the principle of deliberate budgeting.”
“Through limited use of my line-item veto authority, we’ve reduced spending, protected the integrity of the budgeting process and preserved executive branch authority to ensure that state government remains efficient and transparent,” Armstrong said in a statement Monday.
Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, chair of the Legislative Management Committee, said Monday that while he may disagree with some of the vetoes, he does not believe Armstrong overstepped his authority. 
“I don’t think they (the vetoes) rise to the level of a situation where we’d want to independently call ourselves into session,” Hogue said. “If we had another reason, we might take them up, but these vetoes would not be the impetus in my view.”
The Legislature, which adjourned earlier this month, does not have to act on the vetoes within a set amount of days, said Emily Thompson, director of the legal division of Legislative Council. She added lawmakers would need to use at least one of their six remaining legislative days to consider a potential veto override.
Lawmakers during the 2025 session passed a total of 601 bills. Armstrong signed 597 and vetoed four bills in their entirety: a bill affecting state employee health insurance, a library content bill, a private school voucher bill and a tax credit for prison industries. Budget bills take effect July 1 and policy bills take effect Aug. 1.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa farmers have less than 10% of corn acres left to plant, which puts them a whopping 12 days ahead of last year’s pace and four days ahead of normal, according to the crop progress and condition report. 
The report said farmers made “rapid progress” during the reporting period which had nearly a full week suitable for field work.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the rain and cooler temperatures forecasted this week might mean fewer days in the field, but could be helpful for young crops. 
“We need the moisture across the state, and the widespread rainfall will give the recently planted corn and soybeans a good boost,” Naig said. 
According to the crop report, released weekly by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, some corn struggled to emerge, due to dry conditions in scattered areas across the state, and had to be replanted. 
Overall, 58% of planted corn and 42% of planted soybean acres have emerged. More than 80% of soybean acres across the state have been planted. 
Iowa had an average rainfall of less than a tenth of an inch of rain and a statewide average temperature of 65 degrees, which is 4 degrees above normal. The lack of precipitation and high temperatures caused topsoil moisture conditions to drop from 70% adequate the previous week, to 53% adequate for the reporting period of May 12-18. Subsoil moisture conditions also dropped from 67% adequate to 58% adequate in the latest report. 
More than 60% of Iowa is in abnormally dry conditions, according to the latest report from the U.S. Drought Monitor, which shows western and southern regions are driest. 
Despite the somewhat dry conditions, 63% of pastures rated good or excellent in the state. Hay and oat conditions also rated well for the reporting period with 78% and 86%, respectively, rated good or excellent. 
Precipitation outlooks for the state show 1-2 inches of rain anticipated in the next seven days.

DemasThe United States Environmental Protection Agency on Monday lifted its emergency order on drinking water in the City of Flint, with agency Director Lee Zeldin announcing the city had met all the requirements outlined in the order. 
“EPA has been working closely with our state and local partners in Flint, Michigan for several years to restore safe drinking water. It’s been a long, arduous journey, but significant progress has been made over the last decade to revitalize their water infrastructure and ultimately achieve this goal,” Zeldin said in a video posted to YouTube. 
With water sampling placing the city in compliance with Safe Drinking Water Act Standards, and the city replacing over 97% of its lead pipes carrying water to homes, the end of the order will place the city under the normal obligations of the Act, Zeldin said.
“Our message to the residents of Flint, Michigan is simple. EPA will work with all other levels of Government to do its part to ensure your community has safe drinking water for decades to come. We will continue to be a partner to provide technical assistance to the city and state as efforts continue to maintain and upgrade water infrastructure,” he said. 
The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE, similarly voiced its commitment to ensuring Flint residents have access to safe water. 
“Through the dedicated efforts of the state and our strong partnership with the City of Flint, we’ve made remarkable progress, replacing the vast majority of lead service lines and ensuring Flint’s water meets stringent safety standards. Working with the city to ensure the complete removal of all lead service lines remains a top priority,” EGLE spokesman Scott Dean said in an email. 
The Flint water crisis began in April 2014 when the city of Flint switched its water source from Detroit-supplied Lake Huron water to the Flint River, and failed to treat the water with corrosion control leading to pipes leaching lead into the city’s water alongside other contaminants. 
At least 12 people died as a result of the water crisis, with Genesee County Circuit Court Chief Judge David J. Newblatt eventually giving final approval to a settlement ordering the state to pay $600 million to residents and property owners whose water was contaminated. The city of Flint was also ordered to pay $20 million, McLaren Regional Medical Center was ordered to pay $5 million and Rowe Professional Services was required to pay $1.25 million. 
According to EGLE, Flint has met state and federal lead in drinking water standards for 18 consecutive monitoring periods with the latest round of monitoring noting that samples for the 90th percentile came in at 3 parts per billion below the federal requirement of 15 ppb.
“This moment is about the people of Flint—about their voices, their strength, and their determination,” Flint Mayor Sheldon Neeley said in a statement. “For nearly a decade, we have worked tirelessly to restore trust and integrity to our water system, as well as meeting rigorous standards. While this milestone marks progress, our commitment to clean, safe drinking water remains unwavering. We will continue to advance infrastructure, strengthen safeguards, and ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated. Flint families deserve nothing less.”
However, Flint Water Activist Melissa Mays said the announcement came as a complete shock, telling the Michigan Advance there are still deficiencies in the City’s water system and plenty of lead lines in need of replacement.
While community members planned to gather Tuesday night to celebrate community members who successfully held the City accountable in progressing on its court-ordered lead pipe replacement program, Mays said while a celebratory announcement from the EPA was expected, Monday’s message was not. 
“Did we expect for them to bail before the work is done? No, no, that was a shock,” she said. 
“That being said, looking at what this current administration is doing, yeah, the environment and people’s public health and safety, clean safe water are not priorities. They’re the opposite, apparently,” Mays said. 
While the city still struggles with rupturing water mains and residents continue to face issues with discolored, foul-smelling water, people cannot be expected to trust the infrastructure, Mays said, raising further concerns about where the EPA’s decision leaves Flint and other communities as Congressional Republicans work to repeal updated limits on lead in water.
“It is infuriating that the EPA still hasn’t even settled our civil cases yet, and the civil cases are based on the EPA not acting, not stepping in, not forcing the city and state to do the right thing. And here they’re doing that exact same thing,” Mays said. 
While a federal judge ruled in February that Flint residents’ case against the agency can move forward despite the EPA’s arguments that it should be immune, the agency hasn’t signaled that it’s willing to settle, Mays said.
“That recourse of, ‘hey, if the city messes up, you go to the state. If the state messes up, you go to the federal government.’ We don’t have that anymore. They’re just like, ‘well, you’re on your own, and we’re leaving you with the people responsible for causing the Flint water crisis,’” Mays said.

The state House will vote on its spending plan this week, with  Appropriations and Finance committee meetings Tuesday and possible floor votes to follow Wednesday and Thursday. 
After the House passes its budget, House and Senate negotiators will meet to reconcile their differences, including differences over how to compensate state employees. 
The Senate budget proposal approved last month included 1.25% raises and $3,000 in bonuses spread over two years for most state employees. Law enforcement officers would receive bigger raises under the Senate plan. 
Both the House and Senate budget proposals would eliminate vacant jobs. The House budget says it is using money from eliminating positions to fund employee raises. 
The House budget includes “one time” supplements for retirees of 1% in the first budget year and 2% in the second year. 
The House budget increases starting teacher base pay from $41,000 to $48,000 in 2025-26, and to $50,000 the following year. The House budget would also restore salary supplements for teachers with advanced degrees. 
“The NC House budget delivers some of the largest teacher pay raises in state history – because we’re serious about investing in our classrooms not just talking about it,” Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus) wrote on social media. 
While beginning teacher salaries would rise dramatically, teachers with 25 years experience and more would see 2.1% raises.
Tamika Walker Kelly, president of the NC Association of Educators, said they appreciate the attention to beginning teacher pay, but experienced teachers deserve more.
“We appreciate lawmakers’ recognition of the urgent need to raise starting teacher pay and restore master’s pay to help address the teacher shortage faced by our public schools,” Kelly said in a statement. “Attracting new and highly qualified educators into the profession is essential, but if we want our schools to be the best in the Southeast, we need to do more for veteran teachers, who are the backbone of our public schools.
“A minor 2.1% raise for our most experienced teachers doesn’t send the signal that we value long-time education professionals, despite the scientific evidence that veteran teachers help students learn and grow more, and the reality that new teachers depend on the experience of their colleagues.”
On taxes, the House budget increases the standard deduction by $500 for tax filers who are single and by $1,000 for married people filing jointly.
A tax deduction on tips of up to $5,000 would begin in the 2026 tax year. 
The budget also revives back-to-school sales tax holiday for the first weekend in August starting next year. 
Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are having to budget more carefully this year to deal with the massive rebuilding effort in the western part of the state. Gov. Josh Stein asked state lawmakers Monday to approve an additional $891 million in post-Helene funding, amid concerns that federal aid was slow and uncertain.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_9532-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)In a committee room on the third floor of the Roundhouse on Monday, many Tesuque Village residents hotly contested a luxury resort’s proposal for sewage disposal during the first of five days of scheduled hearings before the state environment department.
Earlier this year, NMED approved a draft permit for Bishop’s Lodge and a nearby development with 82 homes to discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new leach field using a treatment plant installed in 2024.
The state and Bishop’s Lodge’s parent company maintain that the proposal to treat sewage is safe, noting that the new wastewater treatment plant is “designed to meet or exceed all local and national water quality standards.”
The current state permit authorizes Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two leach fields on the property; the inn and surrounding houses have been paying to truck sewage into Santa Fe.
Residents of Tesuque Village, with a population of just around 1,000 people who rely mostly on private wells for drinking, have objected, saying the disposal method threatens to pollute drinking wells downstream. Opposition has become more organized, with community members opposed to the permit creating a nonprofit called Protect Tesuque.
In statements during public comment during the hearing, Bernadette Romero-Jaramillo, a lifelong resident and Protect Tesuque board member, described the permitting process as an example of “environmental injustice.”
“This is what environmental injustice looks like, the people making decisions, the executives, the investors, the state official signing off on these permits — they don’t live here, they don’t rely on well water, their children don’t drink from the aquifers,” Romero-Jaramillo said. “They won’t feel the impact of these choices, but we will, our families will, our children will.”
Residents in opposition were not the only public commenters. Jeffrey Rogers, a homeowner in Tesuque called the opposition to the permit “a lot of hyperbole.”
“This is a wastewater permit, this isn’t a petrochemical factory that’s asking to be buried in our backyard, or something like that,” he said. “It’s had a permit before, it’s carried on with that permit, and now opportunity is there to provide outstanding wastewater treatment that frankly, our community hasn’t had before.”


How to watch:
The New Mexico Environment Department proceedings will continue this week, and links to the live stream are available on the agency’s events calendar.


The state environment department will make a final determination for the permit based on the application, public comments and testimony during the public hearing. Those final determinations can include: approving, conditionally approving or disapproving the draft permit.
In April, Protect Tesuque filed an emergency petition before the New Mexico Supreme Court, requesting the justices to stop the process and require NMED to reissue the permit.
That matter remains  pending before justices. The court requested that other parties file their arguments by the end of the day Monday.

Despite two nominations as an interim topic, lawmakers will not be studying the practice of running over predators — a tactic livestock producers say they need. 
The post Ban on chasing, striking Wyoming’s wildlife with snowmobiles rejected, again, by legislative committee appeared first on WyoFile .","A continued push to end a brutal form of motorized over-snow hunting did not gain traction with Wyoming lawmakers studying bills ahead of the 2026 legislative session, despite a Sublette County incident that shined an unprecedented spotlight on the practice and multiple nominations for a ban. 
The idea of prohibiting the use of snowmobiles to kill fleeing wildlife appeared twice on the list of proposed topics that were considered by the Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee. 
“Such conduct is cruel, unsportsmanlike, and damages Wyoming’s reputation as a responsible manager of wildlife,” stated an idea submitted by Rep. Karlee Provenza, a Laramie Democrat. “A vehicle should never be used as a weapon against wildlife.”
Rep. Mike Schmid, a La Barge Republican who tried twice at a ban during the Legislature’s most recent general session, likewise submitted an idea to study ending the practice of “predator whacking.” Schmid’s proposal — like his failed bill — included a concession to the livestock industry. Specifically, his proposal was for a bill prohibiting the use of vehicles as a weapon to intentionally kill wildlife on public land, so that woolgrowers and cattlemen could continue running over coyotes and other predators on private land to protect their herds — a tactic they say they need.

Recently, in the wake of committee-sponsored bills dying at historically high rates, the Legislature revamped its interim topic selection process. Now there are fewer interim meetings, and committee chairs — not the body’s Management Council — get the final say over what topics to study during the 10 or so months between legislative sessions. Up against two dozen other ideas, Provenza’s and Schmid’s proposals to take a long look at a form of Wyoming recreation that’s been targeted even at the federal level were not selected. 
“That didn’t even come close to rising to the top,” said Rep. Andrew Byron, a Hoback Junction-area Republican who co-chairs the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee with Casper Republican Sen. Bill Landen. “We had our committee members rank their priorities.”

If snowmobiling over wildlife rose into the top 10 prioritized ideas, Byron might have hand-picked the topic for interim study, he told WyoFile. 
“But it was not,” he said. 
There was a Feb. 26 meeting where lawmakers, lobbyists and members of the public pitched interim ideas to the committee. Schmid did not speak in support of his proposal during the gathering. 
Provenza deferred to a co-signer of her idea: Kristin Combs, who directs the Wyoming Wildlife Advocates.
 “Our values in Wyoming are one way, and our laws are another,” she told lawmakers. “I think that it’d be really great for the committee to take a look, a deep dive.”

At the time, Combs praised a bill brought by Byron that stiffened penalties for keeping crippled predators alive — a measure that was a direct response to an infamous February 2024 incident where Daniel resident Cody Roberts brought a juvenile wolf badly injured by a snowmobile into a bar. 
That legislation became law, but it does not criminalize the act of running over animals with snowmobiles — it does, however, specify that animals must be swiftly dispatched after being struck.
A prior, related bill that emerged from a subset of the committee  — the “Treatment of Predators Working Group” — died after language clarifying that it’s in fact legal to run over wolves, coyotes and other predators in Wyoming incited outrage.

Without success, Wyoming lawmakers have been pushing to prohibit recreationally running over animals with snowmobiles for many years. Rep. Mike Yin, a Jackson Democrat, sponsored a bill in 2019, though it did not get as far as a committee hearing. Later that year, Yin tried to convince the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee to take up the topic, but the idea fell flat. 
Six years later, the proposal got the same response — even after the state’s legal embrace of the practice attracted global ire. 
While it’s clear a committee bill will not come out of the interim session, Schmid, Provenza or a coalition of lawmakers could still bring a personal bill during the Legislature’s 2026 session. It will face longer odds of becoming law because it’s a budget year, requiring all non-budget bills to earn two-thirds support for introduction. 
Although recreationally snowmobiling over wildlife is likely to remain part of Wyoming for the foreseeable future, a discussion about its legality is something that needs to happen, Wyoming Wildlife Federation Government Affairs Director Jess Johnson told WyoFile in a text message.

“Statute is one of the ways we as Wyoming present ourselves to the world, and to each other — it is important that the optics match the ethics I know most Wyoming citizens and hunters have,” Johnson said. “We also must be willing to be at the table and listen to our neighbors in agriculture and their needs.”
There’s no clear solution just yet, she added. 
“But something needs to change,” Johnson said, “and we need to do it thoughtfully, creatively, collaboratively and in the spirit of the Wyoming we want to see into the future.”

While several states have imposed bans on noncompete agreements, the Florida Legislature went the opposite way during its recent session and made it easier for employers to impose these agreements on workers.
That’s prompted a coalition of organizations and law professors to ask Gov. Ron DeSantis to veto the measure (HB 1219) — known as the CHOICE Act — when it reaches his desk.
The name stands for Contracts Honoring Opportunity, Investment, Confidentiality, and Economic Growth. The bill would allow an employer to restrict an employee from taking competitive employment for up to four years, through either a “garden-leave” provision or a noncompete agreement.
Any company with employees who are “reasonably expected” to earn more than twice the annual mean wage of the county in which the business is located can subject workers to noncompete agreements. It would also apply to independent contractors and out-of-state employees.
The proposal is strongly opposed by the Economic Innovation Group, which along with more than a dozen law professors sent a letter to the governor last week, calling upon him to veto it.
“The CHOICE Act would codify one of the most anti-innovative, anti-startup, and anti-worker policies to be found anywhere in the country,” said John Lettieri, president and CEO of the organization, in a written statement.
“While dozens of other states are enacting limitations on the use of noncompete agreements, this legislation would take Florida in the opposite direction – locking in talent, stifling wage growth, and undermining efforts to build a cutting-edge ecosystem in the Sunshine State.”
Under the bill, if a company uses a properly drafted noncompete or garden-leave agreement, Florida courts would have to issue preliminary injunctions to stop a former employee from working for a competitor unless the employee can convince the court otherwise.
Employers and employees would need to provide advance notice of up to, but no more than, four years before terminating the employment or contractor relationship.
During a committee stop in the Senate, Jacksonville Democratic Sen. Tracie Davis noted that most noncompete agreements last between one and two years. She asked Northeast Florida GOP Sen. Tom Leek (the bill sponsor) why the state should bind workers for four years.
Leek referenced moves made by the Federal Trade Commission last year to adopt a comprehensive ban on new noncompetes with all workers, including senior executives. A federal judge in Texas overturned the ban in August.
“Florida is poised to become one of the finance capitals of the world,” Leek said at the time. “And if we want to attract those kinds of clean, high-paying jobs, you have to provide those businesses protection on the investment that they’re making and their employees.”
A noncompete lasting for four years would be the longest of any state in the country, according to the Economic Innovation Group.
“There is an abundance of economic research demonstrating that the strict enforcement of noncompete agreements sharply reduces employee wages, the quality and quantity of new patents, and jobs created by new businesses,” the coalition writes in the letter to DeSantis.
“The CHOICE Act would accelerate these economically harmful trends by enacting the following changes to state noncompete law for exactly the type of workers Florida aims to attract to grow its middle class.”
While that alliance is urging the governor to veto the bill, some well-heeled supporters of DeSantis support it. Among those are Citadel, the Miami hedge fund and financial services company, according to Bloomberg.
Citadel is led by Ken Griffin, a well-known GOP megadonor and financial backer to DeSantis who gave $12 million last year to Keep Florida Clean, the political committee formed to oppose the failed constitutional amendment aimed to legalize recreational cannabis for adults 21 and over.

Other coalition members, including Kymara Seals (right) stand behind him. (Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas ballot question committee announced Monday it had submitted a proposed constitutional amendment to protect voters’ right to direct democracy. 
The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment, sponsored by Protect AR Rights, would amend Article 5 Section 1 of the Arkansas Constitution, the section that governs the state’s initiative and referendum process, to designate voters’ right to propose laws and constitutional amendments that can be put to a statewide vote as a “fundamental right.”
This is the second such effort proposed this year in response to state lawmakers approving about a dozen direct democracy-related laws during the 2025 legislative session. Supporters of the new laws have said they will ensure the integrity of the initiative and referendum process, while opponents have argued it will make it more difficult for citizen-led initiatives to qualify for the ballot. 
The direct democracy process allows Arkansans to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allows citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Members of the six organizations that comprise the coalition behind Protect AR Rights gathered inside the Capitol to formally announce their ballot measure Monday. During the press conference, Arkansas Public Policy Panel Executive Director Bill Kopsky said their proposal “strengthens three fundamental citizen rights” in the state Constitution — the right to propose ballot measures, the right to gather signatures on petitions and the right to sign a ballot measure petition.
“Sadly some politicians don’t trust voters…and they’ve stripped the right to the ballot measure process away from us,” Kopsky said. “They are rigging the rules to make it nearly impossible for everyday Arkansans to propose ballot measures to ask their fellow citizens to sign and support measures and to even sign one themselves. We must stand up to this unprecedented power grab.”
Arkansas grassroots organizations seek to intervene in lawsuit challenging direct democracy laws 

The Arkansas Ballot Measure Rights Amendment would make several changes to the state’s initiative and referendum process, including prohibiting the General Assembly from amending or repealing constitutional amendments that voters approved; current law allows lawmakers to do so by a two-thirds majority vote. The proposed measure would only grant that authority for initiated acts.
The measure would also make changes to the signature-gathering process by prohibiting a requirement that signatures be collected from more than 15 counties. A 2023 law, which is being challenged in court, increased the threshold to 50 counties. 
If a qualified voter’s signature is deemed insufficient and therefore will be disqualified and not counted, the proposed measure would require the elector to be notified and given at least 10 business days to correct “any identified insufficiency.” Notification and a minimum cure period of 10 business days would also be required for the sponsors of a measure if there is a filing error.
The proposed constitutional amendment would also require a ballot title challenge to be filed within 10 business days of the title’s approval and be “tried at once with expedited review if appealed.”
Additionally, the measure defines petition fraud and declares it a criminal offense. 
 The other ballot measure

The League of Women Voters of Arkansas is also pursuing its own proposed constitutional amendment aimed at protecting voters’ right to direct democracy. Attorney General Tim Griffin has rejected the measure three times. 
In his most recent rejection earlier this month, Griffin cited a new law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. This was the first time he rejected a proposed ballot measure under Act 602, which became law in April.
Protect AR Rights tried to make its proposal “as readable as possible,” but Kopsky said he doesn’t think it’s possible to meet the eighth-grade reading level and the clarity standard. For that reason, Protect AR Rights last week filed a motion to intervene in a League of Women Voters of Arkansas lawsuit challenging new state laws, he said. 
“We believe we’ll get injunctive relief,” Kopsky said. “If we don’t, we’ll have to rethink our strategy.”

The League of Women Voters of Arkansas’ lawsuit alleges eight recently approved laws governing direct democracy violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Protect AR Rights noted in its motion to intervene that the committee wants to challenge additional laws not included in the lawsuit, including Act 602 of 2025.
Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families is a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition. Executive Director Keesa Smith-Brantley said Monday that the group’s goal is for the proposals from Protect AR Rights and the League of Women Voters of Arkansas to work together.
“We do not want there to be any confusion. We believe that they have critical components,” she said. “There were things that we felt like we needed to equally add to make sure that we enshrine the rights of Arkansans in the Constitution, but we are hopeful to be able to work together in this process and talk about ways that we can make sure that both of the measures that we’re working on get passed.” 
Under state law, the attorney general’s office has 10 business days to approve or reject the proposed ballot measures. The League of Women Voters submitted the latest version of its proposal May 7 and is owed a response from Griffin by Wednesday. The deadline for a response on Protect AR Rights’ measure is June 3.
The attorney general’s office does not have any other pending ballot title proposals, Griffin’s communication’s director Jeff LeMaster confirmed Monday.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/ct-budget-passes-spending-cap-medicaid/,"Lawmakers approved a bill to cover CT's overspending, with Gov. Ned Lamont declaring the first spending cap emergency since 2007.","The General Assembly approved a plan Monday to cover $466 million in state agency overspending — including a $284 million problem in Medicaid — even though it means Connecticut’s budget would exceed the constitutional spending cap for the first time since 2007.
The legislation, which now heads to Gov. Ned Lamont, also helps him and the Democrat-controlled legislature compromise on a new state budget for the next two fiscal years.
The Senate approved the bill 24-10 shortly before 5:45 p.m. The House passed it earlier by a 98-46 tally. Both votes, which followed party lines, provided the 60% vote of approval needed to exceed the spending cap, which limits most budget growth to increases in household income or inflation.
Also included in the bill were provisions that clarify Connecticut’s workers’ compensation law in response to a state Supreme Court decision that would radically increase insurance premiums paid by municipalities and businesses.
“If we did not have a Medicaid deal, we would have been here a very long time,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said shortly before Monday’s debate, referring to a related understanding with the Lamont administration that will make it easier for legislators to fund key programs next fiscal year. “We believe that will help us pay for things like municipal aid [and] special education.”
Maneuvering around the spending cap
Despite the Medicaid challenges, the overall, $26 billion state budget for this fiscal year, which wraps June 30, is headed for the second-largest surplus in Connecticut history.
Analysts project a General Fund operating surplus of $462 million, with surging revenues offsetting hundreds of millions of dollars in anticipated overspending involving more than a dozen state agencies. And a program that forces legislators to save a portion of income and business tax receipts will capture another $1.9 billion.
But the spending cap limit must be followed regardless of the $2.4 billion fiscal cushion that’s projected.
And legislators could not retroactively approve much of that overspending Monday without pushing the current budget about $25 million over the cap.
The alternative, leaders said, would have been to delay Medicaid payments to health clinics, social service agencies and other providers until after the new fiscal year starts on July 1 — a move providers said would have forced layoffs and service suspensions.
The state Constitution allows legislators to exceed the cap legally provided the governor declares a budget emergency in writing and each chamber gives the extra spending a 60% vote of approval.
The spending cap and other budget controls, which last were set in 2017, are largely fixed by law and contract until July 2028, but still can be adjusted with the governor’s consent.
Critics, including some Democrats in the legislature, say the state has overcompensated for its past poor savings habits, stashing cash too aggressively to pay down its hefty pension debt while dangerously weakening education, town aid, health care and other core programs.
Lamont, who told business leaders in mid-January that the spending cap was “sacrosanct,” issued the declaration of a budget emergency early Monday and said he’s not abandoning his budget principles.
“What can you say? ‘It’s a slippery slope. Oh my God, here we go again, just like we did in the early 2000s,’” Lamont said. “I think people know me. That’s not going to happen.”
State officials have legally exceeded the spending cap seven times since it was created in 1991 but not since 2007. That’s when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature, with GOP support, appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But minority Republicans in the House and Senate both chastised the Democratic governor on Monday and predicted the cap overage was the first step in a journey that would end with state budget deficits and tax increases.
“Get your pocketbooks, your wallets ready,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield said during a press conference prior to Monday’s debates. “You’re going to give over more of your money [to] the state of Connecticut.”
Sen. Heather Somers of Groton, ranking GOP senator on the Appropriations Committee, added that “we have a governor who has literally folded like a lawn chair over this.”
Lamont’s communications director, Rob Blanchard, said Senate Republicans “have short-term memory loss,” noting lawmakers from both parties recently voted to order $40 million in additional special education grants for local school districts — despite warnings from Lamont that the current budget was in jeopardy of exceeding the spending cap.
“Nothing about this deficiency proposal will result in a tax increase and will ensure our Medicaid providers can care for our state’s most vulnerable,” Blanchard added.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford noted during Monday’s debate that the latest budget problem could have been avoided had Democrats not ignored projections one year ago that showed Medicaid costs were surging.
Candelora called Monday’s bill a spending cap “end-around that I don’t think I have seen in quite a number of years.”
Medicaid bill opens door for more spending in next budget
Lamont’s declaration, though technically only allowing a spending cap exception this fiscal year, is part of a larger deal that provides some relief down the road as well.
Ritter confirmed Monday that the administration has agreed to carry forward a portion of this fiscal year’s $462 million operating surplus — roughly $255 million to $260 million — into the next, two-year state budget. 
And because those carryforward funds had been appropriated in the 2024-25, they count toward that fiscal year’s spending cap calculation.
In other words, that’s $255 million to $260 million extra that legislators can spend in the coming biennium without pushing the spending cap tally up by one penny.
Democrats and Lamont have struggled to find room under the cap in their plans for next fiscal year to accommodate additional investments in health care, early childhood development, education, and municipal aid.
They also are seeking additional funds to bolster the nursing home industry and services for people with developmental disabilities. The state’s largest health care workers’ union has set a May 27 strike deadline involving about 6,400 caregivers spread across dozens of nursing homes and group homes. The union says its members can earn more serving fast food than caring for Connecticut’s elderly residents and clients with disabilities.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished unless you have a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma could be on the hook for paying almost $500 million if Congress moves forward with historic plans to shift food stamp costs to states.
Jeffrey Cartmell, Gov. Kevin Stitt’s appointee to head the Oklahoma Department of Human Services, discussed the potential impact during his confirmation hearing Monday before the state Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee.
The committee’s chair Sen. Paul Rosino, R-Oklahoma City, asked Cartmell about the potential impact of proposed federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The program provides electronic benefits to purchase certain food items for those who qualify. 
Cartmell said changes to the program formerly known as food stamps could range from $170 million to $450 million a year depending on which cost-sharing plan is adopted by the Republican-led Congress.
He said the U.S. House is considering for the first time requiring states to pay matching dollars on SNAP. He said states could be required to pay up to 25% match.
About 17% of Oklahomans receive food stamps.
Last year, a 10% match would have cost his agency $170 million, he said. A 25% match would cost between $430 million to $450 million, he said.
Congress is also considering altering the administrative portion of the program, requiring the state to pay more, he said. Such a move would cost an additional $30 million to $40 million, Cartmell said.
“Absolute worst case scenario to the agency would be an additional probably $450 million to $475 million that we would no longer have funding for to provide for the program,” he said.
The figures come just days after Stitt and legislative leaders announced a budget agreement that included a 0.25% drop in the state’s top income tax bracket to 4.5% from 4.75%.
The Oklahoma Policy Institute, a Tulsa-based think tank, said the cut would cost the state coffers about $338 million.
Lawmakers recently eliminated the state’s 4.5% state portion on the grocery sales tax.
The panel approved Cartmell’s appointment, which now moves to the full Senate. He would replace Deborah L. Shropshire, who stepped down in the fall.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)GRAND ISLE – Not all jewels have the deep green features of emeralds or sparkle of diamonds. Some tumble from algae-coated cages in a rush of rock and shell, briny water splashing alongside them onto the deck of a boat. 
These fine commodities are oysters, grown and harvested just off Louisiana’s coastline in a different way than the traditional seafloor beds that have been farmed for generations. 
Cultivated in a string of floating cages instead of on the water’s bottom, Grand Isle Jewels, the umbrella brand for all off-bottom oysters in the barrier island community, are marketed as precious gems of the Gulf Coast. 
“You create this craze for a certain item, and everybody’s jumping on it,” said Kirk Curole, owner of Bayside Oysters in Grand Isle.
After retiring from a career in oil and gas, Curole began harvesting off-bottom oysters as a hobby that turned into a small business. He now spends his days on the water, clad in rubber waders and toughened gloves as he pulls his crop from the floating cages.
“It’s the ‘bougie’ oyster. It’s the boutique oyster,” he said. “Everybody wants to try it.”
Louisiana is exploring Grand Isle Jewels as more than just a marketing strategy. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers lists the state’s strong interest in off-bottom oyster cultivation as a way to help build resiliency into an industry under threat from sediment diversions in its final environmental impact statement for the controversial Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project.
Whether this technique can beat back worsening hurricanes, climate change and the impact of sediment diversions is still undetermined.

An industry at risk
On-bottom culture, where oysters attach to reefs or substrate on the water’s bottom, is and has been the most popular method of oyster harvesting in Louisiana’s waters, fed for centuries by the wealth of nutrients carried down the Mississippi River and into the delta region. 
“Oysters here are probably in the best location in this regard because they show very high growth,” said Romain Lavaud, an oyster scientist and researcher at LSU. “They can be harvested within a year, whereas in other parts of their distribution range it can take two to three years.”
But Louisiana’s environment can also be an oyster harvester’s worst enemy. Hurricanes inflict huge damage to oyster reefs, and heavy rains can dilute the salt content of the water, killing oyster crops. 
“You’re kind of, like in any agriculture production, at the mercy of environmental conditions,” Lauvaud said.
Farming oysters has always been a gamble, said Peter Vujnovich, a third-generation on-bottom harvester based in Port Sulphur. Oyster farmers can lose big after a storm, he said. 
“Mostly you try to protect your house, your boats and the equipment and stuff like that, and the rest is really up to God,” Vujnovich said. “Make the sign of the cross, just hope you don’t get a direct hit.”
Port Sulphur saw large losses to its oyster reefs in 2005 from Hurricane Katrina, which eliminated seeding ground for traditional farmers.
Then, there are sediment diversions, a coastal restoration approach that mimics the natural process of building a delta with silty water from the Mississippi River. There are multiple planned diversions in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan to rebuild wetlands that have been diminished through hurricanes, natural subsidence and countless man-made canals. 
The Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project is one of the more controversial ones because of its likelihood of “major, permanent, adverse impacts” to oyster populations, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers environmental impact statement. It would alter or eliminate vast swaths of habitat in the Barataria basin, with the goal of returning the area to what it looked like before the effects of sea level rise, erosion and subsidence changed it.   
But on-bottom harvesters need reefs, and diversions would likely permanently eliminate vast swaths of oyster habitat. The Corps of Engineers’ study for the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion suggests the most productive oyster grounds in its basin, Hackberry Bay, “would experience the highest losses,” potentially experiencing “total loss” of habitat.
Gov. Jeff Landry has called for a pause on the nearly $3 billion project, citing in part its impact on the oyster industry.

Seeding off-bottom solutions
The Corps of Engineers has identified off-bottom oyster cultivation as a potential way for the industry to adapt to the threat of sediment diversions. The federal agency has oversight of all coastal restoration projects and acts as a gatekeeper for what’s proposed in Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan.
Off-bottom farming could “help diversify the oyster industry and add a level of sustainability as the industry adjusts to a changing coast,” specifically in response to the diversion’s impact on salinity, the corps study said. 
Off-bottom culture can help with protection against predators and offer a way to harvest in areas without abundant reefs, left stripped after storms. But the key advantage the Army Corps and the state’s Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority cites centers around mobility. 
Floating cages could, in theory, be moved in response to a low salinity event such as the opening of a diversion. But harvesters need permission from regulators to store their gear and oysters in different bodies of water from where they’re harvested, and that can take up to 18 months to obtain. Also, the Louisiana Department of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not allow oysters to be out of the water for more than 24 hours. 
Mobility could also help mitigate hurricane damage even if the oysters have to be jettisoned so the cages could be moved on shore temporarily during a storm. 
Curole said even if he loses his crop, it’s worth it to save his expensive equipment and harvest off-bottom again after the storm.
“If a storm is coming, I’m just going to go pick up my equipment, even if I have to dump my oysters out,” he said.  “I can oyster next year, or I can oyster in two or three months.”
This works for Curole, whose trailer can haul up to 350 oyster cages, but his business is relatively small. At the scale industry would need, there might not be enough time to relocate all the cages they would use, and the loss could spell doom for a business’ bottom line. 
“It has not been demonstrated that gear can be sunk and retrieved cost-effectively or relocated in time to avoid damage and loss of both gear and crop,” Daniel Petrolia, a University of Mississippi agro-ecomomics professor, wrote in a 2023 report on the economic challenges to off-bottom harvesting in Louisiana.
Time is in short supply as hurricanes approach, especially with storms developing and intensifying more rapidly in recent years. Off-bottom oyster operations are already expensive, according to the Petrolia report. He concludes the loss of harvesting gear to a storm could sink an off-bottom oyster harvester’s livelihood indefinitely.

Reliant on subsidies
Petrolia’s report also found that the success of off-bottom oysters in Louisiana relies entirely on state subsidies.
Louisiana began to offer grants for off-bottom harvesters in 2022, starting with $3 million to address the high startup costs
“Although the … grant program can indeed provide a hand up to existing growers, it does distort market signals and may give the impression that economic conditions are better than they actually are,” the report reads. “The eventual disappearance of the [subsidy] program will likely have consequences.”
The report also doesn’t expect “the average small-scale operation” to be profitable, even with funding support from the state. Curole did not receive a grant from the state and said his business is currently profitable, but he represents a smaller set of growers that operate more for supplemental income. True profitability becomes more possible, according to the report, with larger businesses. 
Off-bottom cultivation was never pitched as a silver bullet solution for the oyster industry’s future. Louisiana SeaGrant, a federal government-LSU partnership, is responsible for the majority of the off-bottom funding and hatchery support. It paid for Petrolia’s report and stands by the idea that off-bottom culture is meant to supplement rather than replace traditional techniques. 
Different off-bottom initiatives continue to support the oyster industry, such as the expansion of hatchery operations that farmers rely on for seed. Further research, such as how to sink and secure cages during hurricanes, and grant money to support it are also needed.
To harvesters like Vujnovich, the survival of the industry doesn’t hinge on a choice between off-bottom or on-bottom cultivation. It’s whether or not these tools will help his industry stand on its own again.
“They’ll always have a few hardcore like me,” he said. “The question is not if it’ll survive; it’s if it’ll flourish again.”

Congress’s proposed changes to Medicaid policies and a state insurer’s potential rate hikes would further stress a system in crisis, the Senator said in a Monday press conference.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Sanders raises alarm on cost of health care in Vermont and nationwide.","Two favorite photos: Senator Bernie Sanders held a press conference alongside Vermont healthcare leaders on May 19 to advocate for programs and policy to make healthcare more affordable in the state. Photo by Olivia Gieger/VTDiggerSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., joined a group of state legislators, health care officials and advocates in Burlington Monday morning to raise the alarm on what they called Vermont’s health care affordability crisis.“Everyone knows that our health care system, nationally and in the state of Vermont, is broken. It is dysfunctional, and it is wildly expensive,” Sanders said. The press conference at Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport was set against the backdrop of Congress’s attempts to push through a mega spending bill that is expected to include work requirements for Medicaid recipients and limit the extent to which state governments can use health care provider taxes to cover their portion of Medicaid funding.Back at home, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont sits in financial jeopardy, having lost $152 million over the past three years. The nonprofit insurer has asked the Green Mountain Care Board to approve double-digit percentage increases to the premiums of plans sold in 2026 on the Vermont Health Connect — the state-run federal Affordable Care Act marketplace. “I’m not sure how anybody is going to be able to afford that,” Sanders said. While he did not touch on the specifics of how the state or federal governments can support the state’s only Vermont-based health insurer and protect it from insolvency, Sanders outlined areas where he thinks further investment can lead to lower health care costs for Vermont in the long term. Those included expansions of primary health care facilities and of nursing education programs that allow the state to rely less on traveling nurses, as well as increased support for home health care and nursing homes. He cited efforts to reduce the cost of prescription drugs as a key area that can lower costs for hospitals, and thus, reduce the costs that get passed onto insurers and individuals.All of this falls under a need for a broader cultural change, Sanders said, from a health care system that is focused on profit to one that supports health care as a human right. READ MORE
“It’s a culture that says (if) we want people to stay in Vermont, we’re going to work day and night to lower the cost of health care, provide health care to all of our people. It’s a different culture,” Sanders said. “We’ve got to radically reorient our priorities.”Lisa Ventriss, co-chair of the newly formed advocacy group Vermont Health Care 911, put a finer point on it at the press conference: She suggested that shifting spending to patient care, rather than to administration or management, would open up “ample room for savings in Vermont,” while curbing the “gobsmacking” premium rate hikes the state has seen.Sen. Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, and Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex Town, who chair the health care committees in their respective chambers, also touted the bills that lawmakers are trying to pass this session to reduce health care costs in Vermont. Namely, the legislators highlighted S.162, which seeks to keep hospital charges in line with Medicare reimbursement rates (called “reference pricing”), and H.482, which would give the Green Mountain Care Board the ability to lower reimbursement rates paid to health care providers by an insurer in danger of insolvency. “We’re saving our Blue Cross and Blue Shield domestic insurer from insolvency. We’re stabilizing access to primary care, family medicine,” Lyons said. “We are now working to allow people to access food, rent and health care without having to make choices for one over the other.”Still, progress at the state level is quickly dwarfed by the potential threat of federal changes to Medicaid. Most worrisome, Black added in an interview following the press conference, is the threats from President Donald Trump’s administration to undo the so-called 1115 waiver program. That waiver gives states the ability to cover services beyond what federal statute outlines as required coverage under Medicaid. Vermont has become a particular leader on finding innovative ways to use this waiver. “It’s a huge amount of our Medicaid spending,” Black said. Sanders said he and Senate Democrats are trying to do “everything that we possibly can, in every possible way, to defeat this awful piece of legislation,” with regard to the spending bill’s impact on Medicaid in Vermont.He called the congressional bill a “Robin Hood proposal in reverse.”“You take from the poor and you give to the very rich. This is a disastrous piece of legislation, we’ve got to defeat,” he explained. The real solution, he suggested, is guaranteed health care for all, but for now he lauded the state’s efforts in “trying to begin to address this crisis.”“What we’re doing today is trying, at least to develop a sense of urgency in the state of Vermont. The status quo cannot continue. It is failing — failing small business. It’s failing patients. It’s failing everyone,” Sanders said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen.

Evans said in a statement Saturday he is considering running for the position and plans to meet with people living in the northwest Iowa district in the coming weeks in order to determine “the best path forward.”
“After thoughtful prayer, conversations with my family, and encouragement from supporters across the district, I’m excited to share that I am officially launching an exploratory committee to consider a run for Congress in Iowa’s Fourth District,” Evans said in the news release.

Evans is serving his first term representing Iowa Senate District 3. He is the Senate Education Committee chair and an assistant majority leader in the chamber. Before his time in the Legislature, Evans worked as a superintendent in multiple Iowa school districts including the Alta-Aurelia Community School District. He currently works as an adjunct professor at Buena Vista University.
Evans said that during his time in the Senate, he has worked to “protect rural values, defend our freedoms, and bring common-sense leadership to tough issues like education, tax relief, and government overreach.”
“Now, I’m exploring how I can serve Iowa on a larger scale — bringing true conservative leadership to Washington and giving rural Iowa a strong, principled voice in Congress,” he said.
Evans’ announcement comes after U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who currently holds the seat, announced his exploratory committee for a gubernatorial run earlier in May. Gov. Kim Reynolds has announced she will not seek reelection in 2026. Feenstra has represented the 4th District, a longtime conservative stronghold in the state, since the 2020 election, when he defeated then-incumbent Rep. Steve King in the Republican primary.
With Feenstra potentially ending his time as the 4th District representative to run for governor, there could be an open Republican primary for the congressional seat.
Democrat Ryan Melton, who has run against Feenstra in previous elections, has also announced his campaign for the 4th District seat, and other Republican candidates could enter the race. Another potential contender, Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, said in a social media post Friday that he does not intend to run for U.S. Congress but will seek to continue serving in the Iowa House.

(Provided by the SC Department of Corrections)COLUMBIA — Attorneys for a condemned inmate are asking for more information about the state’s execution methods before the inmate chooses which one will kill him.
Stephen Stanko, whose execution is scheduled June 13, has until May 30 to choose his method of execution. His attorneys have questioned whether two of the available methods, firing squad and lethal injection, have gone the way officials anticipated and are asking for more information on protocols and previous executions before the 57-year-old inmate must choose between them.
“Stanko now faces selection of a method of execution with serious unanswered questions,” the motion, dated Friday, reads.
Execution scheduled for SC inmate with 2 death sentences

Stanko also has the option of electrocution, but his attorneys have advised him to avoid the electric chair out of belief that it is less humane than either firing squad or lethal injection, “if carried out properly,” according to the motion.
Ahead of Stanko’s decision, state law requires the director for the Department of Corrections to submit a sworn statement to the state Supreme Court certifying which methods are available and that they’ve been recently tested.
Two of the five inmates executed since September objected to the statement ahead of their executions, claiming it was too vague about how the department tests and stores the pentobarbital used for lethal injections. The objections did not change anything. The state’s highest court ruled in both cases that the statement had enough information for inmates to make their decisions.
This is the first time attorneys have requested more information about the firing squad.
The motion comes soon after attorneys raised concerns that the state’s most recent firing squad execution, which took place April 11, didn’t go as planned. A pathologist who attorneys hired to review inmate Mikal Mahdi’s autopsy report found the bullets mostly missed his heart, failing to destroy it completely as they did in a previous execution. And his chest showed two bullet holes when he was supposed to have been hit with three bullets, according to filings submitted to the state’s highest court.
These problems could’ve meant Mahdi was alive and in pain longer than the 10 to 15 seconds experts predicted as the state high court weighed whether the method was constitutional, attorneys wrote. Media witnesses reported that Mahdi was breathing and making sounds for about a minute after the bullets struck him.
“An explanation for why Mahdi was conscious and suffering pain for more than double that time and how it will be avoided in the future is necessary as another inmate faces the gruesome choice between execution methods,” attorneys wrote in their request to the court.
A Department of Corrections spokeswoman said nothing went wrong. Two of the bullets struck Mahdi in the same place in his chest, following the same route through his body, and bullet fragments struck his heart, spokeswoman Chrysti Shain said previously.
2 SC legislators call for independent investigation into latest execution

Friday’s motion from Stanko’s attorneys asks the court to require that agency include in its filing a redacted version of the internal report it conducts after each execution, protocols for how exactly a doctor locates an inmate’s heart to place the target for the firing squad, and more information about the bullet fragments recovered in the two previous firing squad executions.
The attorneys also want to know more about how marksmen are trained and whether the same people were operating the guns in both executions, according to the filing.
“Information about the shooters’ training is especially necessary in South Carolina where there is almost no room for error,” the motion reads. In Utah, the only other state that has carried out executions by firing squad, protocol calls for inmates to be struck with four bullets, attorneys wrote.
More information about the protocol for lethal injection is also needed, attorneys wrote. They questioned, as they have in previous filings, why a doctor seemed to use two doses of deadly pentobarbital spaced 10 minutes apart when the corrections department has said inmates die with one dose.
If that is a backup dose, attorneys asked for clarification on what makes executioners believe it’s necessary. Knowing whether it suggests an inmate is still alive after 10 minutes could help Stanko decide whether he feels lethal injection is his best option, attorneys wrote.
Media witnesses to the state’s three lethal injection executions carried out since September reported that inmates appeared to stop breathing after several minutes and laid still until they were declared dead, usually about 20 minutes after the process began.
Attorneys for the Department of Corrections have not yet filed a response. They have until 3 p.m. Friday to do so, according to a Monday letter from the Supreme Court’s clerk.

The crime that Stanko’s scheduled to be executed for occurred April 8, 2005, though it’s the second of two killings that sent him to death row. He has never claimed innocence. In both cases, his attorneys argued he was legally insane during the killings.
According to prosecutors, Stanko shot his 74-year-old friend, Henry Turner, multiple times while Turner was shaving in the bathroom mirror. Stanko stole Turner’s truck and drove first to Columbia, then to Augusta, Georgia, where he pretended to be a businessman in town for the Masters golf tournament. Police caught him after a woman he stayed with in Georgia recognized his photograph in the paper and called the police, according to court records.
Stanko was also convicted of strangling his girlfriend, Laura Ling, to death while beating and raping her then-15-year-old daughter. That happened the day before he killed Turner.
Stanko slit the daughter’s throat and left her for dead before taking off with Ling’s jewelry and credit cards, but the daughter survived and called the police. Stanko received a separate death sentence in that case, for which his appeals are ongoing.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_0542-1024x681.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

(Alex Cochran for Alabama Reflector)Most of the complaints are handwritten in ballpoint pen and sent from prisons to federal courts through the U.S. mail. The particulars about the incidents vary, but fear of correctional officers is a common theme.
“I am requesting an emergency transfer before these officers kill me,” wrote one man from St. Clair Correctional Facility.
“I am more afraid now than I ever have been since I was first incarcerated,” wrote another man from Holman Prison.



May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and some corrections officers named in lawsuits alleging excessive force have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.

May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


“Don’t let these people kill me,” wrote another man from Donaldson Correctional Facility. “I’m scared for my life and that they will say I killed myself.”
The allegations are from three civil rights lawsuits among 124 that the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) has paid to settle since 2020. The vast majority involved complaints of excessive force inside Alabama’s violent and overcrowded prisons, according to a review of court records and state financial data.
An Alabama Reflector examination found that of 124 lawsuits that ADOC settled in the five-year period between 2020 and 2024, 94 involved complaints of excessive force. Other lawsuits alleged wrongful deaths and accused ADOC staff of failing to protect incarcerated people from violence, including assaults and rapes.
The cost of defending lawsuits against individual officers and larger, class-action cases against the entire department has pushed ADOC’s legal spending over $57 million since 2020. In the last five years, the department has spent over $17 million on the legal defense of accused officers and lawsuit settlements, along with over $39 million litigating a handful of complex cases against ADOC, including a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice over prison conditions.
Data on civil lawsuits and outcomes against other state prison systems is not readily available, but the sheer volume of excessive force cases ADOC is settling is significant, according to several correctional experts.
“That sounds extreme, in my experience,” said Steve Sinclair, who retired as Washington’s Department of Corrections Secretary in 2021 after a 32-year career in corrections. “It’s pretty routine to have lawsuits for various reasons, and not all of those are legit lawsuits. But certainly not 60 or 80 plus. It’s inconceivable to me.”
The 94 excessive force lawsuits were settled between 2020-2024, but resulted from incidents that occurred in the span between 2014-2022, and cover 15 of ADOC’s 26 institutions, including maximum, medium and minimum-security facilities.
Alleged acts of excessive force resulting in serious injury were documented everywhere from the Loxley community work center, a minimum-security facility housing 360 prisoners who work in the community, to death row at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, depicting an institutional landscape characterized by subterranean brutality.
Forty-five percent of the lawsuits detailed injuries so severe that the victims required hospitalization, ranging from lacerations requiring stitches to broken bones, many requiring surgery. Some complaints allege beatings that resulted in multiple injuries. Medical records submitted in court show one man had both arms broken in an incident involving an officer. Another man said he suffered broken ribs and broken bones in his back from a staff assault. A third was hospitalized with a broken leg and hand. Nineteen complaints described traumatic head and brain injuries. At least seven cases detailed catastrophic traumas that left the victims permanently disabled or disfigured.
The findings are the result of a monthslong investigation that included the examination of accounting data obtained from the Alabama Department of Finance detailing all payments made from the General Liability Trust Fund since 2020, as well as court records connected to the trust fund transactions.

The General Liability Trust Fund operates similarly to insurance, with a $1 million cap per incident, to cover both the legal defense of state employees and any potential settlement payment, also known as indemnity, to plaintiffs. State agencies pay an annual premium to participate. The fund is used for individual plaintiff-filed lawsuits that seek damages. Lawsuits filed against entire state agencies, like class-action litigation that seek to change policy, are paid for out of the state’s General Fund.
The increased volume of individual lawsuits filed against employees of ADOC comes as the department is embroiled in several class-action lawsuits against the entire system over prison labor and the lack of mental health treatment, as well as ongoing litigation with the U.S. Department of Justice, which sued the state in December 2020 after concluding that Alabama “failed or refused to correct” unconstitutional prison conditions, including the common use of excessive force.
A staff member from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Alabama’s Northern District said the lawsuit remains ongoing at this time, but would not provide any further details.
ADOC and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office continue to deny that the state’s prison problems amount to systemic constitutional violations, but lawyers for state employees are routinely using public dollars to quietly pay out dozens of lawsuit settlements—the amounts determined in confidential settlement negotiations or mediation, not reported in court filings, and outside stakeholder scrutiny. While settlements are not an admission of liability, these lawsuits were filed over the same conditions that led the DOJ to sue the state: overcrowding, understaffing, inadequate facilities, and “an excessive amount of violence, sexual abuse and prisoner deaths.”
The DOJ began investigating Alabama’s 13 prisons for men in 2016, and in 2019 released the first of two findings letters that detailed why the federal department found reasonable cause that conditions in ADOC violate the Eighth and 14th Amendment rights of prisoners, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment.
“All too often, correctional officers use force in the absence of a physical threat while making no effort to de-escalate tense situations,” the DOJ stated in its findings letter on excessive force. “Such uses of force heighten tensions in already violent and overcrowded prisons. Correctional officers also use force as a form of retribution and for the sole purpose of inflicting pain.”
In response to questions about the surge in excessive force lawsuits and settlements, an ADOC spokesperson pointed to the DOJ.
“Most are piggybacking off the allegations contained in the DOJ findings letters, which ADOC adamantly denies,” wrote ADOC’s spokesperson, Kelly Betts, in an email response.
Betts also wrote that ADOC “does not comment on pending litigation or confidential settlement negotiations and any resulting agreements,” and referred questions about the number of settlements or specific lawsuits to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which began handling most of ADOC’s civil litigation in 2023.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages seeking comment, including a list of submitted questions.
For decades, ADOC had no internal grievance process for people in prison to file complaints over officer abuse or misconduct. Without proper oversight inside the prisons, lawsuits can serve as a backstop for accountability.
Many legal rights and protections for people in prison have been put in place by the courts, and some of those cases started out as complaints from the prisoners themselves. Everything from the right to send and receive mail, to the right to basic medical care are the results of litigation, said one man who has filed lawsuits against ADOC officers in the past and asked to withhold his name out of fear of reprisal.
“There’s really no bottom to how badly a state will treat prisoners without the intervention and oversight of the courts,” he said. “Filing a lawsuit seeking damages is often the only meaningful way to challenge mistreatment in prison.”
 ‘A culture of impunity’

The 94 excessive force complaints that resulted in settlement payments to victims do not represent the total lawsuits filed against ADOC officers, many of which are dismissed by the courts.
“These are probably the most egregious examples of what is really a culture of impunity and violation of people’s rights,” said David Gespass, an attorney who has represented incarcerated people in excessive force cases against ADOC officers.
The complaints detail incidents occurring in various parts of the prisons — open dormitories and individual cells, but also prison barbershops, chow halls, health care units and bathrooms. Forty-five percent of complainants said officers beat them while they were handcuffed, and 27% alleged the excessive use of chemical spray, two factors cited in the DOJ’s findings.
The state’s highest security and most overcrowded prisons generated the most lawsuits in the time period examined. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer topped the list with 25 excessive force lawsuits ending in settlement, followed by Holman, St. Clair, Limestone and Bibb.
Some of the complaints include shocking and gruesome details.

2018 assault at Ventress. The complaint stated an officer handcuffed the victim behind his back, then struck him from behind, “breaking his jaw in two places, sending a large portion of his jawbone between his teeth and spraying blood all over the wall.” ADOC settled the lawsuit for $90,000, and according to court documents, terminated the officer who assaulted the man.
2019 incident at Limestone. The complaint stated an officer placed the victim in a takedown position, known to cause “excruciating pain” in the shoulders, then another officer kicked his legs, causing him to fall and strike his head on the floor. Officers then sprayed him with mace, kicked and punched him. The man suffered a traumatic brain injury, permanent hearing loss, and numerous contusions, according to the complaint. The plaintiff was released from prison and died of an overdose in 2023, according to court documents. ADOC settled the lawsuit with his mother for $9,000.
2018 assault at Staton. The complaint stated that two officers sprayed the victim with pepper spray, beat him with batons, kicked and stomped him. The man was flown to a hospital in critical condition, where he was diagnosed with bleeding in the brain, multiple fractures to his ribs, face, head, back and damage to his lungs. The man is now in a long-term VA hospital “bedridden, unable to verbally communicate, and minimally conscious.” ADOC settled the lawsuit filed by his family for $55,000.

Five settlements stemmed from a raid at Holman prison in 2016 by ADOC’s “Correctional Emergency Response Team” or CERT. According to the complaints, CERT members charged into the dorm while the men inside were sleeping, shouting and beating men with batons. At least one man was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. The settlements totaled $13,500.
Two years later, another incident involving CERT at Holman led to an excessive force lawsuit filed by a man who uses a wheelchair. The man handwrote in his complaint that one officer slapped him, another hit him in the head with his baton.
“That blow busted my head and caused me to fall out of my wheelchair flat on the floor face down,” he wrote.
“They kicked and stomped on me so viciously until I defecated on myself. I was knocked out unconscious.” His lawsuit ended in a $7,000 settlement.
 Prisoners injured during a medical event

At least a half dozen complaints alleged that officers used excessive force on incarcerated men who were in need of mental health or medical attention, including two filed by men who said they were beaten while having a seizure.
One such complaint accused officers at Bibb of beating a man with batons while he was suffering an epileptic seizure in the infirmary, “strapped or handcuffed into a gurney.” When his seizure was over and the beating stopped, officers accused the man of using drugs, which he denied, according to the complaint. They then “chained plaintiff to a wall as he continued to bleed and exhibit clear epileptic symptoms.”
The incarcerated man presented witness statements from other prisoners and prison staff to support his claim, but officers argued their use of force was justified because the plaintiff was violent and unrestrained.
A federal judge denied the officers’ motions to dismiss the case.
“The court finds that a reasonable jury would have difficulty not concluding that prison officers beating a fully restrained, possibly unconscious prisoner who had just suffered an epileptic seizure ‘offends contemporary standards of decency,’” U.S. District Judge Karen Owen Bowdre wrote.
ADOC settled the lawsuit for $30,000.

“Excessive force should always be treated like a big deal,” said former Washington Department of Corrections Secretary Steve Sinclair. “If you tolerate or minimize it, that’s what builds a horrible culture. And you shouldn’t have to wait for a court to tell you.”
 Mounting cases, mounting costs

A spike in lawsuits filed against individual officers began in 2020. In the five years before that, ADOC typically filed fewer than 20 claims per year to the General Liability Trust Fund, according to records provided by the Department of Finance. In 2020, the number of claims ticked up to 33, then 58 in 2021. In 2022, facing a surge of lawsuits against officers, ADOC filed 194 liability claims, and then filed 235 in 2023. Complete data for 2024 is not yet available.

 
That flood of lawsuits caused ADOC’s spending from the general liability trust fund to quadruple. Between 2015 and 2019, ADOC accounted for $2.9 million in legal expenses and settlement payments from the fund. In the following five years between 2020 and 2024, ADOC utilized $17.4 million from the General Liability Trust Fund, more than any other state department.
Legal expenses for the defense of officers named in the lawsuits amounted to double the amount of paid settlements. Between 2020 and 2024, payments to private attorneys who were hired to represent ADOC employees topped $12.9 million in that five year period, while indemnity, or settlement payments to plaintiffs, accounted for just $4.4 million. Plaintiffs alleging excessive force received a total of $1.7 million, with a median settlement of just $8,000.
These figures represent only a fraction of ADOC’s overall legal spending since 2020. Legal payments to outside attorneys and law firms for the department’s defense in class action cases amount to over $39.7 million, paid out of the state’s General Fund budget, according to records available in the Open Alabama checkbook database maintained by the Department of Finance. Combined with transactions from the state’s liability trust fund, ADOC has spent over $57 million on legal services since 2020. By comparison, the Alabama Attorney General Office’s General Fund budget this year is about $13.7 million.
“I think it’s fair to ask, how much is too much?” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a member of the state’s Joint Prison Oversight Committee and a frequent critic of prison conditions and ADOC spending. “It’s hard to imagine that we were intending to create a fund that just allows us to be in a perpetual state of lawsuits forever. When does the state of Alabama start demanding results from these lawsuits?”

				How we reported “Blood Money”
When state employees are sued as individuals, Alabama’s General Liability Trust Fund is used to pay for their legal defense and any monetary settlement for the plaintiff. This use of the fund was the subject of our reporting, and records helped us identify 124 lawsuits against Alabama Department of Corrections employees that resulted in settlements between 2020 and 2024.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The state’s mental health agency faces billing errors, fraud and information technology vulnerabilities in delivering services, an initial financial examination found. 
Over the next 18 months, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services must implement dozens of changes to protect its patients and billing integrity, the review said.
The agency must also prioritize hiring a chief financial officer and internal auditor with deep public sector experience, according to the initial findings released by David Greenwell.
Greenwell, a certified public accountant, was retained by Gov. Kevin Stitt to oversee the department’s finances and examine the reasons for the financial disarray plaguing the agency that has resulted in contracts being cut or canceled and concerns that the agency can’t afford to pay 2,000 employees.
Greenwell’s findings also show that the agency now needs nearly $30 million in emergency funding from the Legislature to pay its bills. That’s about $2.6 million more than had been previously projected last week by Greenwell and Aaron Morris, state’s chief financial officer. 
In the report first released Monday by Stitt, Greenwell wrote Thursday that he’d reached his latest estimate by examining the agency’s actual expenditures and revenues through May 11, and his number “reflects a best-effort projection” using historical data and trend analysis.
But he said he’s also made 52 recommendations that the agency must take to mitigate risks. Key priorities include updating the agency’s ethical code, adopting modern accounting systems and standardizing reimbursement processes.
“These changes will improve patient care by ensuring funds are used effectively, aligning with Oklahoma’s mental health priorities,” Greenwell wrote.
He said the agency must strengthen its internal controls over financial reporting. 
His recommendations anticipate “improving accuracy, compliance, and accountability in managing mental health services across state-owned and private facilities.” Implementation should be phased in over 18 months with some goals quickly achievable, including enhanced training to create a culture of ethical conduct and accountability, he said.
Greenwell said in a statement that nothing about the mental health department “is permanently broken,” and by making “intentional adjustments to procedures,” the agency will get back to business.
Stitt said that the report “is the signal for a new beginning for the department.”
“No one signs up for a job like this thinking they’ll have to take on decades of financial mismanagement. Commissioner (Allie) Friesen has navigated this challenge admirably and has kept me and my team informed every step of the way,” he said in a statement. “Oklahomans will be better off now that we have a handle on this department.”

Raymond Crews. (LAI photo)Louisiana high school students might soon be able to take a conservative alternative to the ACT exam to qualify for the state’s popular college scholarship program.
State lawmakers quietly approved an amendment to a bill Monday that would make results from the Classical Learning Test acceptable to qualify for the Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, which provides tuition assistance for qualifying Louisiana students. 
Conservative educators are the chief proponents of the Classical Learning Test, which evaluates students on math, writing and grammar with an emphasis on classic literature and historic documents. Its supporters frequently tout that the exam emphasizes texts that “shaped Western culture.” 
The test has been embraced by conservative lawmakers in Oklahoma, Florida and Arkansas. and has the support of the conservative Cato Institution and Heritage Foundation. 
Oklahoma lawmakers extensively debated embracing the test to qualify for their version of TOPS, with Democrats arguing it doesn’t meet the same academic rigor and anti-cheating measures as the ACT. 
In Louisiana, only Louisiana Christian University and the University of New Orleans Honors College accept the test for admissions, according to the CLT website. 
The change to TOPS acceptance standard was made through an amendment to House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, which creates a new level of TOPS awards for high-achieving students. There was no debate on the amendment and it passed without objection. The House approved Turner’s bill in a 91-4 vote. 
Rep. Raymond Crews, R-Bossier City, sponsored the amendment. Crews said Jeremy Tate, founder and CEO of Classical Learning Initiatives, which created and administers the test, asked him to do so. 
Crews said he had not heard of the Classical Learning Test before Tate brought it to him, and he did not know that Tate was associated with the test. 
Turner’s bill was also amended on the House floor to allow students who leave the state for their undergraduate education to use their TOPS awards if they return to Louisiana to attend medical school.

(Courtesy of the Utah House) Rainbow refractions — cascading through a collection of crystals embedded at the peak of the dome above — danced across Dana Jones’ face as she showed off a one-of-a-kind work of art meant to make the Utah Capitol’s newest building something special. 
“We had a vision that we wanted Utahns to connect with this building in a way that if they were going to go on a road trip through Utah, they would be able to see the different landscapes (and its) symbols,” said Jones, executive director of Utah Capitol Preservation Board. 
A group of Utah reporters from various outlets, including Utah News Dispatch, were invited to the Utah Capitol on Monday for the public’s first look at the stained glass dome that’s been installed atop the new building that’s currently under construction to replace what was once known as the State Office Building at the Utah Capitol’s complex in Salt Lake City.

The dome will act as a laylight for the north building’s atrium — and Jones lauded it as one of at least several special works of art state officials will unveil as the north building nears completion. She said it’s expected to be done by the beginning of next year, in time for the Utah Legislature’s 2026 session in January. 
To capture a behind-the-scenes and up-close look at the stained glass masterpiece, reporters were invited to step atop scaffolding more than 200 feet in the air. As construction finishes, the scaffolding will be dismantled — and to most, the dome will only be viewable from hundreds of feet below. But Jones said state officials wanted to show off its vivid colors, textures, hidden symbols and intricate details before the platform came down. 
Glowing with sunlight, hues of blue, red, orange, yellow, green and every color in between poured through its glass. The 25-foot by 25-foot dome featured 89 panels of stained glass made up of 14,000 individual glass pieces. 
Its panes contain at least 34 depictions of Utah landmarks and symbols — some easier to spot than others. 
A flaming orange Rainbow Bridge arches over a seagull, Utah’s state bird. Honeybees (the official state insect) buzz around blooming sego lilies (the state flower). The Colorado River flows through Bryce Canyon and Goblin Valley, two of several Utah state parks featured in the mural.

You may have to squint, but hidden in the stained glass lead lines are symbols including a Utahraptor skull, a cougar, a dragonfly, a hummingbird, a lizard, a hopi kokopelli and anasazi symbol of the sun deity, and even an outline of the Great Salt Lake. 
The stained glass mural was designed by lead artist Dallin Orr at the Lehi-based stained glass studio Holdman Studios, selected through a competitive bidding process. Orr told reporters his goal was to capture “harmony” by balancing all of Utah’s “chaotic and diverse biomes,” from the snowy mountain peaks to the deserts — all anchored around the dome’s center point, the sun. 
Karen Ferguson, the building’s architect, said the dome’s shape — its double curve, transitioning from a square frame to a circle that rounds into a dome — makes it unique. 
Her favorite part? The bristlecone pine — made with sand collected from all of Utah’s 29 counties. 
“That has every county in the state, right there,” she said. “And it’s just so iconic of Utah.” 
Before walking reporters up to the top of the building to see the dome, Jones said the project has been “near and dear to my heart,” and that she hopes others will experience a “wow moment” like she did when she first saw it. 
“We want this to connect with Utah,” she said, adding that the stained glass artwork is special because it’s now “part of the historic fabric” of the Utah Capitol complex. “That is pretty special. We have built this to be long lasting, with the 100-plus year context of this building.” 
Jones said when she first saw the completed dome, “it legitimately took my breath away.” 
“At the risk of sounding cheesy, it was an emotional thing for me,” she said. “When you pour your heart and everything into a project. … I mean, this is part of history.”

Jones said for her, the elk seen trudging through the snow from behind a pine tree evoked memories of her dad — who she said died in the ’90s while elk hunting after he suffered from a heart attack. “He died doing what he loved,” she said. 
Like her, Jones said she hopes Utahns looking up at the mural will find something special they can “connect” with “in their own way.” 
The dome cost $1.6 million to complete, according to Jones — a price tag that she said was well worth it to create an iconic piece of art that will become “the historic fabric of this building.”
“It deserves to have the presence that it has,” she said. “Especially when it represents all things Utah.”

(Katie McKellar / Utah News Dispatch)
The dome is just one piece of a larger construction project that’s been underway at the Utah Capitol complex since 2022. At its groundbreaking, state officials estimated the building would cost about $165 million, but since then its price tag has hit about $208 million, with state officials blaming construction inflation for the price increases, the Deseret News reported. 
When combined with another $73 million for renovations to the Utah Capitol complex’s central plaza fountain and an underground parking structure for lawmakers and state employees, the entire construction project has totaled about $281 million, according to state officials. 
The new north building will replace the old State Office Building, which was built in the 1960s. For years, state leaders had eyed replacing the building, which was not only aging and in need of upgrades, but didn’t fit with the rest of the Utah Capitol complex. 
Now, the new north building will not only match the white stone and marble styling of the rest of the Utah Capitol’s buildings, but it will be more than just an office space for state employees. It will also be the new home for the “Museum of Utah,” as well as offer conference rooms, and other spaces for the public. 
The entire construction project, along with redoing the outdoor plaza and the underground parking lot, is all meant to create more space and help better connect Utahns with their Capitol. 
“We’re doing all this,” Jones said, “to make coming to the people’s house easier.”

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

With the brief window for fiddlehead foraging nearing its close, citizens of the Mi’kmaq Nation hope to collect the traditional food source this week from the Aroostook River flood plain to test as part of their research into understanding, and in turn reducing, forever chemicals in the food supply.
However, they may no longer be able to afford to do the testing they’d planned. 
Following months of preparation after securing federal funding in September, the team received an email from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Mission Support on May 13 stating that their four-year grant had been terminated, effective immediately. 
“The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities,” the email read. 
The EPA terminated all of the ten grants it had awarded for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in plants and animals, including two others to Maine-based teams led by the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the University of Maine. PFAS have been linked to long term adverse health outcomes, such as cancers and weakened immune systems, and their pervasiveness in agriculture is not fully understood. 
The termination of these grants, each for roughly $1.6 million, are some of the latest examples of the billions of federal dollars the Trump administration has blocked despite already being appropriated by U.S. Congress. 
“It’s complete overreach,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “We’re going to appeal. We’re also seeking legal aid.”
Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, UMaine awarded federal grants for forever chemical research

The Passamaquoddy Tribe also plans to appeal the termination of its grant, said Marvin Cling, environmental director for the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point. UMaine did not provide comment regarding whether they intend to dispute the decision by the time of publication. 
The grantees have 30 days from their termination notices to make the case that their work is in compliance with the EPA’s priorities. But crafting that argument is complicated by the fact that the EPA has given contradictory statements regarding why the grants were terminated and whether or not they are in line with the agency’s priorities. 
Conflicting agency response
In a statement provided to Maine Morning Star in response to a request as to why the research no longer aligns with priorities, the EPA equated the grants with Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures. 
“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”
There is no mention of DEI or environmental justice in the Maine teams’ research plans or overall objectives of the grant program.
“This is a matter of public health,” said Frey Corey, information technology director for the Mi’kmaq Nation who is a researcher for the Tribes’ grant. Corey has worked with the EPA since 1996 when he started managing natural resources for the Tribe. 
“There’s been funding challenges over the years — there’s no doubt about that,” Corey said. “But in terms of how they’re operating, this is really unusual.”

Democratic U.S. Rep Chellie Pingree of Maine, who helped secure that funding as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, told Maine Morning Star this response from the EPA was “not only incredibly disappointing, it’s absurd.” 
“To suggest that supporting tribal health and environmental safety — in this case, by studying PFAS contamination in their ancestral waters — is some kind of ‘radical agenda’ is both offensive and deeply ignorant,” Pingree said. “How many times do we have to make clear to this administration that tribes are not ‘DEI’?”
The response the EPA provided to Maine Morning Star runs counter to the agency’s press releases in recent weeks, which highlight a focus on combating PFAS contamination, including through partnerships with tribes. It is also directly at odds with the response EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin gave to Pingree about the grant terminations during an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on Thursday. 
After Zeldin outlined that addressing PFAS contamination is a priority for the agency and him personally, Pingree asked, “Since these grants are consistent with the EPA priorities, do you know why they were terminated?” 
Zeldin responded, “It’s an important program. It’s something that’s congressionally appropriated. The agency’s going through a reorg, so the way that the program and these grants are administered are going to be different going forward.”
In early May, the agency announced a significant reorganization with major cuts to staffing, especially to its Office of Research and Development, the part of the agency that provides scientific analysis on environmental hazards. Pingree has called those changes a blatant abuse of public health and the agency’s core mission. 
Pingree told Maine Morning Star that she felt Zeldin’s response on Thursday was a non-answer.
“The only good thing was he did emphasize that he understood it was appropriated funds,” Pingree said. 










Either Administrator Zeldin was disingenuous with me and our subcommittee, or he and his agency aren’t on the same page.


– U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree


But in light of the EPA’s response to Maine Morning Star, Pingree added, “Either Administrator Zeldin was disingenuous with me and our subcommittee, or he and his agency aren’t on the same page.” 
Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, also told Maine Morning Star she reached out to the agency last week about the grant terminations and is continuing to press leadership to get a clear answer about their status. 
“Research into PFAS mitigation is critically important for our farmers and rural communities, work I am urging the EPA to continue without delay,” Collins said in a statement. “Terminating PFAS grants would be an extremely damaging development.”
Regardless of the reason, Pingree said she considers the termination to be illegal and unconstitutional. 
She is encouraging the grantees to go through the appeals process but said she will continue to question EPA leadership on the terminations, including during hearings for the proposed budget, which outlines a 55% funding cut to the EPA that would directly impact the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. 
Maine has spearheaded efforts to address PFAS contamination. It was the first state to require manufacturers to report intentionally added PFAS in their products and has established a host of assistance programs to help farms continue to operate while also protecting public health.
“It’s just doubly cruel of the EPA to take that money back from Maine when we’ve been such a leader in dealing with this critical toxin in our environment that we have so much more work to do on,” Pingree said.
The research 
The research these grants were supporting in Maine showed promise for helping farmers, communities and consumers detect and prevent PFAS from accumulating in their food, water and soil. It also represents a new model that centers Indigenous communities who have deep knowledge of the land on which this work is being conducted. 
The collaboration between the Mi’kmaq Nation, University of Virginia, Upland Grassroots and Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station dates back to 2019, when they came together to test ways to clean toxins from the former Loring Airforce Base in Aroostook County, which now belongs to the Mi’kmaq Nation.

The team has seen early success with using hemp plants to remove PFAS from soil — a process called phytoremediation. These are the findings that led the group to apply for the EPA grant to further study how this method and others can help reduce contamination from irrigation on farms, a well-known reality for Aroostook County.
After receiving the grant in September, the team began the initial phase of the research, which has three overarching focuses.
Randy Martin, executive director of the Central Aroostook County Soil and Water Conservation District, planned to study how irrigation from the Aroostook River causes PFAS build up in soil and then ultimately in crops. Martin started this winter monitoring contamination levels, watering plants using the Aroostook River and harvesting them for testing. 
The Mi’kmaq Nation is focused on how widespread PFAS contamination is in the ecosystem, including medicinal and culturally relevant plants, such as fiddleheads as well as ash wood, which the Tribe has long used for basketweaving.  
With the grant now in limbo, the team is planning to freeze these samples with the hope that they can still be studied in the future, as testing makes up the bulk of the cost. 
Researchers at the University of Virginia created biosensors to detect PFAS, a twist on the idea of sentinel plants, which are alternative species that display visible symptoms of infection to provide warning signs. Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at UVA, said the grant was going to help expand testing to the field. 
“Our work is directly focused on delivering solutions to farmers and communities affected, which we did and continue to do now,” Berger said. “It also provides crucial data for regulatory decisions, and offers industries a cost-effective compliance tool — ultimately safeguarding public health while reducing environmental remediation costs across all sectors.”
Before the EPA terminated the grant, the team published a paper demonstrating how one application of this technology could be used in monitoring environmental water quality and a report for growers that shows how PFAS accumulates in potatoes grown in northern Maine.
“We’re proud of how much we accomplished in a short time, and frustrated we weren’t given the chance to complete our work,” Berger said. 
Berger, Stanley and Corey said the team is committed to continuing its research despite the grant termination. If it is not eventually reinstated, they plan to explore private funds. 
The other two Maine-based projects had similar but distinct aims. 
UMaine’s project was to examine ways to disrupt the PFAS contamination cycle, including by limiting the chemical uptake by forages (plants eaten by livestock), livestock, and animal byproducts such as milk, meat and manure. The EPA terminated UMaine’s grant on May 10, according to its website.
The Passamaquoddy Tribe, specifically the Sipayik Environmental Department at Pleasant Point, planned to assess PFAS in water and fish from watersheds in Tribal and disadvantaged regions of Northeastern Maine to inform the health of those in the area who depend on recreational fisheries as food sources. The Tribe had been in the process of hiring someone to do the research when it received notice of its grant termination on May 12, Cling said.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)On his first day, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson angered many Democratic lawmakers by demanding the Legislature put $100 million in the next state budget to help local police departments hire police officers.
“That idea was a cornerstone of my campaign for Governor. Any budget I sign must include this funding,” he said in his Jan. 15 inaugural address.
On Monday, there were clear signs of a rapprochement as Ferguson signed House Bill 2015 that embeds a $100 million grant program in a broad policy bill designed to let local and tribal governments decide how best to use those dollars – even if that means not hiring a single new cop.
“It’s a wonderful bill,” Ferguson said, celebrating the political win flanked by Democratic legislators, uniformed officers, and local government leaders. He insisted it will improve public safety and result in more officers on streets across Washington.
“It’s going to be a big step forward. I have no doubt about that,” he said. “Jurisdictions will make their choices, but there’s going to be significant investments in new law enforcement officers. I don’t think there’s any other way to interpret what we did here today.”
The measure signed Monday aims to strike a balance by allowing for spending on more than just police hiring, which many Democrats view skeptically as the best path to improve public safety. 
It allows use of grants to hire and retain not only officers but also peer counselors and behavioral health personnel “working in co-response to increase community policing and public safety.” Crisis intervention training and other areas, like emergency management planning and community assistance programs, are among the additional spending options.
“This is a good law. Public safety is about the community. This bill is from the community, for the community,” said Rep. Debra Entenman, D-Kent, the bill’s prime sponsor. “I want police in communities. I want good and fair policing.”
Bumpy road
Democrats hold near super majorities in the House and Senate. Many of them winced when Ferguson drew a line in the legislative sand in his first speech and winced again when he endorsed the approach in a bill sponsored by Sen. Jeff Holy, R-Cheney.
It remained a sore point all session long as the legislation evolved through many iterations.
On April 15, the Members of Color Caucus in the Senate restated their opposition in a letter to Ferguson.
“While we understand your administration intends to move forward with this law enforcement funding request, we ask that you also commit — equally and unequivocally — to meeting the long-neglected needs that disproportionately affect communities of color,” reads the letter signed by a dozen Democratic senators.
The message echoed what the Legislative Black Caucus told Ferguson in a January meeting.
They said if there was going to be $100 million to beef up the ranks of law enforcement, there should be at least as much to shore up social services and other supportive programs in communities.
“It can’t be all cops all the time,” said Rep. Kristine Reeves, D-Federal Way, chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, following the meeting. “We want to invest in public safety. We want to invest in strong and strategic public safety that meets all communities’ needs.”
Ultimately the bill passed by margins of 55-42 in the House and 30-19 in the Senate. Only five Republican lawmakers, including Holy, supported the bill.
Reeves, who did vote for it, stood alongside Ferguson as he signed the bill Monday.
“I don’t think every community is going to hire a cop,” she said. “The whole point of this legislation was, how do we give local communities local control to determine what best suits their public safety needs.”
How it works
The Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission will develop and administer the grant program. As written, the state dollars must be allotted by June 30, 2028.
Cities and counties can access the grant money if they’ve already imposed either of two existing public safety sales taxes.
In addition, the bill offers local governments the ability to adopt a new 0.1% sales tax without voter approval to pay for criminal justice expenses. 
The local sales tax revenue could go toward costs such as public defenders, domestic violence services, and programs to help connect formerly incarcerated people with jobs.
Lawmakers also decided governments can’t impose the new tax if voters have rejected a similar tax proposal in the past two years.
The new law sets other criteria for qualifying for grant dollars. 
For example, 25% of officers would have to complete a 40-hour crisis intervention training. The bill originally set this benchmark at 80%. 
Other hurdles departments must clear to access the money include implementing model policies on use-of-force and other issues, completing trauma-informed training for all officers and complying with a law that restricts police from helping with federal immigration enforcement.
Ferguson made the grant program a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign because, he said, Washington is ranked last in the nation in police staffing per capita. 
When asked Monday if this law is enough to move the needle, he said, “I don’t know the answer. It’s going to help.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1620-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

(Photo by Illustration Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Lawmakers on a Senate panel approved measures meant to bolster vaccine uptake and better prepare for future outbreaks in divided votes Monday, showing some vaccine doubts spurred by the pandemic have persisted in New Jersey.
Both measures received votes of 5-3 from the Senate’s health committee Monday, with all Democrats voting yes and all Republicans opposed. The first bill would require automatic enrollment in the state’s vaccine registry, with some ability to opt out. The other is a resolution urging the state’s residents to get immunized as vaccination rates fall and residents again contract some diseases once thought to be eradicated within the United States.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week reported 1,024 confirmed measles cases across 31 states — including three in New Jersey — so far in 2025, up sharply from the 285 confirmed cases reported for all of 2024. Three, including two unvaccinated children, have died after contracting measles this year.
“As a pediatrician, words cannot express the angst that is felt in our profession when we know these deaths were preventable,” said Dr. Jennifer Chuang, vice president-elect of the New Jersey chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. 
The vaccine registry bill would require individuals not already enrolled in the New Jersey Immunization Information System, the state’s vaccine registry, to be entered there when they next receive a vaccine.
It would allow patients — or their parents or guardians — to file written requests not to be entered into the registry, though another portion of the bill would allow the commissioner of health to deny such requests during public health emergencies or outbreaks of communicable diseases, among some others.
“By making the NJIIS registry an opt-out system rather than an opt-in, the state will be able to gather more data to be better prepared for the next pandemic,” said Sen. Joe Vitale (D-Middlesex), the legislation’s prime sponsor and the panel’s chair.
Under existing law, children born beginning in 1998 are automatically enrolled in the registry unless their parent or guardian opts out.
Critics of the bill said automatic enrollment could turn some away from vaccination.
“I think that this could end up having a, once again, unintended consequence of people who may have ordinarily gone in and gotten a certain vaccine deciding not to because now they’re automatically put into a registry because of any sort of potential threat of any sort of outbreak, even if it’s inapplicable to why the person’s going in,” said Sen. Holly Schepisi (R-Bergen).
The resolution, a type of legislation with limited force of law, urges the Department of Health to increase awareness of measles within New Jersey, like by sending mailers on the benefits of vaccines and how to obtain them. The department is not required to comply with the resolution’s urgings.
Dr. Susan Boruchoff, director of clinical services and education at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School’s immunology and infectious diseases division, noted that the nation had “just about completely eradicated measles from this country.”
“We had declared it eradicated — completely gone,” Boruchoff said. “To have cases is different.”
The rise in measles cases has coincided with declines in uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, more commonly called the MMR vaccine. Statewide, 90.4% of New Jersey teens aged 13 to 17 had received two doses of the MMR vaccine, the Department of Health said in an August 2024 brief.
Uptake rates for the MMR vaccine, which is typically administered to children no older than six, are lower in some counties, according to Chuang.
In Ocean County, 84.8% of students met school vaccination requirements in the 2023-2024 school year. Researchers have said a 95% vaccination rate is needed to maintain herd immunity against measles.
Anti-vaccine activists who testified to oppose the resolution charged vaccines were broadly ineffective, citing prevention rates for flu vaccines, which target specific prominent strains of influenza and vary in efficacy year-to-year.
There’s little doubt the full Senate could find the votes to approve the measure, though protests over past vaccine measures could make that search more difficult.
In late 2019, months before New Jersey reported its first case of COVID-19, thousands of anti-vaccine protestors descended on the Statehouse for days of concerted protests targeting a bill that would have ended the state’s religious exemption to school, child care, and university vaccine requirements.
Those protests — which included an appearance from anti-vaccine campaigner Robert Kennedy Jr., who is now U.S. secretary of health and human services, and enough calls to jam clog members’ phone systems — stalled the legislation after peeling away support from a handful of Democrats in the Senate.

Lucy Renaud and Kingsten Zenick are reporters with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship, on assignment for the Montpelier BridgeFive years of survival through a global pandemic, historic flooding and a withering moviegoing crowd, and the Savoy Theater is still standing.The two-screen theater in downtown Montpelier remains a hangout for people who want to share their love of cinema, a role its owners are dedicated to keeping up. “Reality is, if you don’t see a movie in the theaters, you can watch it later and watch it at home. So we have to make the experience unique; it has to be special to make you come out and watch the movie here,” said owner James O’Hanlon. “Part of that is just what we are showing: Showing films that leave people completely moved and almost as if their lives have been changed — that’s what we are here for.”The rise of streaming services as people’s preferred movie-viewing mechanism has forced theaters across the country to close their doors. Vermont hasn’t escaped those headwinds: Merrill’s Roxy Cinema in Burlington shuttered this past fall, ending a 43-year run in the state’s biggest city.But with post-flood renovations completed in the basement and upgrades to the theater’s upstairs pending, O’Hanlon and crew are hitting back against the streaming surge. The plan? Focusing on a curated selection of arthouse and indie flicks, promoting local filmmakers and offering wine and beer alongside the usual popcorn and candy.The Savoy first opened under Rick Winston in 1981. Alongside the folks at Capitol Theater, a more traditional theater that had operated for decades around the corner, Winston helped foster a local following of film lovers in the city before selling to Terry Youk in 2009.Youk recruited several local carpenters and volunteers to help with major renovations on the building, including the transformation of what was originally a basement video store into a second theater room. Among those who volunteered a day to help with renovations was O’Hanlon, who eventually bought the place from Youk in 2016. He recalls instantly falling in love with the Savoy. The theater is one of the few spots for arthouse films in the state. To O’Hanlon, it felt like home.“I look at my role as sort of the steward or curator of facilitating what it’s gonna take to keep this place going,” he said. “And I love movies too. That’s why I believe in it and keep it alive.”He understands streaming at home is typically the more affordable and easier option these days. And generational divides in moviegoing habits have been tricky to navigate: “The older crowd is the loyal base,” he said. Younger people — less so. But he feels a theater can offer something you just can’t get from your laptop or living room.“Certain films are cinematic,” he said, invoking that elusive sense of spectacle, grandness. “And you’re gonna lose something if you don’t watch it on a real screen like that.”And there’s something special, he said, about the collective buzz of a theater audience all tuned in to the same experience.Closing shop in 2020 because of Covid — and again for almost nine weeks after the 2023 floods — only reinforced the idea of getting people to come out and be together.The Savoy goes beyond screenings to host panel talks, rom-com-themed craft nights, cinema club meetings and showings of staff favorites. The latter, a series called “Movies We Love,” focuses on older films. “That will draw in a new audience who hasn’t seen them before, as well as people who have seen them before but love to come and see the films again,” O’Hanlon said. The theater also looks to bolster the local film community by getting involved with the annual Green Mountain Film Festival. The multiday event, held in Montpelier, features screenings in both the city’s theaters and has been running for more than two decades. Last year it returned from a four-year, pandemic-driven break.In the end, the Savoy’s persistence only exists because of people who care. O’Hanlon is quick to credit local support for the theater’s staying in business. “This place only exists because of the community here,” he said. “Not because of me. It’s here because the people in this community love it.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  In Montpelier, the Savoy’s show goes on despite theater industry slump.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/savoy-theatre-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

The Trump administration is waging economic warfare against Massachusetts by turning political points into lethal policies that weaken higher education, life sciences, maritime trade, and tourism -- key pillars of our economy that account for about one-third of the state’s gross domestic product. 
The post Massachusetts is under economic attack  appeared fi[...]","THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION is waging economic warfare against Massachusetts by turning political points into lethal policies that weaken several of our pillar industries: higher education, life sciences, maritime trade,  and tourism. These industries account for about one-third of the state’s gross domestic product. Recently, I completed a study assessing the near and longer-term impact of these actions on state economic growth, jobs and tax revenue collection. The study confirmed that Massachusetts is disproportionately affected by the policy trifecta — deep cuts in federal funding, high trade tariffs, and immigration crackdowns. Collectively, these policies are a giant wrecking ball to the state’s economy.   Start with the White House’s federal spending cuts. At the center of Massachusetts’s knowledge-based economy is higher education and life sciences, accounting for almost 20 percent of GDP.  The state is the third largest recipient of National Institutes of Health funding, totaling $3.5 billion annually, spread out over 6,000 grants and 220 recipients. Grant recipients include colleges, universities, medical centers, and research institutions. Mass General Brigham is at the top of the list, garnering over $655 million.  Federal funding strengthens the state’s “eds and meds” economy, fueling biotech, drug discovery, and innovation.  This funding supports over 140,000 jobs, generating spinoff technologies and startups, creating even more jobs — a multiplier effect that, at 2.5 times, swells the yearly economic benefit to $9 billion. Deep NIH cuts in 2026 could reduce economic activity by $1.4 to $2.2 billion, with a loss of 14,000 jobs.  If cuts persist, losses could reach 64,000 by 2028. The higher-skilled brain drain has started as scientists and researchers relocate to countries that provide better biotech-friendly opportunities. These cuts, if not stopped, could eventually undermine the state’s dominant position in life sciences.  Trade is also an important driver, accounting for over 9 percent of the state’s economic activity.  Massachusetts trades over $62 billion in goods annually, with Canada, China, and Mexico its largest trading partners.  Having a trading surplus, Massachusetts sells more goods than it buys.  Typical exports include medical devices, high-tech instruments, and pharmaceuticals.  Purchases include gasoline, motor vehicles, lumber and electricity.  Tariffs have proven to be a destructive economic policy, fueling higher costs, damaging market confidence, spending and shrinking trade. By 2026, tariff hikes could erase $12.8 billion in state economic growth, almost $1 billion in tax revenue, and up to 79,000 jobs.   If not lessened, the “tariff war” could also become a transmission mechanism for the next recession. In an ominous sign, US first quarter GDP declined. Should this trend persist, the nation could hit full recession by June, and Massachusetts would follow. If a recession occurs, economic losses to the state could double.   The immigrant population, totaling 1.4 million people, is vital to the Massachusetts economy.  Foreign-born residents account for 20 percent of the state’s population, 23 percent of the labor force, and 25 percent of entrepreneurs. The state ranks fifth in the nation in percentage of foreign-born residents, even above Texas.  Foreign-born workers support the lower-end service industries and highest value-add STEM industries.  Annual state and local taxes paid by immigrants top $7 billion. The undocumented immigrant workforce of 400,000 is concentrated in several industries including construction, food services, manufacturing, and health care.  An immigration crackdown will also shrink the flow of legal immigrants needed to fill job openings and spur future economic growth. Last year, Massachusetts’s labor supply growth was generated entirely by incoming immigrants. Given the state’s low unemployment rates, even a modest reduction in the immigrant workforce would lead to a significant labor shortage. In 2026, tighter immigration policies could cost the state up to $3.9 billion in lost spending, $481 million in lost tax revenue, and 45,000 fewer workers, over 4,000 of whom are entrepreneurs. Government policies can also have damaging ripple effects. Last year, 82,000 international students enrolled in our higher education institutions, spending $3.9 billion and supporting about 36,000 jobs. Travel bans, visa cancelations, student deportations, and threats to block foreign students from universities have elevated fear and anxiety. Unfriendly immigration policies could dampen international student enrollments and financially harm area colleges and universities. Northeastern University, Boston University, Harvard, MIT, and UMass Amherst top the list with the highest concentration of international students.  On a statewide basis, a 10 percent enrollment decline could cost higher education $390 million annually.   Anti-immigration policies could also harm the state’s vibrant $24 billion tourist industry, which accounts for almost 4 percent of GDP. Each year, over 50 million people visit the Bay State, over 2.1 million of whom are foreign visitors.  A 30 percent drop in foreign visitors would cost over $1 billion through 2028.   In response to this economic attack, Massachusetts should plan and respond aggressively.  Gov. Healey’s recently announced state hiring freeze is a good first step. But other actions need to be taken. The governor’s office should gain valuable stakeholder input and create a detailed “Mass.  Strong” action plan.  Similar to under Covid, given the current extent of economic uncertainty, for the FY 2026 budget, state legislators should refrain from adopting a full-year budget and endorse month-to-month spending plans until the full impact of White House moves is clearer. Stress-testing must be part of the budgeting process, including analysis of how the state would handle moderate to severe reductions in federal Medicaid reimbursement.  Legal challenges against Trump administration orders should also be intensified; doing so will throw sand in the works, reducing policy harm. To magnify the state’s legal punch, greater funds than previously proposed by the House should be allocated to the attorney general To protect the state’s leadership in life sciences and counter lost NIH funding, a public-private partnership applying a venture capital model approach should be created.  Massachusetts also needs to protect its labor force supply and assert itself as a welcoming and safe place for immigrants to live, work, and study.  Lastly, a targeted campaign to encourage foreign tourists to visit the Bay State should also be undertaken. Doing so will help, reduce the economic blow of Trump anti-immigration policies. Responding to the economic threat in a planned, coordinated, and timely manner will also help Massachusetts better prepare for the economic uncertainty and wobbly economy that is most likely ahead.  Mark Williams is a finance professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business and past president of the Boston Economic Club. The post Massachusetts is under economic attack  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Massachusetts-General-Hospital-2-2-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 18:08:08.053426

(Photo by Marga Buschbell-Steeger/Getty Images)State officials say a new Technology and Innovation Office within New Mexico’s Economic Development Department is expected to advance economic growth in the state and provide funding for startup companies.
House Bill 20, sponsored by Rep. Meredith Dixon (D-Albuquerque) during the most recent legislative session, establishes the Technology and Innovation Office, as well as the Research, Development and Deployment Fund with more than $90 million appropriated to support early tech businesses; match funds for research and development; support recruitment and retention; and boost New Mexico’s quantum technologies sector. 
“There is a lot going on in this state. We have some of the best talent and technology coming out of the labs and our universities,” Dixon told Source NM. “I would say that one of the most important things we can do is make sure that the companies that start here are able to stay here.”
According to a news release from the EDD, the department’s new division will “absorb the existing Office of Strategy, Science and Technology” and the office’s director, Nora Meyers Sackett, will continue in her role.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed the bill on April 9 and it goes into effect on July 1. 
“New Mexico’s trajectory in the fields of science and technology is clear, and this landmark investment accelerates that,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “With our deep bench in innovation, we’re creating momentum that will drive prosperity well into the future.”
HB20 also establishes the Technology and Innovation Network Advisory Board, representing New Mexico’s national labs, universities, the private sector and several other economic areas, and will help administer the Research, Development and Deployment Fund.
Dixon noted that in a 2021 report, the Economic Development Department identified nine target industries to help diversify the state’s economy, including aerospace; biosciences; cybersecurity; film and television; outdoor recreation; sustainable and value-added agriculture; intelligent manufacturing; global trade; and sustainable and green energy. She added that these sectors offer “high-growth” and “high-paying” jobs for a wide range of New Mexicans.
“New Mexico is uniquely positioned in a number of these high growth science and technology sectors,” Dixon said. “This is the time when the state needs to commit to supporting these industries and really getting them off the ground and having an entity in state government that supports and works with these industries to make sure that they have the tools that they need.”

(Lily O'Shea Becker/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas reproductive rights advocacy group, backed by a Washington, D.C. law firm, sued state officials over a new law banning financial contributions from “foreign nationals” to support or oppose constitutional amendments.
The group, Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, argued in a complaint filed in federal court Friday that House Bill 2106, which passed the Legislature in April and is set to go into effect July 1, is broad, vague and unconstitutional. The group said the bill inhibits its ability to advocate for or against future constitutional amendments. Kansans for Constitutional Freedom and its donors have received contributions from foreign nationals, the lawsuit said.
The complaint drew a connection between HB 2106 and opposition to the 2022 ballot measure that sought to limit reproductive rights. Voters rejected the proposed constitutional amendment by a 59-41 margin.
“Rather than accept that an overwhelming majority of Kansas voters rejected the 2022 Amendment on its merits, opponents of abortion rights blamed ‘foreign influence’ for their failure at the ballot box,” the complaint said. “Moreover, HB 2106 was meant to make it harder for KCF specifically to engage in advocacy related to Kansas constitutional ballot initiatives.”
Kansans for Constitutional Freedom was the primary engine of opposition to the 2022 amendment, spending more than $11 million in a statewide campaign encouraging voter turnout. In the lawsuit, the organization said it intends to advocate for or against constitutional amendments in the future.
The lawsuit references a forthcoming constitutional amendment that will appear on voters’ ballots in August 2026 that seeks to elect Kansas Supreme Court justices by popular vote, abandoning the current nomination and appointment system. The organization argues the restrictions within HB 2106 are “targeted not at the ‘foreign interests’ Kansas claims it means to silence, but at those who associate with them.”
“Through a series of exceedingly broad, highly invasive, and at times completely incomprehensible restrictions, HB 2106 will muzzle the speech of U.S. citizens and domestic organizations far more effectively than that of the foreign nationals Kansas claims it means to target,” the lawsuit read.
HB 2106 retroactively prohibits indirect or direct contributions from a foreign national used for promoting or opposing a constitutional amendment. Any person involved in campaigning for or against an amendment already has to submit a series of campaign finance reports, and the bill added a new provision requiring non-foreign donors to certify they haven’t received more than $100,000 in the preceding four years from foreign nationals. If the law goes into effect, any person who knowingly received $100,000 or more in contributions from a foreign national in the past four years is barred from participating in constitutional advocacy for up to four years.
The lawsuit named nine members of the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission, the commission’s executive director, Wade Wiebe, and Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who is permitted under HB 2106 to bring criminal charges against anyone who violates its provisions. The ethics commission, which is set to be renamed as the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission under a new law that takes effect in July, is able to bring civil action against those who violate HB 2106.
During the bill’s legislative hearings, proponents took particular issue with the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a left-leaning dark money group that has received millions from foreigners and involved itself in ballot measure campaigns across the U.S. Kansans for Constitutional Freedom took in more than $1.5 million in donations from the fund in 2022, according to Open Secrets, an independent website that tracks money in politics.
Topeka-based law firm Irigonegaray and Revenaugh, a criminal defense and personal injury firm, and the D.C.-based Elias Law Group, which has challenged and drawn ire from the Trump administration, are representing Kansans for Constitutional Freedom.
Both firms also are involved in the recently filed lawsuit on behalf of three Kansas advocacy organizations challenging a new law that eliminates the three-day grace period for mail-in ballots.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pt.2-rachel-after-win-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 17:07:29.899263

  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“Melissa’s family desperately wants to know where she is, and the Tribe is fully committed to helping its law enforcement agency exhaust every investigative resource to find her and bring her home,” said T.J. Bill, LDF Tribal Police Chief, in a press release.
Beson is a Native American female, 5’7”, with a medium build, brown hair and brown eyes.  She has numerous tattoos, including on her neck, arms and legs.
She was reported missing on March 23, 2025.  The last confirmed sighting of her was on Monday, March 17, 2025, during the late afternoon. At that time, Beson was observed walking on Indian Village Road, near Wayman Lane, in Lac du Flambeau. When last seen, she wore red sweatpants, a black sleeveless shirt and a gray sweatshirt. 
“The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department (LDFTPD) remains steadfast in its investigation into Melissa’s disappearance,” said Bill.  “Every lead, no matter how small, is being thoroughly pursued to find her. Authorities have searched relentlessly in the area where Melissa was last seen, as well as other areas of interest.  LDFTPD Officers and assisting agencies have conducted grid searches on foot, have deployed high-tech drones and airplanes, and have searched using specially trained canines. To date, over 3,400 acres have been carefully searched.”
Based on the information his office has received, Bill told the Wisconsin Examiner two theories about Beson’s disappearance have been pursued: she either walked out into the forest and became lost and is probably deceased, or she left the area and is living with other persons.
Besides the large-scale searches for Beson, coordination with other law enforcement agencies has been conducted regarding reports of Beson being in another community in the Wausau area, but follow-up investigations have yet to produce any information on Beson’s whereabouts.
“The reward offered by the Tribe will be apportioned as deemed just by the Tribe, in the event, for example, multiple credible tips are received, which lead to the discovery of Melissa Beson and/or the arrest and charging of anyone responsible for her disappearance,” said Bill.
Employees of law enforcement and correctional agencies are not eligible to collect the reward.
Anyone with information regarding Beson’s disappearance or location is asked to call the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717 or the Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441.

Thomas/Getty Images)Nine Florida Democratic lawmakers sent a letter Monday calling on members of Congress to oppose efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.
In all, 562 state lawmakers from 50 states and the District of Columbia signed the letter a letter.
The effort was organized by the State Innovation Exchange’s Reproductive Freedom Leadership Council (SiX RFLC) and  comes after anti-abortion lawmakers in Congress released a draft budget cutting off Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from Medicaid funds.
Reps. LaVon Bracy Davis, Kevin Chambliss, Anna Eskamani, Rita Harris, Dianne Hart, and Felicia Robinson signed the letter. So did Sens. Shevrin Jones, Tina Polsky, and Darryl Rouson.
The State Innovation Exchange was founded in 2014 when the Center for State Innovation, the Progressive States Network, and the American Legislative and Issue Campaign Exchange (ALICE) merged. SiX works to promote racial, gender, social, and economic justice.
According to Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) one in three women have been to a Planned Parenthood health center for care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In Florida, almost 100,000 patients relied on Planned Parenthood health centers for care last year – from birth control and cancer screenings, to STI treatment and wellness visits.

“Planned Parenthood is an irreplaceable part of our health care system in Florida,” Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said in a prepared release.
“These lawmakers understand that ‘defunding’ Planned Parenthood would shut down health centers and leave patients across our state without access to essential and affordable health care. We are proud to work alongside them to continue fighting relentlessly for access to affordable reproductive health care for all Floridians.”
Indeed, Planned Parenthood officials told the Florida Phoenix earlier this month that their clinics expanded their offerings in Florida after the state’s six week abortion ban took effect on May 1, 2024.
“We’ve expanded our service line. I think it’s important for the community to know we do much more than abortion care. We do vasectomies, we do prenatal care, we do fertility care. We do menopausal care. It’s not just abortions and STDs (sexually transmitted diseases).
“But I think the community is learning that. There’s a large need for Planned Parenthood,” Cherise Felix, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood of South, East, and North Florida told the Florida Phoenix.

The legislation, which was assured of passage by the Senate later Monday, is the product of intense negotiations resolved with unusual alacrity by traditional antagonists at the state Capitol on business and insurance issues: unions vs. business, and trial lawyers vs. insurers.
Without the legislative clarification Monday, public and private employers were facing a 235% jump in premiums on workers’ compensation, costing municipal, state and private employers an estimated $320 million a year, according to state and business analysis.
The unanimous court decision issued March 18 in Gardner vs. Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services focused on a narrow question with far-reaching impact: How much discretion do administrative law judges overseeing workers’ compensation claims have in awarding temporary benefits?
Contradicting long-standing practice and a ruling by the Appellate Court, the high court found “the administrative law judge has the discretion to award a claimant who has reached maximum medical improvement other benefits under the Workers’ Compensation Act, such as total or partial incapacity benefits.”
“And while that might seem like a very simple holding from the Supreme Court, the effect that that will have on our state and our municipalities is really very radical,” Rep. Jack Fazzino, D-Meriden, vice chair of the Judiciary Committee, said in the House debate.
The court ruling came at an awkward point in the legislative session, after most deadlines for filing and holding hearings on bills. But there was widespread acknowledgement that a quick clarification of the underlying law was needed to stabilize workers’ compensation costs.
“It was critically important, given that the decision in Gardner essentially undermined the 1993 reforms, or a good piece of them, which led to decreased premiums over a decade, balanced benefits and having some of the safest workplaces in the world,” said Chris DiPentima, the president of the Connecticut and Business Industry Association.
Fazzino said premiums in Meriden, one of the communities in his district, would increase by $1.2 million. Lager cities would face much larger jumps. None of it was anticipated before the March 18 ruling.
“I don’t feel comfortable going back to my city and saying, ‘Hey, by the way, here’s a $1.2 million increase in workers’ compensation premiums that you didn’t account for,’” Fazzino said.
Eric George, the president of the Insurance Association of Connecticut, said, “All of us were scrambling.”
He noted that representatives of business, municipalities, insurers, trial lawyers and labor quickly met for negotiations overseen by legislators who demanded and obtained a quick consensus.
“That does not happen often,” he said.
The high court’s analysis, in a decision written by Justice Nora Dannehy, turned on what the court called a plain-language reading of the law, not the intent of the legislature in 1993 or interpretation of agencies in subsequent years.
“The present appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation.,” Dannehy wrote. “Although this court will afford deference to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory provision that has been ‘subjected to judicial scrutiny or consistently applied by the agency over a long period of time’ and is reasonable…the board’s interpretation of the specific provisions at issue in this appeal has neither been time-tested nor subject to judicial scrutiny to warrant deferential treatment.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7510-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 17:07:29.899263

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)The secretary of state’s use of a government building – one that houses the department she oversees – to announce her candidacy for governor violated Michigan’s campaign finance laws, the Department of Attorney General said Monday.
That said, the department noted it did not have the authority to impose any civil penalties against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, nor any criminal penalties outlined in the law.
Benson jumped into the 2026 gubernatorial ring on January 22 with a press conference held in the lobby of the Austin building. Benson said then that the announcement was being held inside the building due to the cold weather. Reporters at the event questioned whether other candidates could also use the lobby for similar announcements, with some noting that other candidates had not been allowed to do so in the past.
Benson says she’s focused on ‘efficiency and transparency’ in Michigan governor campaign

Benson told reporters that other candidates could use the lobby if they’d like to announce their campaigns – which led to complaints from Republicans.
In a letter sent to Benson on Monday, Joshua Booth, chief of the opinions division with the Department of Attorney General, said the secretary of state had violated a portion of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act.
That said, Booth wrote that the Jocelyn Benson for Governor campaign committee had not violated the law because it was not a public body and because there was no allegation that the campaign committee was acting on behalf of a government body.
The act prohibits candidates from using public funds, personnel, office space, equipment and other property paid for by public resources. In that regard, Booth said Benson herself violated the act.
“Secretary Benson invited members of the press inside the Austin Building and then conducted a press conference, professionally dressed, during the day, in the lobby of the building that houses her office,” Booth wrote. “She gave no indication that would lead a reasonable person viewing the press conference to believe that she was there on her ‘personal time.’ Instead, the circumstances would lead a reasonable person to believe that Secretary Benson was acting as secretary of state with the authority of the Department of State, which is a ‘public body,’ to invite members of the press inside her office building and use the lobby for the press conference.”
As to Benson’s belief that other candidates could also use the Austin building to announce their candidacy, the law does allow for the use of public buildings for campaign events or candidate announcements. But Booth said her belief was misplaced because the Department of Technology, Management and Budget oversees the building, and therefore, the facility was not one that any candidate or committee had an equal opportunity to use.
Benson’s committee also raised First Amendment concerns, and argued that any violation of the act enforced against it would in turn violate her constitutional rights. But Booth said limiting candidates from using the building was a legitimate purpose because such a gathering could interfere with the entering, exiting and the general business of those working inside the building. 
A violation of the act carries a civil penalty of a fine not more than $1,000 imposed by the Department of State and a conciliation process helps determine the amount of the fine. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Department of State can refer the matter to the attorney general’s office.
The act is, however, silent on how the Department of Attorney General should resolve a complaint against the Secretary of State if it’s determined that a violation occurred. Booth said there are no provisions establishing a conciliation process, other informal method of resolving the complaint, or giving authority to the attorney general’s office to order a hearing or issue a civil fine following a hearing. There is also no provision allowing the secretary of state to appeal a fine imposed by the Department of Attorney General.
The same goes for criminal penalties, Booth said. The act states that anyone in violation of Michigan campaign finance law is guilty of a misdemeanor, but because the complaint was referred to the attorney general by the secretary of state, the attorney general’s office lacks the authority to charge Benson with a misdemeanor.
Booth said that it may sound odd and seem unfair that Benson is subject to the Campaign Finance Act’s rules but none of its penalties, but the Legislature never expressly gave the attorney general the authority to enforce the law against a secretary of state.
“Consequently, the attorney general is left with no choice but to simply identify the violation, remind the secretary of state of her obligations under the MCFA, and warn her against violating them in the future,” Booth wrote. “That said, it is by no means unusual for the Secretary of State to resolve campaign finance complaints with a similar reminder and warning. … Under the circumstances, resolving these complaints with a reminder and warning is the appropriate sanction, but it is also important to take this opportunity to point out the lack of enforcement options available to the attorney general under the current language of the MCFA.”

Phaneuf discusses his story about budget negotiations in Connecticut and looming battles over funding priorities.,"Connecticut lawmakers have three weeks to pass a biennial budget. How are things looking?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Keith M. Phaneuf to discuss his article, “One skirmish over the CT budget is over, but the big battle looms,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Keith’s story here.
WSHU: Connecticut has a huge surplus, yet we have a situation where there’s a big debate about what to do with the budget and how to make things work in the out years. Why?
KP: Why is it not so cut and dry? Well, what we’re really have going on behind all of this is a fundamental debate over how much one generation, the current generation, should be paying to solve a problem created by three or four that came before it. That was the group that really created the pension debt that made headlines, national headlines about Connecticut, all throughout the 2010s. We still owe about $35 billion to our pension funds, benefits we’ve promised to people, but we haven’t saved for. The State has a plan to gradually pay all that down through about the early 2050s, but we’re using our budget caps and budget controls to generate huge surpluses. And I almost hate to use that word because it implies that money is not needed for these programs. We’re actually leaching dollars out of education, health care, social services, transportation, everything else, and we’re using it to make extra pension payments. Some folks have said we’ve overcorrected, and one generation is now paying too much. But that is why, that’s the shortest answer I can give you, why we would have a huge surplus. We can’t decide if there’s enough money for everything else. It’s because we’re trying to create huge surpluses to pay down pension debt.
WSHU: Now, I sensed a lot of frustration from House Speaker Matt Ritter (D) last week that the budget negotiations were not going well. Why? What was the issue here?
KP: The reason they’re not going well is, again, it goes back to this dynamic that I was just discussing with you. What’s happening is we are getting to a point where these budget caps that really have been in place in their current iterations, their current settings since about 2017 are becoming unbearable. And some folks may say, ‘Well, what changed? Why is this program that’s leeching money out of everything else? Why is that becoming too hard to bear now, if it’s been in place since 2017?’
The reason for that is that we have had, I don’t want to call it good fortune, because it’s related to a pandemic that killed so many people. But because of the pandemic, Connecticut received billions of dollars in emergency federal grants. We know them by the acronym ARPA, American Rescue Plan Act funds, and think of it almost as fiscal novocaine, while we were extracting all this money from the budget via the guardrails by the budget caps to make pension contributions. We had this emergency money that we could spend outside of the cap system, outside of the budget, to take the place of the money that the budget caps were removing. So you didn’t feel the loss of all that money. Well. Now these ARPA dollars have been exhausted, and for the first time, Connecticut is learning what it is like to take eight to 10% each year out of its budget and set it aside for extra-special pension debt reduction payments. And it’s very, very painful.
WSHU: Now, on top of that, we have a situation with the Trump administration in Washington cutting back on a lot of money that was coming, apart from the fact that the ARPA funds are gone. We now have the regular funds, like Medicaid, for instance. The talk is about cutting that back, and the state would have to make up the difference. How are they trying to deal with that?
KP: That is the double whammy of all double whammies, because the problems that we’re facing immediately, right now with Medicaid, don’t even deal with Congress and President Trump. That’s simply the fact that demand is much greater than we anticipated. As you point out, though, Ebong, we have a whole other problem to deal with this summer or early this fall. Once Congress and President Trump finish cutting the federal budget, we anticipate losing hundreds of millions of dollars, at a minimum, in Medicaid funding, and that’s going to be a whole other problem. I don’t think the math works any way other than simply scaling back these budget caps and not trying to pay down pension debt as fast as we currently are. That’s not a moral judgment. That’s literally just doing the math. I don’t see where you come up with the money any other way. And I should have also mentioned, even at the pace that we’re paying down pension debt.
Now, some folks have said, well, isn’t it worth it? In a couple of years, this problem will be over. That’s not the case, even with all the extra money we’ve poured into our pension funds. The estimate now is maybe we’ll have this problem solved instead of the early 2050s maybe by the mid 2040s The problem is just too big to obliterate quickly, meaning it’s one thing to say, well, can our social service and healthcare and municipal aid and K 12 school programs suffer for a year or two? No, we’re really asking, can they suffer for a couple more decades and then we’ll stop leeching all this money out to pay down pension debt. That’s the other problem you don’t hear a lot of in the debate, which is, this is not a problem we’re going to be done with overnight, even if we keep the guardrails and the budget caps at their current settings.
WSHU: Okay. And the thing about the budget caps is that Governor Lamont, who is a Democrat, is being backed by the minority GOP in saying they don’t want to move those guardrails, and the Democrats, who are in the majority in the legislature, want to do so. Is there room for a compromise? There has to be some type of compromise to get a budget deal, which we need in the next couple of weeks.
KP: That’s a good way to put it. You know, sometimes there has to be a compromise. We saw earlier this session, the Democratic and Republican legislators compromise and award special education money to towns, even though both parties knew it was going to push this current fiscal year’s budget over the spending cap, because Republican districts were losing money in their schools because of special education costs, just like Democrats were losing it. I think as the finances get too tight, folks who say, no, I want to leave things just the way they are, are going to realize it’s okay to do that again.
For the last few years, when there was all this federal ARPA money, it’s like, Oh, you just lost $10 to the guardrails. Here’s $8 that came from Washington and ARPA funds. Now it’s not so painful. Now you lose $10 and there’s nothing to offset it. I think that’s going to force this situation.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)SCRANTON — On a gravel road northwest of this small Kansas town, a picturesque creek with overhanging trees shimmers with brilliant shades of green.
The beauty, though, hasn’t made up for the aggravation caused by high floodwaters that sweep the wooden bridge over that creek off its moorings to land about 30 yards or so away from the roadway, leaving the road impassable for area farmers, said Ryan Fine, Osage County public works director.
“That old wood one, it kept floating away. If we got a big, heavy rain, it would float down there, and we’d have to grab it out of the trees,” he said, gesturing down the creek. “The last time it happened, I said, ‘Leave that sucker in the trees. I gotta figure this out.’ ”
The cost of a new bridge, done with the typical bridge construction the county uses, would have been more than $300,000, Fine said. Instead, with the help of the Soy Transportation Coalition and the Kansas Soybean Association, the total bridge price was about $106,000, attributed to financial help and building a different style of bridge.
The new culvert bridge has walls, called headwalls, attached to the sides of the culvert and wingwalls that come out from there to help support the bridge, Fine said. Then large beams are set into the ground to a depth of four or five feet, he said. The top is covered with rock. 
“Even if there is erosion from high water where it does go over this road, this should stay locked in place,” Fine said, then added with a smile, “OK, can’t say it would always lock in place, because water can do some amazing things. But this is going to give us a better chance of it staying put where it needs to be.”
 
First in Kansas
Fine said he remembered that Raylen Phelon, a commissioner at large for the Kansas Soybean Commission and vice-chairman of the STC, spoke at county meetings about help available for transportation projects.
He reached out and as a result, Osage County’s bridge became the first project in the state to use soybean checkoff funds set aside for such projects through the transportation coalition, Phelon said.
It’s also the first official use of the Soy Transportation Coalition’s report that was put together to offer innovative solutions for replacing and repairing rural bridges, Phelon said. STC is made up of 13 state soybean boards, the American Soybean Association and the United Soybean Board. The organization works to address transportation issues that affect the soy industry’s ability to move products.
The STC innovation report was designed to give counties options to consider when they replaced or repaired bridges, often with a significantly smaller price tag, said Kaleb Little, CEO of the Kansas Soybean Association. So along with $4,500 for the engineering costs on the project, they want to support creative thinking to solve problems that impact soybean farmers, he said.
  A new style of bridge that includes beams driven four or five feet into the ground replaced an old wooden bridge that kept moving downstream when it flooded. (Submitted)
Soybean checkoff
“What I really am tickled about is we’re using checkoff dollars,” Phelon said of the $4,500 check presented to Osage County. “It’s farmers’ checkoff dollars, from when they sell soybeans. It’s one-half of 1%, or a nickel every bushel with the prices right now, and it’s coming right back into the county, to where the farmers are at.”
Using checkoff dollars is a win-win for everyone, from the county and taxpayers to the farmers at the local level, he said. 
Phelon said he became  involved in STC because, as a soybean farmer, he knows how important infrastructure is. It was evident when a small bridge near his Melvern farm was getting to be unsafe, but if it had closed, he would have had to go miles out of his way to transport his crop.
“We can grow fantastic crops, but if you can’t get them to market, it affects your price,” Phelon said. “What are you going to do with an overabundance if you can’t move it? Also, it helps the consumer. If we can get it to them, it’ll help their prices be better.”

Phelon said STC supports projects around the country, including a large project at the Port of Grays Harbor in Washington state. Farmers can’t always make the connection to how that project halfway across the country helps them, he said. 
But two railroads go from the Midwest to Port of Grays, where soybeans are put on ships and sent around the world, Phelon said. 
“So taking products that are grown here in the United States, putting them on a boat and selling them — it helps our price,” he said. “There’s been maybe a little bit of pushback from Kansas farmers to say, well, we don’t sell any soybeans to China. I said wait a minute. Maybe not directly, but if Nebraska is selling them, we’re going to fill that void. And we need to be in that ballgame.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5150150-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Donald Trump has been president for 119 days as of Monday. That comes out to a lawsuit in which Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is a lead plaintiff or participant roughly every six days since the new Trump administration began.
In fact, Neronha has joined so many multistate challenges to the federal government that his office’s website now features a page titled “Federal Action Response” to track his 19 litigious efforts against the commander in chief.
The page includes detailed information on every lawsuit Neronha has led or joined, from a birthright citizenship case filed in New Jersey District Court the day after Trump took office, to the latest pair of victories last week.
Both of last week’s wins happened on Neronha’s home turf, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. Overall, seven of the 19 lawsuits Neronha has joined against the Trump administration have managed to temporarily block executive orders, federal funding cuts, or agency regulations issued by Trump’s cabinet members.
“Since day one, the Trump Administration has taken actions that extend far beyond the President’s constitutional authority,” the landing page reads. “These actions are impacting the rights of Rhode Islanders in real time. But we’re ready.” 
On Friday, May 16, District Judge Mary McElroy granted a request for a temporary court order and ordered the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reinstate federal funding while the case is pending. Rhode Island is one of 24 plaintiffs challenging  the agency’s abrupt termination of $11 billion in pandemic-era public health grants.
On Tuesday, May 13, Chief Judge John McConnell’s preliminary injunction against a Trump executive order targeting library programming and other federal initiatives went into effect. McConnell issued the injunction on May 6, backing the 21 states that rallied against the executive order that led to the Institute of Museum and Library Services placing 85% of its staff on administrative leave. 
“Americans have quickly grown weary of their government attacking them instead of working for them,” Neronha said in a May 14 statement after the injunction became effective.
Neronha joined 21 other attorneys general in the library funding lawsuit, which sought to block an executive order that led to staff reductions and grant cancellations at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which helps mediate labor disputes.
“Above all else, as attorneys general, we have an obligation to protect the residents of our states from harm even when, perhaps especially when, it comes from the federal government,” Neronha’s statement continued. “With this order and many others, we are stopping this President in his tracks, and we will continue to fight every single step of the way.”
The executive order also designated the United States Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund as targets for spending cuts (although these agencies were not part of the state attorneys’ efforts). The EO mandated these federal initiatives “reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function” — in other words, abolish any programming not explicitly required by law. 
But McConnell wrote in his May 6 ruling that this executive maneuver “has effectively usurped Congress’s lawmaking and spending authority — without constitutional or statutory authority permitting them [the federal government] to do so.
McElroy’s ruling came in a lawsuit first filed in April, and deemed that HHS had violated both the Administrative Procedure Act and congressional spending authority.
“The power that HHS has asserted here is a broad one: terminating $11 billion worth of funding based on its determination that the money is no longer necessary,” McElroy wrote in her ruling. “The Court cannot see how it can claim that power based on the history of congressional action described above.”
The pair of rulings reflect the overall legal strategy of Neronha and his blue state counterparts during the second Trump era: to hastily respond to the executive branch’s equally speedy policymaking. Across the 19 lawsuits, states have argued that the Trump administration has repeatedly violated the Administrative Procedure Act, ignored congressional powers, and imposed wide-ranging but often unclear policy and budgeting directives on shaky legal ground. 
“A hacksaw approach to government reduction will never yield positive results for the American people, and we will continue to fight, and win, in court to minimize the harm the Trump Administration is causing the people of this country,” Neronha wrote in a statement after the May 16 ruling. “When the Trump Administration attempts to dismantle these agencies, it is making a targeted, concerted effort to prohibit everyday people from accessing their full potential.”
Six of the 19 cases in which Neronha has participated have been filed U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, including the two most recent filings from May 13: Illinois v. FEMA, and California v. Department of Transportation, both of which challenge challenges immigration enforcement as a prerequisite for federal funding.    
Neronha has been especially busy in April and May, getting involved in 12 of the 19 cases during those two months.
A full list of the 19 cases, with court documents included, is available on the AG’s website.

(Photo by Jerry Redfern / Capital & Main)The “big, beautiful” bill making its way through the United States House of Representatives this week not only would cut federal spending on healthcare on which  40% of New Mexicans rely, but state and federal officials say it also would reduce revenue the state could use to pay for that healthcare itself.
One provision in the 1,116-page spending bill that is making progress in the House would reduce federal oil and gas royalties from 16.75% to 12.5%, undoing a hike Congress and President Joe Biden approved in the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. 
Federal law requires 50% of royalties on federal land to be distributed to states in which production took place, which in 2024 meant that New Mexico received $2.88 billion from federal royalties, the biggest share of any state, according to the State Land Office. 
Reducing the rate back to pre-2022 levels will mean about $480 million less in total royalties the federal government collects between now and 2031, according to the office. In New Mexico, those funds are regularly invested in trust funds the state amasses to pay for services like early childhood education or other programs.
U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) said in a news conference Friday decrying the bill that the provision amounts to a double-whammy for New Mexico, which relies heavily on oil and gas revenue and is also where Medicaid finances more than half of all births. Republicans are helping oil companies increase their sizable profits while making it harder for New Mexico to pay for healthcare, she said.
New Mexico mom, advocates urge Congress to protect safety net programs

“At a time when the Republicans are going to make states pay more for Medicaid, they are taking away the money that New Mexico uses to fund Medicaid,” Leger Fernandez said during a news conference Friday. “This is why we are so angry about this bill. It is a double impact on New Mexico.”
Leger Fernandez cited a May 5 letter Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard wrote to her office that laid out concerns about the Republicans’ approach to federal oil and gas extraction. 
“As the top recipient of federal mineral leasing distributions, the proposed reduction in the minimum royalty  rate… will hit New Mexico’s working families at a time when other federal funding for essential services is being slashed by the Trump Administration,” Garcia Richard wrote in the letter, which her office provided to Source New Mexico. 
This legislative session, state lawmakers created a new Medicaid Trust Fund that aims to generate enough in interest to pay for at least some of what the federal government could cut in Medicaid spending.
New Mexico has the highest per-capita Medicaid enrollment in the nation, 34%, according to the non-partisan health policy research organization KFF. The state is expected to need $8.9 billion in federal Medicaid funding to support its operations this fiscal year. For perspective, New Mexico’s record operating budget for this fiscal year is $10.8 billion. 
NM budget expert expects Medicaid work requirements out of Congress

It’s not entirely clear, however, how money in federal oil and gas royalties would make its way into the Medicaid Trust Fund that lawmakers created for the New Mexico Treasurer’s Office to oversee. The bill creating the fund does not specify, saying only that the fund “consists of distributions, appropriations, gifts, grants and donations.” 
State Land Office spokesperson Joey Keefe referred comment to the State Treasurer’s Office. A spokesperson there did not immediately respond to a request for that information Monday morning. 
In addition to her concerns about the lost federal royalties, Garcia Richard noted that the bill would require the federal government to lease land for oil and gas extraction to companies, even if it’s not in the best interest of taxpayers, by requiring quarterly lease sales, sometimes without competitive bids. 
“By enabling companies to get leases directly without a competitive auction and by requiring that an arbitrary percentage of lands [be] offered at quarterly lease sales, the federal government (and the states that share in this revenue) will receive less value than they should for the parcels,” Garcia Richard wrote. 
She urged Leger Fernandez and other members of the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee to vote against the proposal. Despite her effort, the committee voted to advance the bill two days later.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chaco_Area_OnG_0313_04-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

As of Monday, 108 people across five counties were facing charges in connection with trafficking and selling fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine, said Attorney General Alan Wilson. He announced charges for an initial 64 people in January 2024.
Three people have pleaded guilty. The remaining charges are pending, and the investigation dubbed Operation Devil in Disguise is ongoing, according to his office.

At least six people have died from drug overdoses traced back to the operation, Wilson said. Among the more than 380 charges defendants face are murder, accessory to murder, and conspiracy to commit murder brought against people suspected of selling drugs laced with fentanyl that led to overdoses. Those charges require prosecutors to prove the sellers knew their product was strong enough to be lethal.
Such proof wouldn’t be needed for future charges under a soon-to-be law.
Under a bill passed this year that the governor is expected to sign, the Attorney General’s Office will be able to pursue charges of fentanyl-induced homicide, an offense created by the bill that carries a sentence of up to 30 years for anyone who knowingly “delivers, dispenses or otherwise provides” any amount of fentanyl that kills a person.
“That’s going to be a wonderful tool for law enforcement and prosecutors to use, and that is why we so vigorously advocated for it,” Wilson said.
Most of the fentanyl, which is both potent and cheap, was mixed with cocaine and methamphetamine to either bulk up the amount of the drug sold or increase its strength, Wilson said.
Bill makes anyone who provides a fatal dose of fentanyl in SC a killer

That can be dangerous, since fentanyl carries a higher risk of overdose, said Creighton Waters, the lead prosecutor in the case.
Fentanyl overdoses killed 1,660 people in the state in 2022, according to the Department of Public Health’s most recent data available. That accounted for more than 70% of the total 2,296 overdoses statewide that year, according to department data.
Two milligrams of the opioid can be enough to kill a person, depending on someone’s size, tolerance and past usage, according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. That means every kilogram of fentanyl has the potential to kill 500,000 people, Wilson said.
Investigators believe traffickers have brought 540 kilograms of fentanyl into the state. Officers have confiscated 4 kilograms of fentanyl while investigating the operation, according to the Attorney General’s Office.
“Fentanyl is obviously the biggest narcotics trafficking problem that we face because it is so deadly,” Waters said.

The operation is also believed to have trafficked 850 kilograms of cocaine and 500 kilograms of methamphetamine, Wilson said.
Law enforcement officers have confiscated more than 44 kilograms of cocaine, 10 kilograms of methamphetamine, $1 million in cash suspected of being exchanged for drugs and multiple guns, including assault rifles, according to the office.
In one case, police caught three defendants after watching them exchange 3 kilograms of cocaine outside a house in Greenville, prosecuting attorney Jennifer McKellar said as 11 of the accused appeared in Richland County bond court Monday.
Others were discovered through traffic stops or search warrants.
In several cases, defendants were charged with seemingly unrelated drug crimes that investigators later connected to the larger operation, causing prosecutors to add charges. At least one man continued trafficking drugs from jail, relaying coded instructions to his wife over the jail phone. Others were caught on surveillance cameras and through their phone communications smuggling drugs over state lines, McKellar said.
Legislators in 2023 passed a law creating penalties specific to people caught trafficking fentanyl. Under that law, a person caught trafficking 28 grams of fentanyl or more could be sentenced up to 40 years in prison. A first conviction of trafficking less than 14 grams comes with a sentence of up to 25 years, and a second conviction carries a mandatory 25 years in prison.
As law enforcement more vigorously pursues fentanyl trafficking, they have begun to see the supply drop, Waters said.
“Anecdotally, we’re starting to see some effects of the supply being squeezed a bit by greater efforts at enforcement,” Waters said.
Investigators have traced many of the drugs back to Mexican cartels bringing them in over the country’s southernmost border, Wilson said. People then bring the drugs through Atlanta and up to Greenville, which Wilson called the “front porch” of the state when it comes to drug trafficking.
“This is just a fraction of the army that’s coming for you,” Wilson said his message would be to people continuing to bring drugs into the state. “We will come for you, we will get you and we will put you in prison if you continue to do this.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2405-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

Terrell McKinney recalls Nebraska’s rockier relationship with Malcolm X, the rather rough road to getting the Omaha-born human rights leader into the state’s Hall of Fame.
John Ewing Jr., who last week became Omaha’s first elected Black mayor, was a toddler when Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, and what sticks with him is how Nebraskans early on used him largely as a comparison point with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
Standing out to JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike is the slow march toward gaining communitywide buy-in to build up the Malcolm X memorial birth site and nonprofit foundation she now heads. Burned into her mind is a moment 15 years ago when she thought: “Where’s the people? Where are the people who are going to move this thing forward?”
But they and other fans said they’ve seen increased recognition and understanding in their state of what Malcolm X stood for. Buoyed by his rising national prominence, local voices have championed Malcolm X’s journey as one of self-determination, personal reformation and quest to unify Black people — and have successfully advocated for ways to enshrine his name in the state where he was born.
Efforts intensified as the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birthday approached — and is being observed Monday, May 19.
“There’s a shift of the tide,” McKinney said, for the Black empowerment advocate he says is often misunderstood. “People are actually honoring his legacy and respecting it. It’s a show of understanding of who he was and what he means to North Omaha, the city, and the world.”
 Racial antagonism abandoned

Born Malcolm Little, his family left Omaha after suffering harassment from white supremacists, before Malcolm X was two years old. He evolved from a street hustler who, while in prison, became self-educated and converted to the Nation of Islam. He took the new surname “X” to signify the unknown African surname of his ancestors.
After completing a pilgrimage to Mecca, Malcolm X had a new outlook that abandoned concepts of racial antagonism. He changed his name again and denounced the Nation of Islam, which led to death threats.
At 39 years old, as he was about to give a speech in New York City in 1965, the father of six daughters was shot multiple times at close range by three gunmen identified as members of the Nation of Islam.
McKinney, a lawmaker who represents the North Omaha area where Malcolm X first lived, reflected on the Little family that he said was a target of racism. Malcolm’s father, a minister, was active in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which led to the family’s being harassed. McKinney said the Littles would not have fathomed the recent turn of events in Nebraska.

 Shifts

Consider these milestones:
In May 2024, the state inducted Malcolm X as the 27th person and first African American into Nebraska’s Hall of Fame. Some along the way thought he was too controversial for the hall the Legislature created in 1961 to recognize Nebraskans who have made significant contributions to the state and nation.
Indeed, it took three different nominations over nearly two decades, in 2004, 2007, and 2022, before he was selected in 2022 by a governor-appointed commission that considered public testimony. The formal induction came two years later, with a bronze bust in Malcolm X’s image installed in the State Capitol. Due to legislation passed in 1998, no more than one person can be added to the Hall of Fame every five years.
At the induction, former State Sen. Ernie Chambers quipped about what he saw as a near impossibility: “I never thought in my wildest dream that I would live long enough … to see a white conservative Republican governor in a white ultraconservative state like Nebraska participate in the induction of Malcolm X.”
Also in 2024, the Nebraska Legislature passed a law establishing a “recognition” of Malcolm X every year on his birthday. McKinney had pushed for a state holiday, but that measure stalled. He said financial barriers to designating a paid holiday prompted him to change direction. He called the alternative a “good first step.”
The legislation calls for each May 19, starting this year, to be “set apart for holding suitable exercises in the schools of the state in recognition of the sacrifices of the late Nebraska Hall of Fame inductee El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, Malcolm X and his contributions to the betterment of society.” El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name Malcolm adopted after completing the “Hajj” pilgrimage to Mecca and converting to Sunni Islam.
 Museum on the horizon

Also in 2024, the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation officially was awarded a $20 million grant from the state to create a museum devoted to its namesake near 35th and Evans Street, a site where Malcolm X first lived with his family. The funds followed through on legislation, approved the previous year, to build the cultural center supporters foresee as a tourist destination.
Originally, the foundation had requested funding through a competitive process set up to dole out economic development grants to North and South Omaha from the state’s federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The museum was not among recommendations by a consultant, however. Amended legislation led by State Sens. Justin Wayne and McKinney carved out funds for the project.
As planned, the public dollars are set to build the museum, which is an anchor of a broader vision to transform the 17-acre campus that marks Malcolm X’s early childhood home.

Construction has yet to launch, but LeFlore-Ejike says planning is “moving along” with a review ongoing of requests that have been submitted for the master site plan development.
LeFlore-Ejike became executive director of the foundation in 2022, taking over work initiated in 1971 by Rowena Moore.
She said efforts to transform the still largely undeveloped area, which has gardens and a visitors center, has had “ebbs and flows.”
LeFlore-Ejike recalled the moment in 2010. She was a volunteer still in school, and the foundation had a grant for “visioning” work after having just purchased the existing visitor’s center, which was the former home of a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation. She recalled disappointment in the lackluster support to continue building momentum.
Now, she said, “We’re finally in a season of harvest.”
Citing LeFlore-Ejike’s work with the foundation, USA Today named her a nominee for its Women of the Year program in 2025. The selection recognizes “heroines” across the country who break barriers, push for change and make communities better.
LeFlore-Ejike hopes Malcolm X supporters are proud that decades of volunteer work “has not been in vain.”
 History-making

Ewing commended the state for recognizing a significant Nebraska native “very worthy” of hall of fame status.
Malcolm X’s 100th birthday observance comes as Ewing also celebrates a historical win in Nebraska’s largest city. In last Tuesday’s election, he soundly defeated three-term Mayor Jean Stothert.
“It all goes to show how far we’ve come as a community when it comes to being inclusive and accepting of leaders in our community,” he said.
Ewing said leaders “come in all shapes and sizes and backgrounds.”

(Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer)Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, threw the first stone on Monday morning, telling reporters that the Legislature wasn’t close to finishing its work on the last day of the legislative session because House Republicans were demanding ever more concessions, in violation of a global agreement reached last week.
“My mouth is full of cuss words right now,” Murphy said.
House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, blamed House Democrats, who refused to show up for the first few weeks of session so Republicans couldn’t use their temporary, 1-vote advantage to block a Democrat from being seated in a hotly contested election.
“Waiting 23 days of a stall out was not helpful,” Demuth said.
The blame game was in full force on Monday as it became apparent that lawmakers might not even stay at the Capitol until midnight, an unofficial tradition on the constitutionally mandated last day of the session, because there’d be no budget bills ready to debate.
“I think we’ll run out of things to do this evening,” said House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park.
The Legislature has only passed seven, mostly noncontroversial bills out of some 20 bills in process, with the biggest pieces of legislation still outstanding, including the budgets for education, taxes, and health and human services.
There haven’t even been legislators assigned to hammer out agreements between the House and Senate in what are known as conference committees — a blend of representatives and senators of both parties — on education finance and taxes. Education alone comprises roughly 40% of the general fund budget.
Lawmakers must pass a budget by June 30, or the government shuts down.
Walz and lawmakers hope they can keep working on compromises on the most contentious issues and get to final deals, which would set the parameters for a quick special session, ideally before the Memorial Day holiday. Only Gov. Tim Walz can call a special session, but only lawmakers can adjourn once they’re in a special session.
While the governor and legislative leaders announced a global budget agreement last week, what exactly it entailed now seems to be up for debate. The governor and legislative leaders only released a single page with budget targets for state agencies, but no written record of their agreements on policy.
Leaders said paid family leave would remain unchanged except for a 0.1% reduction in the cap on payroll taxes. Now, deeper cuts are back on the table.
“There is bipartisan desire to make additional changes to paid family medical leave before it even rolls out. That was not part of the global agreement,” Demuth said, noting support from DFL Sen. Judy Seeberger for cuts to the program set to launch next year.
Hortman said on Monday that the agreement included no additional changes to paid family leave and expects Demuth “to honor her word.”
Senate Minority Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, reiterated to reporters that he never signed the global budget agreement on behalf of his caucus.
“We’re not subject or held to that agreement,” Johnson said. “We are going to fight to the very end.”
Progressive Democrats seemed to have backed down from threatening to hold up budget bills over rolling back access to MinnesotaCare for undocumented immigrant adults, which was part of the global agreement.
Rep. Cedrick Frazier, DFL-New Hope, said on Saturday that the People of Color and Indigenous Caucus and their allies don’t plan to shut down government over that bill.
With so much left to do and the Legislature no longer officially in session as of midnight, the negotiations will happen mostly outside of the public’s eye in “working groups.”
Asked if the public would be able to watch the working groups debate the state’s next two year budget, Murphy said she was “very interested” in them working in public if she could get agreement from the other body.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_6100-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

It seemed like it might never happen, but we now know the winner of last November’s election for an associate justice seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Following federal Judge Richard Myers’ complete rejection of GOP candidate Jefferson Griffin’s effort to overturn his narrow defeat by tossing the ballots of thousands of voters, Griffin finally conceded and earlier this past week, incumbent Democratic Justice Allison Riggs was sworn in to serve a new and full eight-year term (albeit six months late).
And recently, Newsline’s Rob Schofield caught up with one of our state’s top government watchdogs, Common Cause of North Carolina executive director Bob Phillips – both to discuss this long-awaited news as well as some dramatic and deeply worrisome changes taking place at the state Board of Elections.

Free.,"U.S. Supreme Court lets Trump end protected status for 350,000 Venezuelan migrants",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-lets-trump-end-protected-status-350000-venezuelan-migrants,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Monday will allow, for now, the Trump administration to terminate temporary protections for a group of 350,000 Venezuelans, striking down a lower court’s order that blocked the process.The order still means the group of Venezuelans on Temporary Protected Status — a designation given to nationals from countries deemed too dangerous to return to remain in the U.S. — will be able to continue to challenge in court the end of their work permits and the possibility of removal. But they no longer have protections from deportation. No justices signed onto the ruling, which is typical in cases brought before the high court on an emergency basis, but liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted she would have denied the request.TPS status for that group of Venezuelans — a portion of Venezuelans living in the United States, not all of them — was set to end on April 7 under a move by the Trump administration.But U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of the Northern District of California in March blocked Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s decision to vacate an extension of TPS protections that had been put in place by the Biden administration until October 2026.The case is now before the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.Chen, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, blocked the Trump administration from removing protections for that group of Venezuelans on the basis that Noem’s actions were “arbitrary and capricious,” and potentially motivated by racism.“Acting on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,” Chen wrote in his order.Noem cited gang activity as her reason for not extending TPS for the group of 350,000 Venezuelans, who came to the United States in 2023.A second group of 250,000 Venezuelans who were granted TPS in 2021 will have their work and deportation protections expire in September. Chen’s order did not apply to the second group of Venezuelans.Those with TPS have deportation protections and are allowed to work and live in the United States for 18 months, unless extended by the DHS secretary.Democrats criticized Monday’s decision, including Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet.“Ending protections for Venezuelans fleeing Maduro’s regime is cruel, short-sighted, and destabilizing,” he wrote on social media.Rep. Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington state, wrote on social media that Venezuelans “face extreme oppression, arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings, and torture — the exact type of situation that requires our government to provide TPS.”Monday’s order is one of several immigration-related emergency requests from the Trump administration before the Supreme Court.Last week, the high court heard oral arguments that stemmed from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship.And justices in a separate case, again, denied the Trump administration from resuming the deportations of Venezuelans under an 18th-century wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act.",,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

(Photo courtesy of Sony Electronics)Insurance companies doing business in Montana won’t have to provide coverage for hearing aids after Gov. Greg Gianforte vetoed House Bill 607 earlier this month.
State law currently requires insurance companies to cover hearing aids for individuals 18 years and younger. HB 607, brought by Rep. Paul Tuss, D-Havre, would have extended that to all ages. According to a fiscal note attached to a bill, the state estimates the average hearing aid to cost $5,000. 
In the same note, it said the average number of ears requiring hearing aids is 1.37, meaning a fair number of people require two.
“Typically, insurance will cover the diagnoses for hearing loss. But after that, you’re on your own,” Tuss said in a Monday press release. “By age 75, nearly half of Americans experience hearing loss. The cost of treatment can be a major burden on people’s finances— especially those living on fixed incomes. It causes people to put off getting hearing aids and try to get by with reduced hearing.”
In his veto letter, Gov. Greg Gianforte called the bill an “unfunded insurance mandate” that would cost Montana taxpayers $3.5 million. He added that it would need “increased contributions” from the state’s roughly 30,000 public employees.
“Our administration is proud of our work with the Legislature to lower healthcare costs and expand access for Montanans through conservative, free-market principles, not government mandates,” Gianforte wrote in the letter, dated May 2. “Our conservative, free-market approach stands in stark contrast to the approach of states that embrace costly government rules, regulations, and mandates that distort markets, limit consumer choice, and inflate health care costs.”
The day before the veto, Gianforte received a letter from Misty Ann Giles, the director of the state Department of Administration, urging him to veto the bill. In the letter, Giles said the legislation would cost the state between $500,000 to $600,000 annually, which is in line with the bill’s fiscal note.
“During negotiations with employees, there was no indication that hearing aid coverage was a needed benefit, and no funding was included in the state’s budget or HB 13 to pay for providing that additional benefit,” Giles wrote in the letter. “Although the additional cost of the expanded hearing aid mandate was noted in the fiscal note for HB 607, no appropriation was included to offset the expense.”
Insurance legislation was a priority for Democrats during the session, including laws looking to regulate where the tech industry and medical insurance industry collide.
Democratic leadership slammed the veto.
“Under the Hearing Aid Coverage Act, thousands of Montanans would have finally been able to afford to get their hearing back,” House Minority leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula said in a release. “But today, the Governor chose insurance companies over Montanans. Our multi-millionaire Governor does not know what it’s like to choose between getting healthcare and putting food on the table or filling up your tank with gas.”

In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have acquired hundreds of smaller providers of disability services around the country and rolled them into larger corporations (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images).Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.
But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

The Marine Draftsmen’s Association-United Auto Workers of America, Local 571, essentially the workers responsible for designing the U.S. Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet, had threatened to strike earlier this month if the company did not make greater wage and benefit concessions.
The local’s negotiating committee announced the tentative contract agreement late Sunday, saying it contains “unprecedented” wage increases of more than 30% over the five-year term as well as increased retirement security. The deal now goes up for a vote by union members. Union officials did not say when the vote would be.
“We’ve been saying it all along: The company didn’t want a work stoppage, we did not want a work stoppage,” William Louis, president of Local 571, said in a video posted on union social media sites Sunday night. “And as we’ve been telling you for a long time, we have been working endlessly to get to the table with the company and have something put together that we both agree on.”
Electric Boat, a subsidiary of Reston, Va.-based General Dynamics, was recently awarded a contract worth more than $12.4 billion by the Navy for the construction of two Virginia-class submarines. The funding also covers improved pay for workers including the Marine Draftsmen’s Association.
“This package recognizes the essential role of the MDA members in the production of submarines for the U.S. Navy,” Electric Boat said in a joint statement with the union.
The union’s contract expired April 4, but leadership had agreed to continue bargaining with EB.
Electric Boat employs more than 23,000 people at his shipyard in Groton, engineering facilities in New London and operations in Quonset Point, Rhode Island.
The company said its earlier offer included a 23.3% general wage increase over the life of the contract, plus benefits and an increased retirement package.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25108024078154-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 16:08:08.932118

Kevin Stitt announced that a $4 billion aluminum smelting facility is coming to the Port of Inola in Northeast Oklahoma.

Kevin Stitt, right, sign a memorandum of understanding on April 21. (Photo provided by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce)Gov. Kevin Stitt announced that a $4 billion aluminum smelting facility is coming to the Port of Inola in Northeast Oklahoma. The governor penned a deal with Emirates Global Aluminium as part of a larger slate of deals with the United Arab Emirates announced by the Trump Administration on Thursday.


“Thanks to our pro-business environment, Oklahoma is quickly becoming the critical minerals headquarters of the United States,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday evening.
According to the memorandum of understanding Stitt signed in April with the company’s chief executive officer, that pro-business environment consists of more than $275 million in incentives from the state, plus another expected $735 million in tax exemptions and offsets. The state is loaning the company more than half a billion dollars in tax increment financing.
The Legislature still needs to approve that memorandum of understanding, but House Speaker Kyle Hilbert and Senate Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton expressed support.
“Oklahoma’s selection as the preferred site for the first new primary aluminum production plant built in the United States in nearly half a century is a landmark achievement for our state,” Paxton said in a statement.
The agreement is part of $200 billion in commercial agreements between the United States and the United Arab Emirates expected to be unveiled by President Donald Trump and the White House, according to the Oklahoma Department of Commerce.
“Oklahoma proudly stands with President Trump in the mission to bring manufacturing back to American soil,” Hilbert said in the same press release.
Stitt said the newly announced aluminum smelter will bring 1,000 direct jobs and 1,800 indirect jobs to Oklahoma.
But in addition to creating jobs, aluminum smelting generates harmful byproducts. Every ton of aluminum produced creates at least 2 tons of solid waste, which can include caustic, toxic and radioactive materials, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The Inola facility is expected to produce around 600,000 tons of aluminum each year.
The Port of Inola is a vision of the Tulsa Ports, which acquired 2,200 acres of land on the Verdigris River in 2019. The port’s industrial park is currently home to a paper mill and a proposed $1 billion solar panel factory, which was initially projected to start manufacturing and create 1,000 jobs by 2025. After Stitt touted it as the largest economic development project in state history, the solar panel manufacturing plant has been on hold for a year and a half.
Now, the aluminum smelter has topped the solar panel factory in terms of promised economic impact.
“We are proud to welcome Emirates Global Aluminium to our state and excited for the generational impact this investment will have on our future,” Stitt said. “As President Donald Trump looks to onshore our nation’s supply chain for critical minerals, Oklahoma is leading the way in this sector.”
Oklahoma has attracted several mineral refining plants over the past five years. A lithium refinery broke ground in Muskogee in January. Plans for a nickel refinery are facing pushback in Lawton. After being announced in 2022, a Stillwater plant that processes rare earth metals produced its first “neo magnets” earlier this year.

(Tero Vesalainen / Getty Images)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez recently signed onto a letter backed by 39 other attorneys general opposing efforts by U.S. House Republicans to restrict states for the next decade from passing laws related to artificial intelligence.
“Artificial Intelligence will be the most impactful technology of our generation and states must have the ability to shepherd its progress in a safe and responsible way,” Torrez said in a statement. “While Congress has failed to act, we’ve worked hard to develop new proposals—like House Bill 401—which would have penalized the use of AI-generated content for harassment, extortion, or defamation, and created tools to detect harmful synthetic media and unmask bad actors. Though it didn’t pass, strong state-level protections are still urgently needed, and states must have the flexibility to regulate this emerging technology if Congress refuses to act.”
Republicans added the clause restricting states’ laws on AI to the U.S. House budget bill congressional they hope to pass before Memorial Day. The measure, advanced on May 14, as part of the House Energy & Commerce Committee’s budget reconciliation proposal. Exceptions to the state ban would include laws that “remove legal impediments to, or facilitate the deployment or operation of” AI systems.
In their letter, the AGs write that the “promise of AI raises exciting and important possibilities. But, like any emerging technology, there are risks to adoption without responsible, appropriate, and thoughtful oversight.

(Photo courtesy of Bureau of Reclamation)Grand Coulee Dam is among the most powerful energy-generating dams on earth. It’s the bedrock of the federal Columbia River Power System — a network of 31 dams supplying more than half of the hydropower in the Northwest. Grand Coulee alone, overseen by the federal Bureau of Reclamation, generates one-quarter of that.
Drought in the West has cost hydropower industry billions in losses in two decades, analysis finds

But critical operations at the dam are going understaffed following President Donald Trump’s orders, executed by the Office of Personnel Management, to cut probationary federal employees, freeze new hiring at federal agencies and offer incentives to get employees to retire and resign early. It’s a problem at several agencies that oversee the system, which have lost hundreds of employees and could collectively lose hundreds more by fall, and it has regional electric utilities concerned about the safety, reliability and future of the region’s power transmission.
“These are not D.C. policy-maker jobs. These are jobs on the ground, serving the people of the Pacific Northwest with clean, reliable power,” said Scott Simms, president of the Public Power Council. The nonprofit industry group represents consumer-owned utilities in six states, all of which rely on power from the Columbia River dams.
“It actually takes quite a few human beings to run these giant hydro projects on a daily basis,” Simms said. “So that is the prevailing concern in the short term: making sure that the right people are in certain jobs, and also that there’s coverage, because these are 24/7 jobs.”
 Hundreds of BPA, Bureau of Reclamation, Army Corps of Engineers employees gone

The Bureau is not the only player in the basin’s energy delivery system that’s suffering. The Army Corps of Engineers, which also manages the dams, could lose more than 300 employees in the next few months, according to Tom Conning, public information officer for the Corps’ Northwestern Division. Employees of the branch had until May 1 to accept a deferred resignation and be put on paid administrative leave and have until Sept. 30 to officially resign.
The Bonneville Power Administration, or BPA, which markets and delivers the dams’ hydropower across the region, has lost 200 employees, according to recent testimony from U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright at a May 7 House Committee on Appropriations budget hearing.
Cuts have cost the Bureau of Reclamation about 25% of its staff so far — around 1,400 people — according to reporting in Politico, and staffing levels at Grand Coulee Dam are about 70% of what they should be, according to Simms.
“We understand they were behind in being fully staffed as it was, and then the workforce reductions came into play,” he said of Grand Coulee.
Bureau officials did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s request to either confirm or correct the figures.
“While we do not comment on personnel matters, we are committed to enhancing workforce management and are collaborating closely with the Office of Personnel Management to embrace new opportunities for optimization and innovation,” Michael Coffey, a regional public affairs officer at the Department of the Interior, said in an email.
Trump’s orders, meant to cut federal spending, have not had any impact. Analyses by the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and CBS News found the Treasury’s daily spending is up billions from the same period last year.
When it comes to BPA, staff who’ve been offered incentives to resign and retire won’t make any difference. Their salaries are not taxpayer funded, but ratepayer funded, and the agency sends a profit each year to the U.S. Treasury.
Simms said 90 more BPA jobs had been rescinded as part of the federal hiring freeze, a number confirmed by a source familiar with BPA. The agency initially lost more than 100 probationary employees under a Trump executive order in February, but has since been able to bring them back.
The 290 job losses at BPA so far account for nearly 10% of the agency’s staff, and the agency is already hundreds of employees short, according to Energy Secretary Wright’s testimony.

 Agencies work hand-in-hand to maintain, manage Columbia River Power System

All three agencies — Reclamation, Corps and BPA — collaborate to maintain and manage the Columbia River Power System.
“So they work hand-in-hand. If you don’t have reliable hydro projects, then you don’t have a stable, workable grid, right?” Simms said. “There’s craftspeople, there’s welders, there’s electricians, there’s all kinds of folks who are involved in the operation of any dam.”
The Corps is also grappling with the possibility of losing at least 325 employees in the next few months, according to Conning. That’s mostly due to resignations and early retirements.
“These reductions cut across all aspects of our operations, from senior managers, administration staff, park rangers, maintenance workers, etc.,” he said in an email. “Additionally, existing vacancies are complicating our ability to fully support various missions (like recreation).
Corps’ districts in Portland, Seattle and Walla Walla, Washington, have temporarily limited or closed some recreation areas to maintain public safety and services, he added.
Simms said the long-term concern for all of these agencies in the Northwest is not funding but having employees with the skills to preserve and improve the system. BPA and the agencies are years behind in the region as far as investing in grid expansion and connecting to new green energy projects, reporting from Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica recently found.
Simms likened the predictable outcome to that of deferring maintenance on your car.
“Essentially your car is due for service and you just continue to ignore the warning light. You’re going to pay the consequences if you continue to ignore that warning light,” he said. “That is what we’re worried about in the longer term: making sure that we’ve got the right people to do the needed work. It’s not a money problem, it’s actually a people problem.”
Simms said the Public Power Council has been working with both sides of the aisle in both chambers of Congress to advocate for more investment in the region’s hydropower system and its employees.
At the May 7 Congressional budget hearing, Energy Secretary Wright said he was aware BPA’s staffing could not go lower.
“I don’t think we have room to reduce headcount there anymore,” he said. “There’ll be no more shrinkage in head count at Bonneville Power.”
Simms said federal leaders likely need to go further.
“I think we’re going to have to get our heads around the idea of probably paying incentive payments and retention payments the way we’ve seen at the FAA for air traffic controllers, the way we’ve seen it for the USDA for food inspectors, the way we’ve seen it at the Forest Service for fire mitigation personnel,” he said. “I think we’re going to be in a place where we’re going to have to use those kinds of tools to attract and retain the people that we need for these critical positions.”

Lawmakers in Raleigh recently concluded crossover week – a chaotic period in which they considered and voted on scores of bills in dozens of important subject areas in just a few days. And for better or worse, a lot of important and controversial measures won approval and remain eligible for final passage this session.
So, what passed? What failed? And what’s on the agenda going forward? Newsline’s Rob Schofield recently sat down with reporter Galen Bacharier, to find out. And as Galen told Rob, while the state budget debate is sure to be the chief focus of lawmakers going forward, several other high-profile topics – from culture war issues like “diversity, equity and inclusion” and gun control to the role of the state Auditor – will also remain on the political front burner.

(Photo by Getty Images)After lawmakers couldn’t agree on which committee should handle her proposal to regulate forever chemicals in pesticides, Rep. Amy Arata is taking a new, more sweeping approach. 
The Republican from New Gloucester got approval from legislative leaders to introduce a late-session bill (LD 1982) that would change how perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, are defined in state law. She believes the current definition is overly broad and could include chemicals that don’t pose the same long-term health problems as PFAS, which have been linked to cancer and weakened immune systems. 
During a public hearing Monday, Arata introduced her proposal for Maine to adopt the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s narrower definition for PFAS, which was changed under the Biden administration. The proposal would narrow the definition from any fluorinated organic chemical containing at least one fully fluorinated carbon atom to substances containing any one of three specific chemical structures.
She told the Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources committee that her bipartisan proposal is “merely a refinement” of the existing definition.
Arata is largely concerned with farmers being unable to use certain pesticides that would fall under the state’s current definition. She said changing Maine’s definition to align with that federal definition would still “protect the health of Maine citizens while also allowing our farmers and other industries to be competitive nationwide.” 
However, Commissioner Melanie Loyzim said the Department of Environmental Protection opposes the bill because the state already has a process for people to seek exemptions to use products with PFAS that would otherwise be prohibited under the state ban that will be rolling out in the coming years. 
Under the state’s PFAS products ban, any product containing intentionally added PFAS can not be sold in the state after Jan. 1, 2030. The department’s website includes step-by-step instructions for requesting exemptions for certain products with currently unavoidable use. 
Rather than creating a more limited definition, Loyzim said uses of PFAS that are “economically important” but don’t pose health risks should be evaluated individually. 
Loyzim also argued that this change wouldn’t actually create uniformity with the federal guidelines because the EPA uses different definitions based on the specific regulation, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act versus the Toxic Substances Control Act. 
Arata said her bill would not precipitate other changes in Maine laws related to PFAS, but Loyzim said that definition is used in multiple areas of statute including those pertaining to wastewater discharge, land application of sewage, food packaging and more. 
Nancy McBrady, deputy commissioner for the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, acknowledged that farmers could be hurt by a prohibition on certain pesticides that would fall under the state’s PFAS products bans, but warned LD 1982 is too broad. 
Rather, she suggested the Legislature pursue a narrower discussion on PFAS and pesticides in the next session. However, that conversation would likely need to go before the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee. 
The Maine State Chamber of Commerce argues Arata’s proposal could create greater consistency and clarity for business, especially those who deal with national supply chains. The Maine Potato Board echoed this point when speaking in support of the bill. 
However, other environmental organizations including the Friends of Casco Bay, Defend Our Health and the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association opposed the bill.

(Chris Jackson | West Virginia Watch)A former lieutenant at the Southern Regional Jail in Raleigh County has been sentenced to 17 years in prison for covering up an assault that led to the death of inmate Quentez Burks in 2022. 
Burks died March 1, 2022, one day after the 37 year old was booked on charges of wanton endangerment and obstructing an officer. 
Chad Lester, 35, of Odd, West Virginia, was sentenced Thursday to 17 years, 6 months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release. A federal jury convicted him earlier this year of three felony obstruction of justice charges, including conspiracy to tamper with witnesses; witness tampering; and giving false statements. 
According to prosecutors, officers at the jail retaliated against Burks for trying to push past an officer by bringing him to spots that were not monitored by surveillance cameras and assaulting him. Seven officers pleaded guilty to charges in Burks’ death.
Officials say Lester threatened subordinate officers with violence and retaliation, added false statements to multiple officers’ reports, instructed officers to give a false cover story to investigators, and personally gave false statements to internal investigators. He also lied about the assault during a voluntary interview with FBI agents.
“This defendant wrongfully decided to obstruct an investigation into a fatal assault of an inmate,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a news release. “I am proud of the Criminal Section within the Civil Rights Division and their counterparts in the Southern District of West Virginia for their work on this case.”
“On the defendant’s watch, correctional officers killed an inmate, and the defendant conspired with them to cover up their crimes,” Acting United States Attorney Lisa G. Johnston said in a news release. “The defendant violated the public’s trust in the law enforcement system he had sworn to uphold.”

Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, speaks at an announcement of a budget deal for the 2026 fiscal year on May 14. (Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A House budget committee on Monday voted to move forward with spending $312 million to purchase a private prison in Lawton that the state uses to house about 2,300 inmates.
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, said The GEO Group, which operates the Lawton Correctional and Rehabilitation Facility in south Comanche County, no longer wants to continue its business relationship with the state. 
Caldwell, who chairs the House’s appropriations committee and authored House Bill 2780, said legislators have made “multiple overtures” to the company to avoid having to purchase the prison, which included offering increases in the amount the state pays in per diem rates to care for inmates. 
“The company has stood steadfast now going back to January that they do not want to continue their business relationship with the state of Oklahoma,” Caldwell said.
He said Gov. Kevin Stitt’s office also requested the state purchase the prison.
Caldwell said last year, lawmakers passed a per diem increase to keep up with cost of living increases, but it was vetoed by Stitt. At the time, Stitt wrote in his veto message that he rejected the $3 million increase because he did not want to put taxpayers on the hook for increasing salaries of private corporations that have state contracts. 
The GEO Group responded to the veto by announcing it was abruptly ending its contract with the state. The Department of Corrections, which at the time had over 2,600 inmates in the prison, responded, alleging that the Lawton facility was the “most violent prison” in the state and lacked “the standard of care expected.” Around the same time, two inmates were killed and 30 others were injured during a fight. 
The Department of Corrections and The GEO Group ultimately agreed to a one-year contract extension.
Caldwell said both The GEO Group and the Department of Corrections have had legitimate frustrations.
He said the Department of Corrections has been concerned about inmate safety and violence in the facility, and The GEO Group had concerns that the state agency was incorrectly reclassifying inmates to make sure they qualified for incarceration in Lawton.
“I think that in the past there are things that both sides could point to and say that they’ve done wrong,” Caldwell said. “I think our job as a Legislature is looking at problems and trying to find solutions going forward. That’s what this piece of legislation does. It gets Oklahoma out of the private prison business.”
The Lawton facility is the state’s last privately operated prison, though the state leases and runs one other that is owned by a private entity.
The $312 million purchase is an “all-in price.” He said in the past, the state has purchased private prisons where the company took everything within the parameters of the prison with them, which made it very hard to immediately take control. This time, the contract includes vehicles, refrigerators, furniture, utensils, security cameras, the computer system and the warden’s house. It also includes private acreage next to the facility.
He said estimates show it would cost the state between $1.3 billion and $2 billion to build a similar facility.
The prison employs about 450 people, and every employee will be offered employment with pay that is at least equal to what they’re receiving now as well as state benefits, Caldwell said. The Department of Corrections will continue to be allocated the $47 million appropriation that The GEO Group had received, but the agency instead will use it to maintain and pay those employees.
Caldwell said the state has excess capacity to house minimum security inmates, but it doesn’t have the same space availability to incarcerate offenders classified as medium security or who must be in protective custody. 
Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, said lawmakers did not intend to purchase a prison from a strategy perspective, and questioned if all efforts had been made to reconcile the differences between The GEO Group and the state’s executive branch “at a time when we could be investing in other things that are of greater value.” 
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, who cast the sole dissenting vote against the purchase, said he had hoped this purchase would open up some additional capacity to help address issues with Oklahoma’s aging prison infrastructure. He was told it would not.
“I was hoping to hear that we might have some capacity that we could shut down someplace else,” he said. “We have a number of prisons that are desperately in need of renovation, ancient, and those are places, frankly, oftentimes our DOC folks are not safe,” he said.
The measure, which passed by a 27-1 vote, next heads to the full House for consideration.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In the wake of guilty verdicts in Tennessee’s political corruption trial, House Republicans are lauding Speaker Cameron Sexton for alerting federal authorities to a secret political vendor and cooperating with them to get a conviction.
The House Republican Caucus released a statement immediately after the case’s outcome saying the guilty verdict for former Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-aide Cade Cothren “reaffirms the principle that public office is a sacred trust, not a license for personal gain or abuse of power.”
The jury found Casada guilty on 17 of 19 counts of fraud, kickbacks, bribery, money laundering and conspiracy and Cothren guilty on all 19 counts. Former Rep. Robin Smith pleaded guilty in the case and testified against the pair.
The caucus said it appreciates Sexton’s leadership as he was “instrumental in uncovering illegal activity by two former members and providing critical facts to federal authorities.”
The statement adds that Sexton’s “commitment to integrity in state government reflects the standards to which all public officials should be held.”
Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, ex-aide, guilty in federal corruption case

Sexton, a Crossville Republican, was expected to testify for the prosecution but was never called to the stand in the four-week trial. 
Casada’s defense attorney, Ed Yarbrough, said the absence of Sexton testimony left a hole in the prosecution’s argument. Yet the defense called no witnesses to testify, including Sexton, despite issuing subpoenas to him and numerous people.
Cothren and his defense team went after Sexton before the trial started, making the claim that he or one of his staff members wore a device to record conversations with lawmakers. In addition, Cothren said he helped Sexton win the House Speaker’s race in 2019 after Casada resigned the post, then fell out of favor.
Phoenix Solutions, the secretive company run by Cothren in cahoots with Casada and Smith, tapped into House members’ postage and printing money for constituent mailers. The trio had to keep Cothren’s role quiet because of his 2019 resignation from the chief of staff post in a racist and sexist texting scandal.
Phoenix Solutions ran into trouble getting paid by the Legislative Administration office run by Connie Ridley. As questions arose about the vendor, Cothren signed a W-9 form as “Matthew Phoenix,” a bogus name for the company’s president, one of the linchpins for the government’s case.
When FBI agents raided Casada’s home in January 2021, he ultimately told them that Cothren couldn’t “deal” with lawmakers or be known as running Phoenix Solutions because Sexton didn’t like him.

CLARKSDALE – J’s Grocery opened its doors in Clarksdale on May 2, marking a turning point for a community lacking access to fresh produce. Located in the Eastgate neighborhood, a historically underserved area, the store brings not only convenience but also a vital resource for those facing food insecurity.

Tyler Yarbrough, a local advocate and director of Mississippi Delta programs at Partnership for a Healthier America, has deep personal ties to the neighborhood. He grew up just a few blocks away in Eastgate, where he witnessed firsthand the struggles families faced in accessing fresh food. 
“I grew up in this neighborhood, and it was difficult to find healthy food options,” Yarbrough said. “I’m proud to be part of this effort to bring a neighborhood corner store back to life, where residents can walk a few steps and find fresh produce.”
Before the opening of J’s Grocery, many neighborhood stores had closed, and those still open primarily offered shelf-stable snacks. Yarbrough, along with partners, have worked to revitalize this corner of Clarksdale by reconnecting the community with local farmers and providing fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. 
“This isn’t just about food; it’s about connecting people to their roots and building a healthier future,” Yarbrough said.

The Jones family has served the Clarksdale community for over 27 years by providing essential groceries and community services, including a laundromat and barber shop. After J’s Grocery closed for several years, the family took the lead in its recent reopening, working closely with local advocates and organizations — such as Yarbrough’s Partnership for a Healthier America and the nonprofit Rootswell — to renovate the space and refocus the store on fresh, healthy food options. This collaboration reflects their commitment to continuing the family’s legacy of service while addressing food insecurity in the neighborhood. 
“We want to give the community a better way to eat,” said Alshun Jones, the son of store owner Al Jones.  “It’s about supporting the neighborhood and providing healthy options that have been missing for so long.”

Store owner Al Jones expressed his gratitude for the support and partnerships that made the store’s opening possible. “This is just the beginning,” Al said. “We want to see more stores like this across the city, helping communities thrive.”
The store’s reopening also signals the beginning of a larger community revitalization effort, which includes plans for murals and safer sidewalks to connect the store to the nearby schools and residences.
With its focus on fresh food, community involvement, and local partnerships, J’s Grocery is more than just a store — it’s a beacon of hope for the Eastgate neighborhood, offering a fresh start for residents and a model for revitalizing food access in rural communities.

People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”

 According to the report, two of the top 10 largest private-equity owned developmental disabilities care providers operate in New Mexico: Team Services Group / Team Public Choices, owned by Alpine Investors; and Sevita, owned by Centerbridge Partners, Vistria Group.

For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.




States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
Vets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

For nearly three decades, a pair of nonprofits – the North Carolina Institute of Medicine and NC Child – have released a biennial study known as the Child Health Report Card. The goal, as you might expect, is to provide legislators, public health officials, school administrators, parents and other nonprofit leaders with the latest information on the health and well-being of our state’s kids.
This year – as in 2023 – the focus of the report is on the mental health struggles that plague so many children and the urgent need for better (and better funded) public responses. And recently, to learn more about this issue and several others detailed in the report, NC Newsline caught up with the leaders of the two organizations – Institute of Medicine President and CEO Michelle Ries and NC Child executive director, Erica Palmer Smith.

Glenn Youngkin speaks at an event where he rolled out his amendments to the state budget in March. (Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s general fund revenues rose sharply in April, bucking signs of a national economic cooldown as the state continues to post steady long-time job growth and rake in more tax dollars than projected.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Monday that general fund revenues are up 6.3% — nearly $1.5 billion — compared to the same 10-month period last fiscal year. April alone brought in $322.4 million more than the same month in 2024, marking an 8.8% jump. Overall, revenues are tracking 0.8% — or $211.1 million — ahead of the state’s official forecast, with two months left in the fiscal year.
“Virginia’s financials remain strong, reflecting strong job growth and business investment,” Youngkin said in a statement. “With over 265,000 more Virginians working today versus three years ago and over $100 billion in capital investment commitments from companies eager to grow in Virginia, the Commonwealth’s financial performance is tracking ahead of forecast.”
The upbeat state report comes even as the national economy posted a notable dip in growth. According to a memo from Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings to the governor, real U.S. GDP growth fell sharply in the first quarter of 2025. 
The decline was largely driven by a surge in imports, as consumers rushed to beat expected tariffs. Imports grew at a 9% annual rate, while the rest of the economy posted a more modest 2% pace.
Despite the GDP slide, hiring remained solid. The U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, and Virginia tacked on 5,900 jobs in March — the most recent month with available data — led by construction, health care and transportation. The state’s unemployment rate nudged up slightly to 3.2% in March, up from 3.1 percent the previous month.
Still, federal employment is showing cracks. Virginia lost an estimated 4,100 federal jobs in March, while nationally the federal government shed 9,000 jobs in April — figures that state officials say bear watching.
“Strong revenue results for April, a significant collection month, indicate that the Virginia economy continues to exceed our prudent forecast,” Cummings said in a statement. “While we continue to have confidence in our FY2025 forecast and the long-term resiliency and strength of the Virginia economy, we are cognizant of potential short-term risks associated with federal job reductions and the resetting of trade relationships.”
Cummings added that the governor’s final budget decisions reflect a “prudent and responsible plan on behalf of our taxpayers to provide additional cushion for the commonwealth’s general fund resources.”
Meanwhile, inflation cooled slightly in April. Consumer prices rose 2.3% compared to last year, down from 2.4% in March and well below the 3.3% rate seen a year ago. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, held steady at 2.8%. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge also fell, with the core personal consumption expenditures index easing to 2.6% in March.
The Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged earlier this month and is expected to do so again at its June 18 meeting.

State wildlife agencies have a big job.
While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”




There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges.

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

(Photo by Hadley Barndollar/New Hampshire Bulletin)Helen Hanks is stepping down from her role as New Hampshire Department of Corrections commissioner, Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s office announced Monday.
The announcement comes amid deep staffing shortages within the department, which have led to increased overtime pay as workers cover shifts left open by vacancies. Hanks told the Bulletin in June her department was facing a $3.44 million deficit caused in large part by these overtime payouts. The department said at the time that 46% of its positions were vacant.
In April, amid the state budgeting process, Hanks made an impassioned plea to state senators to reverse budget cuts and staff layoffs that the House implemented in their budget proposal. The majority of those layoffs affected civilian staff, not sworn officers. The Senate is still working through the budget and will have to pass its version of the budget, hash out any differences with the House, and have the governor approve it before the start of next fiscal year in July. In her plea, Hanks argued that these cuts would result in more offenders committing new crimes after leaving prison due to reduced rehabilitation and treatment programs; the department struggling to meet legal requirements; and maybe even the state being forced to call the New Hampshire National Guard for assistance.
Ayotte’s office said the governor would nominate John Scippa, director of New Hampshire Police Standards and Training, as acting commissioner while the state searches for Hanks’ replacement. The Executive Council will have to confirm Scippa before he can begin the role. The council’s next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday.
Hanks had been with the Department of Corrections since 2003, when she was hired as a social worker in the department’s Division of Medical and Forensic Services and assigned to the New Hampshire State Prison for Men. In 2005, she earned her first leadership role in the department when she was named deputy director of medical and forensic services. She slowly rose in the ranks of the department until 2017, when then-Gov. Chris Sununu appointed her commissioner. She was the first woman confirmed to the role.
Ayotte’s office also said Monday that Assistant Corrections Commissioner Paul Raymond has been placed on leave “effective immediately.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/IMG_8356-1-1024x537.jpg,,,2025-05-19 14:11:44.033873

(Photo by Nick Romanenko, courtesy of Rutgers University)A social scientist and mathematician who has helmed Louisiana State University since 2021 will be the next president of Rutgers University.
William F. Tate IV will replace Jonathan Holloway, whose rocky five-year tenure was marred by a deadly global pandemic, a faculty strike, student protests over Gaza, and most recently, growing hostility and cuts from the Trump administration.
Rutgers’ board of governors, with the consent of its trustees, unanimously approved Tate Monday morning to lead New Jersey’s 67,000-student flagship university and applauded his “leadership abilities, academic credentials, intelligence, and administrative skills.”
“Dr. Tate is (an) extraordinary leader, a scholar, an innovator, and a transformative force whose vision will unite academic excellence with public impact,” trustees chair Amy Mansue said at a joint meeting in New Brunswick.
He will start July 1, with an annual base salary of $1.1 million and opportunities to pad his pay considerably with performance incentives.
Gov. Phil Murphy was on hand Monday to welcome him to New Jersey.
“I was instantly and incredibly impressed,” Murphy said of Tate’s credentials. “As they say in the movies, ‘He had me at hello.’”
Tate was the first Black president of Louisiana State University, that state’s flagship school with more than 55,000 students.
He had a turbulent tenure there, stirring controversy for a recent hiring freeze and for his decisions to drop diversity, equity, and inclusion language and to disband a committee tasked with renaming campus buildings with problematic names. One such building is named after John M. Parker, a former Louisiana governor who participated in the 1891 lynching of 11 Italian immigrants in New Orleans, the largest mass lynching in U.S. history.
Tate leaves Louisiana as officials there debate whether to split his position into two jobs. Besides serving as the university’s chief executive and academic officer, he also holds faculty appointments in sociology, psychiatry and behavioral medicine, epidemiology, and population and public health.
Before Louisiana, he served for 18 years as dean of the graduate school at Washington University in St. Louis, followed by about a year as provost at the University of South Carolina. He’s a Chicago native and married father of two with degrees from Northern Illinois University, University of Texas, University of Maryland, and the Washington University School of Medicine.
He was selected by a 20-member committee tasked with replacing Holloway, who announced in September he would step down. Officials said the committee considered “hundreds” of candidates. Dory Devlin, a Rutgers spokeswoman, declined to identify other finalists.
Tate said he’s “ready” for Rutgers and New Jersey, citing his upbringing in Chicago’s Bronzeville, a historically Black neighborhood.
“There is a lot in common between the grit, resilience, and toughness required to negotiate Bronzeville and here in the great state of New Jersey. So I’m ready,” Tate said.
Tate saluted Holloway for his work in positioning Rutgers “at the edge of excellence,” noting the increasingly tough times for higher education administrators.
“If you took a presidency in 2020 and you ended in 2025 I would submit you those were the five hardest years to ever be a university president,” Tate said.

Tate will be the 22nd president of Rutgers, which at 258 years old is one of the oldest universities in the U.S.
Holloway, a U.S. historian, was Rutgers’ first Black president, earning over $1 million a year.
He will remain Rutgers’ president until June 30 and then take a sabbatical during the 2025-26 academic year for research projects before returning to Rutgers as a full-time faculty member.

Within President Donald Trump’s first days in office, immigration officials in Michigan were sounding alarm bells for how his administration’s overhaul of the nation’s immigration system would negatively impact communities and children, making families afraid to send their kids to school or go to the hospital if they need help.
Volunteer child advocates for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights provide stability and oversight for children while they’re in government custody and facing deportation, the center’s website says. Volunteers visit children once a week, attending court proceedings and other meetings with a child in order to advocate for their welfare.
Amongst the new administration’s immigration policies, which include cutting federal programs for non-citizens, halting refugee services and deporting tens of thousands of people, the administration has terminated legal services for migrant children in the country alone who face navigating the legal system.
In order to combat the gap in help children can access, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights is holding informational meetings on May 27 and June 2 about becoming a volunteer, ahead of volunteer training on June 28 and 29. The center said in a news release that individuals, aged 21 or older, from all professions and social backgrounds are welcome to apply to be a volunteer. The center is also looking for bilingual volunteers.

The latest evidence of the Republican Party’s growth in Florida is news announced on Monday that registered Republicans now outrank Democrats in Miami-Dade County, the most populous in Florida.
The latest voter rolls in the county now show 464,370 registered Republicans, or 34% of voters, 440,790 Democrats, or 32.27%. Independent and third-party voters together number 460,783, or 33.7%.
“This is a total repudiation of the Democrats’ failed agenda. Miami-Dade is no longer their safe haven — it’s the beating heart of the Republican revolution,” said Evan Power, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida, in a written statement.
“We’re the party of hardworking families, Hispanic patriots, and communities demanding safe streets, top-notch schools, and a booming economy. Miami-Dade proves the unstoppable momentum of the Republican message.”
Long a Democratic stronghold, the majority-Latino area has been trending more politically right over the past decade but continued to back Democrats at the top of the ticket until the past couple of election cycles.
Although Donald Trump has won the state of Florida in the past three presidential elections, Miami-Dade voters supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. But Biden’s 2020 win was by only 7 points, down from Clinton’s 29-point margin of victory in 2016.

Then, last fall, Trump won Miami-Dade County for the first time in a presidential election, defeating Kamala Harris there by 11 points, becoming the first Republican to win in Miami-Dade since George H.W. Bush over Michael Dukakis in 1988 (Trump won the state by 13 points).
Florida has seen a surge of Republican voters since the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Whereas Ron DeSantis narrowly defeated Democrat Andrew Gillum in the race for governor in 2018 in a vote so close it took a recount to sort out, he came back and defeated Democrat Charlie Crist by 19 points statewide in 2022.
DeSantis won Miami-Dade that year by 11 points. In 2018, he lost to Gillum by 21 points, according to the Miami Herald.
To see how quickly the tide has turned, one need only look back at 2018, when Florida Democrats enjoyed a more than 264,000-voter registration lead. The Republican Party of Florida in 2021 overtook the Democrats for the first time in the state, and their lead today stands at 1.29 million.
“A decade ago, Miami-Dade County was a deep blue county with hundreds of thousands more registered Democrats than Republicans,” DeSantis said on X on Monday morning. “Today, the county — with more than 2.8 million people — has a Republican voter registration advantage. Nobody would have predicted this ten years ago.”
“THE BEST IS YET TO COME,” said Southwest Republican U.S. Rep. and gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds.
“Miami-Dade County has completed its off-year voter roll maintenance, and this morning, it shed 172,747 voters from its active voters,” said Michael Pruser, director of data science with Decision Desk HQ.
“The change netted Republican voters more than 38,000 voters compared to Democrats, and the country has now flipped to Republican by registration,” he added.
This is the second large county to flip from blue to red this year in Florida. In January, Republican voters overtook Democrats in Hillsborough County, the third-most populous in Florida. Republicans now lead in 59 out of 67 counties in voter registration.

(Courtesy photo)The state agency that runs state courts on Monday morning named Esperanza Lucero as its first-ever behavioral health integration and reform administrator, the person tasked with implementing major parts of a new state law reforming New Mexico’s behavioral health system.
New Mexico this year enacted Senate Bill 3, which is meant to rebuild the state’s systems for addressing mental health challenges, including substance use disorder.
The law requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to divide the state into behavioral health regions, each of which will identify five behavioral health priorities over the next four years.
“I see the Judiciary as uniquely suited to providing the leadership to bring together local stakeholders and providers in a meaningful way,” Esperanza said in a statement.
Esperanza’s first task in her new position is to assess the initiatives already underway in New Mexico under what is called Sequential Intercept Mapping (SIM), Supreme Court Chief Justice David Thomson said in a statement.
SIM is a commonly used conceptual model developed in the early 2000s that outlines points of “intercept” where people with mental health or substance use disorders can receive treatment and support.
AOC completed mapping for Santa Fe County in January; for Rio Arriba County in December; and for the Eighth Judicial District in northeastern New Mexico in October, according to reports published on its website.
A mapping workshop for the Fourth Judicial District in Mora, San Miguel and Guadalupe counties is scheduled for June 10 and 11, and a workshop for Los Alamos County is scheduled for June 23 and 24.
By June 1, the state Health Care Authority’s Behavioral Health Services Division will provide AOC with behavioral health standards and service evaluation guidelines, and by the end of this year, the state’s Medicaid program will establish a group of licensing boards to help streamline mental health providers’ credentialing, according to a timeline presented by New Mexico’s top adult mental health services official earlier this month.
Lucero previously served as director of the state Department of Health’s Center for Health Protection, and led the Aging and Long-Term Services Department’s Adult Protective Services Division.
“Her experience working extensively with state and local agencies to implement policy, strategies and initiatives will help in laying the groundwork for behavioral health system improvements required by state law,” AOC Director Karl W. Reifsteck said in a statement.

State wildlife agencies have a big job.
While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.

Dollars

Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.

Mission

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”

Governance

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Saleena Gooch is suing Walgreens Pharmacy in U.S District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit alleges the Walgreens store at 2508 W. Broadway, Council Bluffs, hired Gooch in January 2019 as a shift lead and in 2020 transferred her the store’s pharmacy, where she worked as a customer service associate, pharmacy technician and pharmacy operations manager.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In July 2024, the lawsuit claims, Gooch was working in the store when the pharmacist on duty handed her a prescription order and instructed her to sell the medication to a waiting customer. Gooch allegedly followed the pharmacist’s directions, called out the name on the prescription order and the waiting customer responded.
She then asked the customer to verify, on a display screen, the telephone number associated with the order, to which the customer responded, “That is not my number.” Gooch reportedly asked the customer whether the displayed number could be an old phone number, and the customer indicated he didn’t think so, but then confirmed for Gooch the name of the medication included in the order.
Later in the day, another customer arrived and asked for the same prescription order Gooch had already sold, triggering an internal investigation as to what had transpired.
At some point after that incident, the lawsuit claims, Walgreens failed to review its proposed disciplinary action against Gooch in order to “take into consideration her diagnosis” of ADHD, and her employment was terminated.
According to the lawsuit, Gooch had previously been involved in other cases involving errors in dispensing medication. In October 2023, she had sold a prescription order, presumably to the wrong customer, in a situation where two different customers had the same first and last names.
In March 2024, a pharmacist instructed Gooch to ring up a prescription order despite the fact that the courier picking up the order was doing so for multiple customers and could not verify the customer information requested of him. It was later determined that one of the prescription orders was intended for a different individual.
A few weeks after that incident, in April 2024, Gooch sold a prescription order to another individual who was picking up multiple orders for different people. One prescription bag became stuck to another bag and was presumably sold despite a lack of verification as to that person’s identity.
It was after the incidents in March and April of 2024, the lawsuit alleges, that Walgreens management instructed Gooch to be tested for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, and she was later diagnosed with the disorder.
Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of state and federal laws prohibiting employers from discriminating against an individual on the basis of a physical or mental disability, such as ADHD.
Walgreens has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.
State records indicate Gooch’s pharmacy technician license is in good standing with the Iowa Board of Pharmacy, with no history of public disciplinary action.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis) North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is asking state lawmakers to approve $891 million in new relief for Hurricane Helene, signaling Monday that federal aid was continuing to dwindle and would not meet the needs of the western mountains.
Stein’s request — his second for hurricane aid since taking office in January — asks the General Assembly to infuse more than a quarter of a billion dollars into the western economy, including long-requested forgivable loans and grants for businesses. And it outlines investments to rebuild infrastructure, improve long-term housing and prepare for regional wildfires.
The state money will be especially crucial, the governor wrote, with pledged aid from the federal government “slow and uncertain.”
“I will continue to advocate for western North Carolina to our federal partners,” Stein wrote. “However, we suspect the burden will fall increasingly on state and local organizations.”
The legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, is unlikely to follow Stein’s request to the letter. But lawmakers have pledged to continue allocating aid, albeit with a more conservative approach. Helene aid will likely be considered as a separate bill from the larger state budget.



Stein asks for $891 million. Here are the highlights.
The largest line-item in Stein’s request is $100 million for the state to continue earning reimbursement from the feds. And he’s asking for an additional $50 million to cover “projects that neither federal and state programs nor insurance will support.”
Among other provisions:

A combined $100 million would go toward aid for small businesses — $50 million for forgivable loans and $50 million for grants.
School districts without flood insurance would see $70 million for repairs.
$50 million would fund stream debris removal, stabilization and farm infrastructure repairs.
Local governments facing budget shortfalls would see $40 million for revenue replacement.
Efforts to prevent and fight wildfires would see a $37 million infusion.
Tourism promotion and business adaptation efforts would get $15 million.
A combined $40 million would fund utility, rental and mortgage assistance, as well as efforts to prevent homelessness.

The legislature has thus far allocated a total of $1.6 billion for Helene relief. Around $1.4 billion has been appropriated, and another $202 million has been marked for spending but not yet sent out the door. The state’s last aid package, passed in March with bipartisan approval, totaled $524 million.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-19 13:12:21.304938

As the busy Memorial Day travel season begins, Delaware officials are urging drivers and passengers to buckle up as part of the national “Click It or Ticket” campaign.
Running from May 19 to June 8, the campaign pairs public education with stepped-up enforcement in an effort to reduce traffic fatalities involving unrestrained occupants.
The Delaware Office of Highway Safety (OHS), in coordination with state and local law enforcement, is leading the initiative, which will feature high-visibility patrols targeting seat belt violations during both daytime and nighttime hours.
“Although Delaware has a high seatbelt usage rate, the number of unrestrained fatalities is alarming,” said Sharon Bryson, Director of the Office of Highway Safety. “It is important to ensure everyone in the vehicle is properly restrained before driving.”
READ: Surf fishing reservations required starting May 24 at Delaware state parks
Delaware’s seatbelt usage has hovered around 92% in recent years, but unbelted occupants still accounted for 58% of traffic fatalities in 2024, according to state data. Young drivers and passengers, particularly those 19 and under, are especially vulnerable—accounting for 18% of crashes. Adults aged 35 to 44 are also overrepresented in unrestrained crashes.
The campaign also highlights national data. In 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported 10,484 fatalities involving unbelted passengers. Alarmingly, 60% of those killed in back seats were not wearing seat belts, compared to 48% in the front. Nighttime driving proved especially dangerous, with 56% of those killed between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. not buckled up.
Officials stress that air bags alone are not enough and that improper seat belt use—such as wearing the strap under the arm or behind the back—can render safety systems ineffective.
In addition to enforcement, OHS is emphasizing public education. Among their key safety tips:

Lap belts should rest across the hips, not the stomach.
Shoulder belts should go across the chest and never behind the back or under the arm.
Caregivers are urged to model seatbelt use for children and to avoid prematurely advancing children to the next stage of car seat.

More information, including seatbelt safety resources and campaign details, can be found here.
“Whether you are using a seatbelt, booster seat, or five point harness car seat, these restraints are all designed to help save lives and should be used correctly,” Bryson said. “The results of not wearing a seatbelt can be devastating, and buckling up can help prevent serious injury and fatality for you and your passengers.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/istockphoto-1163597718-612x612-1.jpg,,,2025-05-19 13:12:21.304938

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The governor’s push for the executive branch to take on Nebraska medical cannabis regulations as a way to sidestep pending legislation at the statehouse would include no additional funding for months.
Gov. Jim Pillen’s spokesperson and the director of the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services confirmed Monday that under Pillen’s plan announced Friday, the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission still would have no additional funds to spend on developing rules or regulations. 
He announced his plan as lawmakers are set to debate Legislative Bill 677 Tuesday, which would legislatively create additional rules and regulations for the medical cannabis laws that voters overwhelmingly approved in November.
Pillen orders Nebraska medical cannabis regulations to proceed as legislative, legal fights approach

Under Pillen’s approach, the commission would need to make up for any spending later, such as through registration fees, though the commission’s ability to raise such revenue remains uncertain, as the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office has pledged to sue the new commission if it issues any state licenses for medical cannabis.
Pillen and Attorney General Mike Hilgers have questioned the legality of medical cannabis, though Pillen formally certified the vote in December and the laws have been in place since.
The governor’s Friday announcement referenced “operational funding” that had already been appropriated for the regulatory work, but when the next two-year state budget passed Thursday, it included limited new funding.
The Appropriations Committee offered an annual $30,000 each of the next two fiscal years for employees in the Liquor Control Commission, who take on additional duties under the new medical cannabis-related laws. In comparison, the Liquor Control Commission has a $2 million annual budget, including for enforcement of regulations.
The Medical Cannabis Commission has no additional funding for the remaining two months of the current fiscal year. 
The voter-approved laws required regulations by July 1 and licensing by Oct. 1.
The Department of Administrative Services, which Pillen oversees, can provide limited financial support to agencies crafting regulations. Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple, citing Lee Will, the DAS director who previously oversaw the state’s budget, said the Liquor Control Commission has a cash fund spending authority of $100,000 that is “rarely used.”
The new spending would come through a new administratively created cash fund to capture any new revenue.
“This funding authority will allow for [the Cannabis Commission] to operate, combined with registration fees for revenue,” she said in an email.
The one cash fund that the Liquor Control Commission currently has is derived from the commission selling copies of its rules, the law governing its actions and other publications. It also gets funds from fees for registration, server training and more, according to a Legislative Fiscal Office directory of state funds and programs. Just a portion of the fund has been used in recent years.
State law allows the funds to be used for “any administrative costs” associated with specific liquor statutes. Medical cannabis statutes were placed in a different section of the law, and the budget bills did not expressly authorize additional spending from that fund.

City officials have sued. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic will take their fight to court June 25 to determine whether the company can reopen its prison facility as an ICE detention center without going through a permitting process.
Attorneys for Leavenworth filed suit in March in U.S. District Court against the Nashville-based company, which ran the Leavenworth Detention Center before it was closed in 2021. The June 25 hearing is a scheduling hearing.
CoreCivic announced its intent to reopen its prison facility as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, which would be named the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
In its initial filing, city attorneys said CoreCivic must apply for and receive a supplemental use permit to reopen and operate the prison.
“Our facility – which has been in Leavenworth since 1992 – is and always has been properly zoned,” said CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin in an email. “Leavenworth’s city code designates our site as an existing special use and lawful conforming use.”
 Proper permits?

The city recently passed a resolution that indicated CoreCivic needed permission to open its facility, Gustin said.
“There’s nothing in Leavenworth’s code that allows for such a resolution to rescind zoning,” he said.
City officials do not agree. In a 211-page filing with attachments, their attorneys said that, while the lawsuit is about the need for proper permitting, there were other problems too.
From 1992 to 2021, when CoreCivic operated the detention center, the company “became embroiled in multiple widely publicized scandals resulting from its gross mismanagement of the Facility and the ensuing rampant abuse, violence, and violations of the constitutional rights of its detainees and staff,” the filing said.
“CoreCivic’s mismanagement directly and indirectly impacted the City in countless ways, including for example, by imposing unexpected maintenance costs on its taxpayers, unreasonably increasing the burden on the City’s police and law enforcement agencies to address violent crime, and even impeding the City’s investigation of sexual assaults and other violent crimes against detainees and staff,” the filing said.
The city’s lawsuit contends that CoreCivic was already operating the prison when the city enacted its development rules that require a permit, so the business was grandfathered in under the new rules. But by ceasing operations for three years, the filing said, CoreCivic must now apply for the special use permit.
In fact, CoreCivic applied for a special use permit in February 2025 but about three weeks later withdrew that application, the city’s filing said.
 Back and forth

Community activists are speaking about against the idea of CoreCivic operating a prison in Leavenworth.
Former CoreCivic employees regularly speak at city and county meetings about their negative experiences working in the closed detention center, and state organizations including the Kansas ACLU have helped organize press conferences and rallies. Objections include how CoreCivic operates, whether people held at the facility will be released into the community, and general opposition to immigrant detention centers.
Gustin said the company, as of April 30, had received applications from more than 1,100 people who want to work at the site.
“Despite what politically extreme outsider groups are saying, potential new employees and local business partners are excited to be part of what we’re creating in Leavenworth,” said Misty Mackey, warden of the new facility, in a press release. “We’re looking forward to operating a safe, transparent, accountable facility that will be a positive for this community dedicated to public service.”
Gustin said there has been inaccurate reporting about employees working on a job at the prison to replace the facility’s roof. CoreCivic issued cease-and-desist letters to those who accused the roofing company, Bass Roofing and Restoration, Fort Worth, of hiring workers without the proper permits.
“Any claims that our company has a contractor working for us at our Leavenworth facility that has undocumented or unauthorized workers doing the work are completely false,” he said. “We have been furnished documentation of the legal status of all workers on the roofing project at our facility from the primary contractor and subcontractor.”
The company has said that it will use local contractors at the facility, and Gustin said CoreCivic did reach out to local vendors.
“Experience in roofing our facilities and experience working on our federally contracted facilities is a factor we evaluate in reviewing bids,” he said. “It’s important to note that the roofing contractor who was selected for this project has handled similar work at another of our federal facilities, which required special clearances for workers.”
 Collaborative goals

Although aware of community disagreement about the facility, Gustin said CoreCivic wants to work with Leavenworth city and county officials.
“In addition to the impact fees we’ve agreed to pay – and the property tax we already pay – we’ve worked to both listen to and be transparent with the community,” he said.
CoreCivic has offered the following impact fees:

One-time impact fee of $1,000,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Annual impact fee of $250,000 to the city of Leavenworth
Additional $150,000 annually to the police department

Gustin said no one detained at the facility will be released directly into the Leavenworth community, which is one opposition point.
“Our facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability from our government partners, including regular audits and onsite monitors,” he said.

With 370,000 acres of active farmland, our agricultural sector contributes more than $4 billion annually to the state economy and supports 30,000 jobs. Yet despite this economic and social importance, Connecticut’s agrarian future is precarious. Between 2017 and 2022, we lost 463 farms. Rising production costs, climate pressures, and an aging farmer population threaten the future of farming in our state.
To support our farmers and secure a more resilient food system, we must start by rethinking how we value food, not as a commodity, but as a connector. Connecticut, one of the most urbanized states in the country, may not be the first place that comes to mind when you think of farmland. Yet it is precisely because of our size and geographic diversity that we are uniquely positioned to lead in local food innovation, if we invest in the right programs.

Zane Tickoo
Farm-to-school initiatives like CT Grown for CT Kids and the Connecticut Local Food for Schools Incentive Program are shining examples of what this kind of investment looks like. These programs connect local farmers with schools, ensuring that students receive fresh, nutritious meals while providing farmers with a stable, reliable market. It’s a win-win, children are better nourished, and farms are better supported.
That’s why recent developments are so alarming. In 2025, both programs faced devastating federal and state funding cuts. The USDA unexpectedly ended the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program, stripping $5.6 million from Connecticut’s farm-to-school pipeline. At the state level, Governor Lamont’s proposed budget would cut $1 million from the Department of Agriculture, effectively eliminating CT Grown for CT Kids. Without meaningful intervention, these setbacks threaten to undo years of progress toward building a healthier and more resilient local food system.
Fortunately, the legislature has a chance to reverse course. House Bill 7013, now under consideration, offers a path forward. It proposes measures to strengthen program coordination, outreach, and technical assistance with schools and ensure smoother implementation. The bill also expands program eligibility to include childcare providers, broadening the reach of local food access beyond K–12 settings.
Just as importantly, HB 7013 and the proposed Appropriations budget seeks sustained funding for both programs, providing the financial stability needed for them to thrive. Organizations like the Connecticut Northeast Organic Farming Association (CT NOFA) have voiced strong support, recognizing the bill’s potential to bolster local agriculture, improve student nutrition, and increase public awareness around food systems.
This isn’t just smart policy,  it’s a moral imperative. Supporting farm-to-school programs isn’t just about feeding kids; it’s about shaping the next generation of Connecticut’s farmers, food entrepreneurs, and engaged citizens. When students learn where their food comes from, they gain a deeper appreciation for the land, labor, and community behind every meal.
Moreover, these programs can help address one of the most pressing challenges in agriculture today: a lack of young people entering the field. Farming is often viewed as inaccessible, outdated, or financially unviable. But by embedding food literacy into school curricula, expanding school gardens, and exposing students to sustainable farming practices, we can help change the narrative and inspire a new generation to see farming as both a calling and a career.
If we want a future in which Connecticut’s farms flourish and our children grow up nourished in every sense of the word, we must start by protecting and expanding these programs. That means not only preserving existing farmland but also investing in the infrastructure, both physical and educational, that connects people to it.
The future of Connecticut’s food system depends on bold, community-centered action. HB 7013 and funding for farm-to-school represents a critical next step to affirm a vision for Connecticut in which every child has access to healthy food, every farmer has access to a strong market, and every community has a stake in the resilience of our local food system.
Contact your legislators. Let them know that food matters, not just to our plates, but to our economy, our health, and our shared future.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

Laura Kelly assesses work of 2025 Kansas Legislature and weighty education, tax, budget and judicial reform issues on state's horizon.","Gov. Laura Kelly, with about 20 months remaining in her second term, takes stock on the Kansas Reflector podcast work of 2025 Legislature and significant education, tax, budget and judicial issues on horizon. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly wants the Republican-dominated legislative committee drafting a new state funding formula for K-12 public school districts to work on behalf of all Kansans by resisting pressure to funnel tax dollars into private schools.
Kelly, a Democrat nearing the home stretch of her second term as governor, said the existing formula was the product of years of work by the legislative and executive branches of state government and met the judicial branch’s view of Article 6 of the Kansas Constitution by making suitable provision for financing the state’s educational interest in children.
The current formula has led to full funding of public school districts, Kelly said. It could be improved before expiring in 2027, the governor said, but major overhaul could invite years of new litigation.
“Obviously, what I would really like is for them to tweak around the edges of what we’ve already got,” Kelly said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “This is a formula that has really been decades in the making. It works for Kansas. Are there things that could be better, could be done differently? I’m sure that there are.”


“I would hope that, you know, deep down, what they’re really trying to do is to make our public school system the best in the country,” Kelly said. “Not looking for ways to undermine it and divert funds from that to private schools.”
During the interview, Kelly discussed issues shaping the final 20 months of her service as governor, including budget and policy decisions of President Donald Trump, the 2026 vote on a state constitutional amendment to elect members of the Kansas Supreme Court and formation of the state’s early childhood education office.
She looked back at pivot points in the 2024 session of the Legislature, most notably decisions to emphasize state income tax reductions rather than property tax reform.
 
Trump’s influence
Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, expressed disagreement with Trump’s willingness to upend federal funding to states in ways that generated chaos and harmed people. Thousands of federal workers have been sacked along with hundreds of millions of dollars in funding slashed, she said.
In Kansas, sudden withdrawal of a federal grant led Kelly to authorize layoffs of 56 employees at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
She said sweeping reductions in federal funding of Medicaid, the health program relied on by people with disabilities, low-income children, elderly adults and pregnant women, would be devastating in Kansas.
“We were taking a very public stance and working very hard with our congressional delegations and others to ensure that Congress does not make those kinds of drastic cuts to a program that is extraordinarily important, not only to some citizens of the state of Kansas, but to the state itself. It would create economic havoc if they were to withdraw Medicaid funding,” Kelly said.
Kelly said she would work against the proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution to allow direct public election of state Supreme Court justices and do away with the merit-based process vesting governors with responsibility to fill vacancies on the state’s highest court.
More than $100 million was spent on this spring’s Wisconsin Supreme Court election. It set a national record for expenditures on a state judicial race.
“I don’t think Kansans want to go that way, and I think they will speak loudly in August of 2026 just as they did in August of 2022 when the Legislature tried to essentially eliminate reproductive rights in the state of Kansas,” Kelly said.
By two-thirds majorities — 27-13 in the Senate and 84-40 in the House — the Kansas Legislature disagreed with Kelly by voting to place the Supreme Court amendment on ballots next year.
The governor said she was pleased the Legislature created the state Office of Early Childhood, which would consolidate programs spread across several agencies.
“We will save money and other resources by putting it all under this one umbrella, and we’ll be able to provide much better services,” she said.
Kelly also lauded formation of a state task force to create a “comprehensive, thoughtful, long-range plan with dedicated funding so that we address our water issues” much like the state dealt for decades with transportation planning.
 
Tax and budget policy
Kelly said the Legislature would regret following the $1.3 billion state income tax cut approved in 2024 with legislation in 2025 dedicating future state revenue surpluses to more individual and corporate income tax reductions. The House and Senate overrode Kelly’s veto of the bill obligating the state to lower income tax rates to 4%.
“When tax revenues come in higher than expected, your taxes go down automatically — a sensible way to return tax dollars to Kansans that only Governor Kelly could oppose,” said Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, both Republicans.
Kelly said additional income tax cuts would kick in automatically regardless of economic factors or policy and budgetary realities. She said it was the kind of thinking that led Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback in 2012 and 2013 to aggressively slash income taxes. It starved state government and prompted a sales tax hike, increased borrowing and derailed highway and education funding before abandoned in 2017.
“What we’ve been left with is essentially a flat tax,” Kelly said of the 2025 income tax law. “That’s the kiss of death for the Kansas budget and the public services that we’ve been providing. It won’t be as fast or as dramatic as the impact of the Brownback tax experiment, but ultimately have the same effect.”

The deadline to apply is Sunday, May 25, according to a news release from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
Meanwhile, Kentuckians affected by severe April storms have until June 25 to apply for federal disaster assistance. 
The February storms were followed by bitter cold temperatures, leading to more deaths throughout the week. Emergency crews made more than 1,000 rescues. 
Homeowners and renters in the following counties must submit their applications by Sunday: Breathitt, Clay, Estill, Floyd, Harlan, Johnson, Knott, Lee, Leslie, Letcher, Martin, Owsley, Perry, Pike, Simpson and Woodford. 
Homeowners and renters in Woodford County may be eligible for federal disaster assistance due to property damage or losses from the February and April storms. However, they must submit two separate applications. 
Applications for FEMA assistance can be made online at DisasterAssistance.gov, by visiting a Disaster Recovery Center, using the FEMA mobile app, or calling the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362. 
To find the nearest Disaster Recovery Center, visit fema.gov/DRC online or text DRC along with your Zip Code to 43362. The FEMA Helpline is open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern Time. 
To apply for assistance, applicants must provide information such as a current phone number, their social security number, a general list of damage and losses, banking information for direct deposit, and their address at the time of the disaster and where they are now sheltering or staying. Applicants must also provide insurance information if they have it, like a policy number and their agent or company name.  
Kentucky is in the process of seeking FEMA assistance for victims of last weekend’s tornado outbreak, but it’s too early for individuals to apply for aid recovering from the most recent sever weather. 
Gov. Andy Beshear in a briefing in London on Saturday urged homeowners and renters to contact their insurance companies now and also to document their losses for future applications for federal aid.

A PNM news release says the deal, if approved by the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission, along with Texas and federal regulators, would leave the company headquartered in New Mexico.
“This agreement will provide the financial resources necessary to thrive in this rapidly changing energy environment,” PNM President and CEO Don Tarry said in a statement “Our focus has been and will continue to be on serving our customers with safe, reliable energy. This investment will help us meet the considerable growth in demand while supporting the transition to a clean energy future and unlocking New Mexico’s potential for economic growth.”
Under the proposed agreement, Blackstone Infrastructure will acquire TXNM Energy for $61.25 per share upon closing for a “total enterprise value of $11.5 billion — including net debt — and TXNM Energy’s stock would no longer be publicly traded. A news release says the company expects the process to be completed in the second half of 2026.
Blackstone, which has $60 billion of assets under management, focuses on North American infrastructure platforms. The Wall Street Journal reports in the interim, Blackstone Infrastructure plans to invest $400 million in TXNM through the purchase of 8 million newly issued shares at $50 apiece to support TXNM’s plans for growth.
“PNM has done an excellent job of transitioning its generation portfolio to clean energy and supporting the communities it serves,”  Sean Klimczak, Blackstone’s global head of infrastructure, said in a statement. “We will utilize our long-term investment approach to support PNM’s economic development efforts during New Mexico’s sustainable generation transition. We share PNM’s deep commitment to the customers and communities they serve and we look forward to meaningfully engaging with PNM’s stakeholders.”

Tate IV (Photo: Nick Romanenko/Rutgers University)LSU President William Tate has been named the next leader of Rutgers University in New Jersey, becoming the most notable in a string of abrupt, high-profile departures from Louisiana’s flagship public university. 
The Rutgers Board of Trustees unanimously confirmed Tate’s appointment Monday. He will begin his new job at the university July 1. His last day at LSU will be June 30. 
LSU spokesman Todd Woodward said an interim president will be announced Monday. 
Tate is the fourth administrator to leave LSU’s main campus this year. He follows the abrupt departures of General Counsel Winston DeCuir and Chief Administrative Officer Kimberly Lewis, who were two of the highest-ranking Black administrators at LSU. Provost Roy Haggerty also made his exit recently.
In addition, LSU Health Shreveport Chancellor David Guzick resigned under pressure and has taken a new role in the LSU System.  
Tate’s departure had been rumored for weeks amid discussions of splitting the roles of LSU System president and Baton Rouge campus chancellor, which were combined in 2012. 
LSU saw major growth in enrollment and research spending during Tate’s time at LSU. As Tate sought to boost research expenditures for his long-shot bid to join the prestigious American Association of Universities, spending on research grew from less than $300 million in the 2020-21 academic year to more than $500 million in 2023-24, the most recent year with data available. 
Though Tate’s hiring as LSU’s first Black president — the first at any Southeastern Conference University — was met with much fanfare, his tenure has been highly criticized for his stances on race and gender.   
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In his first year on the job, Tate disbanded a committee looking into the possibility of renaming 13 buildings on campus named after racially problematic figures, They included the John M. Parker Coliseum, named after the former governor who participated in the largest mass lynching in American history. 
Tate promised reform after taking the helm of a university reeling from a Title IX scandal that ensued after a USA Today investigative report that revealed how the university mishandled sexual misconduct complaints against student-athletes.
He subsequently combined LSU’s Title IX, Civil Rights and diversity, equity and inclusion offices, dismissing a number of highly respected administrators and installing Todd Manuel, a former utility executive with no higher education experience, as the vice president of the office. 
Tate oversaw the dismantling of the DEI function of Manuel’s office in January 2024 ahead of conservative Gov. Jeff Landry taking office. Manuel has faced accusations that he and his deputies engaged in the very acts the office is designed to prevent. 
Off the clock, Tate also made problematic comments. Most notably, he shared a video from an anti-transgender group on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, that amplified misinformation about an Olympic boxer Imane Khelif, who is not transgender. 
“This is illegal in Louisiana,” Tate wrote. “We have established guidelines in our laws. Why don’t the Olympics go to two divisions — Open and Women? It allows everyone to compete. Will it take a death to stop this at the Olympic level?” 
Though Tate later apologized for the error, his original comment is still on his X page. 
Tate’s struggles on race and gender puzzled many who lauded LSU for hiring a Black man with significant scholarship on critical race theory to lead a university with a long and, at times, ugly racial history, starting long before the current campus was built atop a cemetery for enslaved people. 
At the time of his hiring, Tate enjoyed the support of Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. Tate came out of the gate hot with talk of reform and used his early capital to hire other Black administrators, including Lewis, who had been serving as Edwards’ revenue department secretary, for a newly created position. 
But with a governor in office who had put LSU in his crosshairs, Tate seemed stuck between a rock and a hard place. Major donors to Landry now make up a majority of the LSU Board of Supervisors to whom the LSU president reports. 
Landry has more control over the state’s four higher education systems than his predecessors after he signed legislation giving him the power to select board chairs, which he used to place Scott Ballard in charge of the LSU board. 
Landry’s LSU board has been more vocal and more political than Edwards’, with members at times even calling for popular officials to be dismissed in open meetings. 
When Landry put tenured LSU Law Professor Ken Levy on blast on social media for profane and critical comments Levy made about the governor to students, Tate pulled Levy from the classroom and put him on paid administrative leave. The matter sparked a lawsuit against the university that is ongoing in court. 
Before coming to LSU, Tate served as provost of the University of South Carolina for less than a year and as department chair and graduate school dean Washington University in St. Louis from 2002-20.

Citizen Foster Care Review Boards review cases of children in the custody of the Department for Community Based Services in the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Service, according to the program’s website. The children were placed in foster care due to dependency, neglect and abuse, but their cases are not final. They may include children whose adoptions have not been finalized or have returned home and young adults with extended out-of-home commitments due to educational purposes. 
A press release from the Administrative Office of the Courts said the counties in dire need of volunteers are Boone, Boyd, Bracken, Campbell, Carter, Clay, Elliott, Fleming, Greenup, Hardin, Johnson, Kenton, Laurel, Lawrence, Lewis, Magoffin, Martin, Mason, McCreary, Montgomery, Morgan, Powell, Robertson, Rowan, Whitley and Wolfe. However, volunteers also are needed statewide. 
“It takes a lot of wonderful people to do this meaningful work, and we are greatly in need of more volunteers to join us,” said Rosalyn Patton-Pelt, state chair of the foster care review board, in a statement. 
Volunteers typically review cases one day a month. However, before they can begin, they must apply for consideration, consent to a criminal record and central registry check and complete six hours of initial training. A family court or district court judge recommends volunteers to the local review board. Detailed information, including how to submit an online volunteer application, can be found on the Kentucky Courts of Justice website. 
The Administrative Office of the Courts said thousands of Kentucky children are placed in foster and other out-of-home care each year. The Citizen Foster Care Review Boards conduct interactive reviews on the children’s cases and make recommendations to the cabinet.

Cloud seeding is a real field of scientific study, but can be rife with misinformation. (Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator)Two bills to ban weather modification in Louisiana have quietly moved their way through the state legislature this session, as a cohort of other states have moved to do the same with technology that purports to encourage rain or alter temperature.
Senate Bill 46, sponsored by Sen. “Big Mike” Fesi, R-Houma, and House Bill 608, by Rep. Kim Coates, R-Ponchatoula, would ban the intentional release of chemicals into the atmosphere to alter the weather or climate. Coates’ measure includes a $200,000 fine for any violation.  
Weather modification is a wide-reaching term and often marbled with deep veins of misinformation. Human efforts and theories that attempt to alter precipitation or temperature are real but largely new areas of scientific study. The concept of weather modification has produced solid science along with skepticism and conspiracy theories in the decades since studies began.
The Louisiana bills specifically reference cloud seeding, or attempts to encourage rainfall with aerosols sprayed into the air. They also cover solar radiation modification, which tries to deflect sunlight away from Earth to curb increasing temperatures and associated climate change. 
Cloud seeding experiments are exceedingly rare along the Gulf Coast, and solar radiation modification exists only as a theoretical concept. Robert Rauber, an atmospheric scientist and professor emeritus at the University of Illinois, said cloud seeding simply doesn’t have widespread use in Louisiana, where rain is relatively abundant. 
“The Gulf Coast doesn’t need rain,” Rauber said, unlike the mountainous or desert states where cloud seeding is a more attractive option. “The reason why they cloud seed out west is to increase water supplies.” 
Rauber has participated in a variety of cloud seeding experiments in mountainous regions of the western United States and said the types of clouds along the Gulf Coast aren’t really conducive for seeding.
“It’s never been proven to work” at scale with the puffy, cumulus clouds more common in the South, said Rauber. “These clouds form wherever the heck they want … you can’t target an area very effectively.”
Cloud seeding can’t alter the paths or intensity of hurricanes either, said Rauber. He cited failed experiments in the 1940s when scientists seeded hurricanes with dry ice to see if they could weaken their intensity. Although researchers learned valuable information on how hurricanes formed and traveled, they were not able to change their path or intensity. 
One business has conducted cloud seeding experiments along the Gulf Coast, according to Rauber, who stressed that the science is shaky. 
Rainmaker Technology Corp., a geoengineering company based in El Segundo, California, has conducted experiments along the Gulf Coast as recently as March, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records. The company claims to use charged water particles to promote rain instead of aerosols. 
“It’s magic as far as I’m concerned because I have not seen any scientific research done in a proper way that shows that any of that is effective,” Rauber said. Misinformation and unproven methods that Rainmaker Technology and other companies promote adds to public fear and conspiracy theories surrounding weather modification, the professor said. 
Rainmaker Technology did not respond to calls for comment. 
Cloud seeding with silver iodide has been practiced for more than 70 years, and the scientific consensus is that the amount used is relatively effective, with the right clouds, and environmentally safe. Sprayed into clouds as an aerosol, silver iodide freezes and gives moisture-heavy clouds something to grab onto, coaxing its water molecules to condense and fall from the sky as rain. 
James Diaz, a medical toxicologist and professor emeritus at the LSU Health Sciences Center School of Public Health in New Orleans, said silver can prompt reactions when ingested in large doses and lab experiments suggest the heavy metal could be harmful to aquatic life in large amounts over time, but he said the amounts used for cloud seeding do not alarm him.
“These toxicities are unlikely after cloud seeding,” Diaz said.
It’s a similar story with iodide. Large amounts over long periods of time can do environmental and health harm, but Diaz said the amounts needed for cloud seeding aren’t worrying. 
“We should be more concerned about petrochemicals and pesticides,” he said. 
Fesi’s bill doesn’t apply to firefighting aerosols or pesticides used for agriculture. Coates said in an interview she intends to amend her bill so that it would not apply to pollutants emitted from the burning of fossil fuels. 
Fesi mentioned in his floor speech that sulfur dioxide is among the chemicals he believes are being sprayed into the atmosphere. There is no evidence that cloud seeding uses sulfur dioxide. The burning of fossil fuels, namely coal and oil at power plants and industrial facilities, is one of the largest sources of sulfur dioxide, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Coates and Fesi clarified in interviews their bills will not regulate industrial emissions. 
Coates said she considers her bill to be part of the wider push in Republican-led states to ban weather modification, adding she believes the issue to have bipartisan appeal. Florida recently approved legislation similar to what’s under consideration in Louisiana, and Tennessee approved a ban on weather modification in 2024. 
“I just decided that I wanted to bring the bill because I don’t feel like anyone in Louisiana gave someone the right to do research in the air above us,” Coates said. “That’s our air above us, and we haven’t given anybody permission, anybody the right to spray or do any modification above us.”
When asked about the lack of widespread weather modification experiments in Louisiana, Coates said her bill is more precautionary. 
“Why mess with Mother Nature?” she added.
Coates’ bill advanced from the House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment with unanimous support and awaits debate in the full House.
Fesi testified on the Senate floor April 28 during debate over his bill that he believes “certain agencies within the federal government are doing cloud seeding and geoengineering.” In an interview Friday, the senator was asked what evidence he had to support his claims. 
“Look up in our sky,” Fesi answered.
In an interview, Fesi later said he sees “just tons and tons of cloud seeding” above his backyard and described it as “all of the stripes across the skies.”
Neither bill specifically discusses banning contrails, short for condensation trails. The thin, white cloud streaks that stretch behind airplanes are created as warm exhaust from jet engines meet the icy cold atmosphere, similarly to how warm breath briefly creates a fog in cold air. Unsubstantiated contrail theories attempt to connect weather modification and contrails, alleging jets are spraying chemicals for reasons ranging from weather alterations to population control.
Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, was the only lawmaker to question Fesi’s claims on the Senate floor. He responded that “32 different agencies collect money for geoengineering of our weather.” Pressed by Barrow for details, Fesi shared a widely debunked conspiracy theory that the federal government is spraying aerosols to block sunlight, and that the materials – namely aluminum oxide – have been found in agricultural fields from contrail chemical spraying. 
No evidence exists of a government program that conducts or collects money for cloud seeding or solar radiation modification experiments. 
With no one else challenging his statements, Fesi’s bill advanced from the Senate on a 27-12 party line vote, with Republicans prevailing. The measure awaits committee consideration in the House of Representatives.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8649-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 11:14:03.142028

Lawmakers are advancing two bills that could lead to wage increases for some of them.,"In summary
Many people in California prisons and jails work for less than $1 an hour. Lawmakers are advancing two bills that could lead to wage increases for some of them.


Despite voters’ rejection of a ballot measure last fall to amend the state constitution to abolish involuntary prison labor, Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Los Angeles believes he can get two bills passed that would improve wages for individuals inside jail and prison.
“It’s an interesting moment,” said Bryan, vice chair of the Legislative Black caucus, as he spoke of the Los Angeles fires and the public recognition of hard-working incarcerated fire crews.
“I think that reopened this conversation in the consciousness for folks about what incarcerated labor can look like and how undignified not paying folks a human wage — you know, a basic wage that is dignified — what that says about all of us.”
His Assembly Bill 247 would impose $19 per hour pay for incarcerated firefighters whenever their work assignment places them in active fire incidents.
“Very few people realize they make $5 to $10 a day doing that work, and so legislation to increase those wages has received kind of resounding support,” said Bryan.
The other measure, AB 248, doesn’t necessarily have an immediate price tag, but it would remove a decades-old statewide wage cap of $2 per eight-hour shift for county jail inmate workers — many of whom have not been convicted of any crimes and are awaiting trial.
Both of Bryan’s measures build on the Black Caucus’ efforts over the past several years to tackle the state’s history of discrimination against African Americans and to implement recommendations from the California Reparations Task Force.
In the immediate post-Civil War era, California prisons exploited incarcerated laborers — mostly Black and Indigenous — under threat of punishment. The task force described current prisoner work assignments as “state-sanctioned involuntary servitude” and a direct legacy of slavery. 
So far, the proposals that would carry out those changes have failed, most notably when voters in November rejected Proposition 6, the ballot measure that would have revised the state constitution to prohibit involuntary labor.
This year, Bryan’s bills are moving forward despite some concerns from Republican lawmakers that they could increase spending and threaten existing work programs that they support.
“This bill ignores the fundamental purpose of inmate labor programs,” Republican Assemblymember Heather Hadwick of Grass Valley said last month when she voted against the bill that would lift the cap on wages in county jails. “They’re not traditional employment. They’re part of a rehabilitation process that provides structure, skill building and a sense of responsibility. My rural counties cannot foot this bill.”
Most California county jails do not pay incarcerated workers any wages whatsoever. But when they do, they must abide by the $2 limit.
“For those quick at math, that’s 25 cents an hour,” explained Bryan. “At that rate, combined with predatory commissary prices, it would take you a full business week to be able to afford a two-ounce tube of toothpaste and a bag of hot Cheetos.” 
Mopping floors, cleaning toilets, preparing and distributing three meals a day for all persons in lockup — sheriffs and jailers treat these essential jobs as privileges bestowed on individuals who choose to trade work for time outside their cells and other perks, such as guaranteed daily showers or extra food.
Depriving incarcerated laborers of any substantial wage also limits their ability to pay court-mandated victims’ restitution fees, Bryan said. Despite working full time — and often even overtime, seven days a week — many prisoners continue to carry the debt of restitution.
“It is a relic of slavery — for sure,” said Bryan.

The California Supreme Court determined last year that county jail inmate workers — even those whose incarceration does not ultimately result in criminal convictions — are not entitled to state minimum wage requirements. In Ruelas vs. Alameda County, the court interpreted state law to define county jail work compensation as adequate in terms of offering sentence work credit, rehabilitative value and job-skills training opportunities.
“Whether the result here, based on an interpretation of the current statutory scheme, is a desirable policy is a matter beyond our purview, but it is not beyond the Legislature’s,” wrote Justice Kelli M. Evans in the April 2024 ruling. “The Legislature can, if it sees fit, adjust its approach to the payment of wages or wage credits for those awaiting adjudication of their cases as well as for convicted persons.”
Bryan, in co-authorship with Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park, aims to accomplish this adjustment to the state legislation.
California sheriffs oppose jail wage bill
The California State Sheriffs’ Association opposes the bill and said in a letter to the Assembly Public Safety Committee that it “would create pressure on counties to increase the fiscal recompense provided to inmate workers, thereby potentially limiting the availability of opportunities for work while incarcerated.”
Bryan noted that his county jail wage bill carries zero fiscal liability and therefore does not need to pass an appropriations committee. 
“This bill could pass and it could change nothing today,” said Bryan. “But it does mean at some point in the future — if there’s a county where the people of that county and the board of the county decide that it’s undignified to have people working for a quarter an hour, no matter whether they are incarcerated or not — they won’t have a preemption problem with the state. That’s all we’re trying to do is remove the state thumb on the scale that shouldn’t be there.”
Assemblymember Josh Hoover of Folsom, a district known for its century-old prison, explained his support for the bill. 
“We already have a $2 wage in the code, which means we have already acknowledged that there should be a wage paid,” he said. “I think it makes sense for local governments to be able to determine what that wage is, based upon the needs of their community.”
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego said he opposes offering counties the authority to pay incarcerated workers more.
“We can get into the whole debate about rehabilitation, but the reality is when people are in jail, when they’re in prison, there’s a substantial cost to taxpayers,” he said. “It’s not unreasonable to expect inmates to help chip in to do a little bit of the work — clean their cell, do the laundry, serve the food.”
Work and rehabilitation in prison
Yet the debate over rehabilitation did quickly find its way into the Assembly’s conversation.
Because Gov. Gavin Newsom bases much of his transformative California model philosophy — which emphasizes rehabilitation, education, and reentry over punishment — on reforms first developed inside Norway’s prison system, detractors often view it with skepticism.
“The governor likes the Norwegian model, so I’m a little suspicious about this so-called Norwegian model,” DeMaio said. “But apparently there are some really good elements to the Norwegian model which includes $8 for work. Oh, no, no — not per hour, per week — and it’s part of the rehabilitation process.”
Bryan addressed DeMaio’s points in his closing. “I’ve been to Norway. I’ve seen it up close,” he said. “Folks in Norway are allowed to vote in prison; they go home on the weekends; often and during the week, they work outside of the prison and then come back; they earn real wages in their community and store that money up.
“There’s much we can learn from the Norwegian model, and so I look forward to exploring that with my colleague from San Diego.”

With 51 aye votes — all Democratic, save for Hoover’s lone Republican vote, 12 nays — all Republican, and 17 members (10 Democrats) formally choosing to cast no vote, the jail wage measure passed through the Assembly and now awaits Senate approval.
The Anti-Recidivism Coalition supports both of Bryan’s bills and co-sponsored AB 247, in addition to their overall advocacy for renewed anti-slavery legislation Assembly Constitutional Amendment 6, which would end California prison policies that require incarcerated individuals to fulfill labor obligations. Voters rejected 2024’s similar Prop. 6, but the measure will most likely resurface on a 2026 ballot. 
“When we got rid of the slave movement, we really shifted into utilizing prison labor as an alternative, and using the fact that these folks have been stripped of their freedom as a means to take advantage of them,” said the coalition’s chief strategy consultant and lobbyist, Esteban Núñez.
“You can work all day every day inside, and at the end of the month have barely enough to buy yourself what little hygiene you can. And that’s just not right. Keeping people in poverty and not compensating people fairly — purposely to keep them in poverty — it’s de-humanizing, at best.”

(Photo by Corrie Boudreaux for Source NM)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has “deep reservations” about a plan for the Department of Homeland Security to use National Guard members to help with federal immigration enforcement.
The plan, first reported by the New York Times on Thursday, would pull in 20,000 members to increase enforcement capacity amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. Governors would be asked for National Guard troops to help with the detention and deportation of immigrants without legal status, though it is not clear what specific role troops would serve, according to NPR. The plan is being reviewed by Department of Defense lawyers.
“Our national guard members play an important role in protecting our state at home and abroad and the Governor would have deep reservations about pulling guard members away from core functions at a time when resources are being cut in these critical areas, further straining resources needed for public safety by diverting resources to a federal responsibility,” Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman wrote in an email. “Gov. Polis calls on Congress to do their part and pass comprehensive immigration reform that secures our border, provides adequate personnel for border and interior enforcement so that they don’t need to take away national guard units from the states, and creates a pathway to citizenship.”

The Colorado Army National Guard and Colorado Air National Guard comprises about 5,500 people who serve part-time under the governor’s direction. Often, they respond to disasters in the state.
A spokesperson for the Colorado National Guard said it has not received any communication about a plan to ask members to volunteer for immigration enforcement.
Trump administration officials such as Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for policy, have suggested that that National Guard troops from Republican-led states could be deployed in states, like Colorado, governed by Democrats. Democratic lawmakers in the Colorado Legislature passed a sweeping immigrant rights bill during the legislative session this year. It included a provision that would ban military units from another state from entering Colorado without the governor’s permission.
“Any time we have someone else’s National Guard that wants to come into this state, agreements happen. The governor’s office has asked for support in this area,” Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat and the bill’s sponsor, said during floor debate on May 2. “We have seen buses come forward without any warning from Texas. Who’s to say that (Texas) Gov. (Greg) Abbott wouldn’t just throw his National Guard straight into Colorado because they decided to do immigration enforcement here?”
A Polis spokesperson in November after Trump’s election told Newsline in a statement, “It would be a violation of state sovereignty for another state to send National Guard troops without a request from the state.”
Many of the approximately 40,000 migrants who arrived in Denver since 2022 came on buses sent from Texas at Abbott’s direction. In February, Abbott gave the Texas National Guard the authority to make immigration arrests.
Polis has not signed that immigration bill, Senate Bill 25-276, into law. Though it would bar other states from sending their National Guard troops into Colorado, it would do little if Trump federalized the National Guard to perform law enforcement activities under the Insurrection Act, which was last invoked in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots after the police beating of Rodney King.
Bill sponsor state Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, told Newsline that the provision in question is comparable to laws in other states, including Texas.
“So it depends exactly what Trump, and potentially Trump-allied governors, proceed to do,” he wrote in an email. “The mere fact that Trump is trying to corral guards members for his anti-immigrant efforts is yet another sign of the rapid disintegration of norms and precedents in this country.”

Anglers planning to surf fish at Delaware State Parks over the summer will need a reservation on weekends and holidays starting Saturday, May 24, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced.
The reservation requirement, which applies to the state’s seven multi-use drive-on beaches, is part of DNREC’s effort to manage demand and preserve beach access during peak season.
Reservations for the May 24 kickoff can be made beginning Tuesday, May 20, at 11 a.m., and will continue each week for upcoming weekend dates.
READ: Delaware launches fund to boost access to capital in underserved communities
The policy affects holders of annual and two-year surf fishing permits who wish to drive onto state park beaches between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays through Labor Day.
Off-peak permit holders are excluded from the reservation system, as their permits only allow beach access during non-peak times.
Reservations, which cost a non-refundable $4 per vehicle, must be made online here or by phone.
Spots are available on a first-come, first-served basis until sold out.
Reservations open the Tuesday before each Saturday and the Wednesday before each Sunday.
For weekday holidays, such as Memorial Day (May 26), Juneteenth (June 19), Independence Day (July 4), and Labor Day (Sept. 1), the system opens the Thursday prior.
DNREC says the reservation system has been upgraded in response to angler feedback.
Now, vehicle information is automatically linked to reservations when a valid surf fishing permit number is entered. Users can also manage multiple reservations for different permits under a single account.
Permit holders are required to print and display their reservation confirmation in their vehicle for verification by Delaware Natural Resources Police. Those with valid reservations are guaranteed park access even if general day-use parking reaches capacity.
DNREC encourages anglers to cancel reservations they don’t plan to use to allow other fishermen the chance to secure a spot.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Light-Tackle-With-Perch-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-05-19 11:14:03.142028

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Five of the six candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for governor on June 10 met for their final debate of the campaign on Sunday. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:
 Gloves on

Rep. Mikie Sherrill is the presumptive front-runner based on public polling, though her rivals didn’t go after her in any meaningful way.
Even Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who was aggressive in his interactions with Sherrill during a debate last week and has taken many swipes at her on social media, avoided confrontation with her Sunday. Fulop was asked about that during a press conference following the debate.
“I didn’t think she was that relevant in the debate, to be honest with you, because she didn’t insert herself in a lot of the conversations, so I didn’t feel the need to say I disagree,” he said. “She didn’t really speak … much on the transportation front nor on the health care or education front in any substantive way.”
Sherrill’s team, who were watching this press conference from the audience, looked quizzical. It’s clear that Sherrill has been running more of a bio campaign than one based on specifics about what she’d do as governor, but she certainly offered specifics last night, saying she backs teacher certification programs for long-term substitutes, a planned light rail line connecting Glassboro and Camden, and an independent auditing of the state’s health benefits plan.
 Baraka v. Gottheimer

There were only a few moments of genuine sparring on the debate stage, most notably an angry exchange between Rep. Josh Gottheimer and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka when Gottheimer said as governor he would make sure New Jersey gets its share of federal dollars back. Baraka said this confused him.
“I’m trying to figure out why they have to wait to become governor to get more money back from the government, because that’s their job as Congress people,” Baraka said. “You should not wait to become the governor to do that for us today. That’s his job today.”
Gottheimer, saying he wanted to “fact check” Baraka, said he’s helped the 5th Congressional District, which he represents, win more federal dollars than his predecessors.
“In my district, because we’ve been working with our mayors, we’re up 357% since I’ve been in Congress,” Gottheimer said.
“We’re talking about the whole state here, we’re not talking about your district,” Baraka said.
There appears to be little love lost between these two. During last week’s debate, Gottheimer snapped at Baraka when Baraka kept giving Gottheimer condescending pats. And during one of Gottheimer’s answers Sunday on public worker health care costs, Baraka could be heard saying, “He has no idea what he’s talking about.”
 Newark airport

Two candidates, Fulop and Gottheimer, urged people to keep using Newark airport despite weeks of news about long delays and problems with air traffic control equipment. “People should keep flying out of Newark,” Gottheimer said. For what, Jersey pride? No, thanks.
 Fighting

Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney was in a fighting mood. About the problems at Newark airport, Sweeney pooh-poohed writing letters to federal officials seeking help, as our current governor has done. “Drag their asses into a hearing … Let’s start breaking their you-know-whats,” he said. Later, while accusing New York of bullying New Jersey with its congestion pricing toll, Sweeney said, “When you deal with a bully, you punch them right in the nose and they pay attention.”

 Electability

During Baraka’s closing argument, he noted that some of his rivals have engaged in a whisper campaign that, should he win the June 10 primary, he would be unelectable as a general election candidate.
“I’m going to tell you why they say I’m not electable. One, because I’m from Newark. Two, because I’m too progressive. And three, because I’m too black. Well, I like being from Newark. I like being from Newark. As a matter of fact, I think because you’re closest to the problems, you’re closest to the solutions. I also like being progressive. I like being progressive and standing on my progressive values. I think that’s what brings us together. And I can’t do nothing about being black. God made me beautiful and amazing on purpose,” he said.
 Change

Many of the candidates are running campaigns based on the idea that voters will want something different after eight years of Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat. Sweeney, who was in the Legislature for 20 years and led the state Senate for about a decade, said voters should instead pick an insider.
“I’m the candidate that understands the inside and out of Trenton. You know, you always hear, we need an outsider to change things. Well, you know what happens? They come there and after two years, they figure it out — now they’re running for reelection and unfortunately it’s too late,” he said.
 Wawa

Gottheimer, repeating something he’s said many times on the campaign trail, griped that property taxes are high because there are too many towns in New Jersey with their own bureaucracies.
“Instead of buying in bulk, as I said, we pay Wawa prices instead of Costco prices for health care, for salt on our roads, and then what happens is all this gets fed into our property taxes that are killing people,” he said.
I continue to be baffled by this talking point because I’ve always found items at Wawa to be pretty cheap. They also have free air for your tires and that line is always long.
Baraka quipped, “I don’t want my health care from Wawa or Costco.”
 Oops?

Fulop argued that voters should send a mayor to the governor’s mansion, saying, “You haven’t had one for 20 years.” That’s right, and that former mayor-turned-governor was … Jim McGreevey.
 One common enemy

There are five men running for the GOP primary, but you wouldn’t know it from Sunday’s debate, when only one of them — former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli — was the focus of Democrats’ attacks. Ciattarelli was the GOP nominee for governor in 2021, he has led in all of the public polling of this year’s race, and he has the endorsement of Donald Trump, so Democrats on Sunday treated him as the presumptive Republican nominee. Sherrill opened her remarks with an attack on Ciattarelli, not on any of the men vying with her for the Dem nomination in three weeks.
“We know what the stakes are. We know Jack Ciattarelli has promised to DOGE New Jersey. Trump has said he’s ‘100% MAGA.’  He said he’s going to not stand up to Trump on anything and go along with everything. And we also know that he said he’s going to cut funding for Planned Parenthood and put in place an abortion ban,” Sherrill said.
 Length

The debate was looooooong. After two hours and 30 minutes on the stage, the six candidates later did solo press conferences. I overheard Baraka ask one of his aides what time his press conference started. “9:50,” the aide said. Baraka responded, “9:50?!” before adding an expletive.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Welcome to The Topline, a weekly roundup of the big numbers driving the Minnesota news cycle, as well as the smaller ones that you might have missed. This week: health coverage losses due to congressional Republicans’ cuts; UnitedHealth in free fall; the young children dying to fentanyl; EPA funding to clean up polluted sites; and a bad year for rail.
Tens of thousands of Minnesotans on verge of losing health insurance
Roughly 150,000 Minnesotans would lose health insurance under congressional Republicans’ plan to cut funding for Medicaid and other social services, according to an estimate released last week by Democrats on the Senate Joint Economic Committee.
Roughly 110,000 of those losses would come from Medicaid cuts, with an additional 40,000 losing coverage due to cuts to Affordable Care Act funding. 
All told, roughly 13.7 million Americans would lose health insurance coverage under the spending proposals currently being debated in Washington. The numbers are derived from an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Under those proposals, any cost savings from the reduced Medicaid and ACA spending would be more than offset by expanded tax cuts, primarily benefiting the rich. 
On net, the GOP tax bill is currently expected to add roughly $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.
UnitedHealth is having a very bad year
Minnesota-based UnitedHealth, one of the largest corporations in the U.S., has shed roughly half its value on the stock market in the past month.
In the past week alone, CEO Andrew Witty stepped down, and the Wall Street Journal reported the company is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department over potential Medicare fraud.
UnitedHealth is one of just 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, so its ongoing slide is having a disproportionate impact on perceptions of the economy’s health. The overall Dow is up roughly 5% over the same period UnitedHealth has fallen by half.
The company received national attention and scrutiny after the murder last year of Brian Thompson, an executive in charge of its health insurance division. The company has also been the subject of an ongoing investigation by health and medicine news organization STAT over its use of unregulated algorithms to deny patients care and juice profits.
Fentanyl has killed 23 Minnesota kids under the age of 8
A KARE 11 investigation finds that since 2000, 23 Minnesota infants and children under the age of eight have been killed by accidental fentanyl ingestion. 
The investigation details the story of one fentanyl-addicted mother who left out foil containing residue that her one-year-old daughter ingested. That mother was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and sentenced to two years in prison, plus additional time on supervised release.
Nationwide, accidental pediatric fentanyl exposures are rising: The nation’s poison control centers report there were 120 exposures in 2020, and 539 by 2023. Not all exposures are lethal, but the drug’s high potency means that the ingestion of even a minuscule amount can pose a threat to a child’s life.
Pre-natal exposure, when an infant is exposed to illicit substances in utero due to the mother’s drug use, is also a problem, with more than 1,100 cases in Minnesota in 2023 (drug-specific breakdowns aren’t available in the data, which come from the federal government).
EPA awards more than $2 million to clean up polluted sites in Minnesota
The Environmental Protection Agency recently announced $2.2 million in funding to clean up contaminated sites in Minnesota. The sites include a former landfill in Duluth, as well locations in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Willmar and Cass Lake.
“The $267 million in Brownfield grants will transform contaminated properties into valuable spaces for businesses and housing, creating new opportunities that strengthen local economies and directly benefit American families,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.
The federal agency recently cancelled tens of millions in grants for environmental justice initiatives in Minnesota and other Midwestern states.
The Northern Lights Express is on the ropes
Minnesota lawmakers voted over the weekend to pull $77 million in funding from the proposed Northern Lights Express rail line to Duluth and direct it toward unemployment insurance costs for hourly school workers. 
The project, which lawmakers initially funded in 2023, had been dependent on federal funds to move forward. Those funds never came through, and the current budget crunch in St. Paul made the previously-earmarked funds irresistible to lawmakers looking to plug holes elsewhere.
House Republican Transportation Chair Jon Koznick spiked the football: “With the House and Senate voting to shift a significant amount of the state’s share of the project’s funding, the Northern Lights Express train is effectively dead, and taxpayers are better off because of it.”
Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, said on the Senate floor on Sunday she’s holding out hope that it will happen one day.
“Although we are making a substantial cancellation because of this austerity that is being imposed upon the people of Minnesota … the Northern Lights Express project is still alive,” McEwen said.
It’s been a tough year for rail: several months ago the Metropolitan Council and the Minnesota Department of Transportation announced plans to convert the struggling Northstar rail line to bus service.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 11:14:03.142028

A major affordable housing redevelopment is underway in Newark as officials broke ground last week on the George Read Village project, a $26.6 million initiative that will bring 72 affordable housing units to the city, including 18 new homes.
“It is my hope that this is just the beginning of a new era of commitment to this great need. It shows what can be accomplished when dedicated visionaries work hard and long toward a common goal for the good of a community and its deserving people,” said Marene Jordan, executive director of the NHA.
The project, led by the NHA in partnership with developer Ingerman, will replace an aging residential structure along Main Street with a modern, mid-rise, mixed-use building and five new family cottages.
The new units will be available to households earning between 30% and 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI), aiming to meet the needs of low-income families in a city known for its student-dominated housing market.

Nikki Lane, chair of the NHA Board of Commissioners, noted the project’s importance in balancing the city’s housing landscape.
“This project will not only improve the need for affordable housing, it will enhance the diversity of the City of Newark, which is a unique college town with a strong emphasis on student housing,” she said. “Developing for individuals and families is refreshing,”
The redevelopment has received a wide range of funding support, including:

$5.39 million from the Delaware State Housing Authority
$3.985 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) funds
$1 million in New Castle County HOME program funds
$431,000 from the city of Newark
$1.06 million in Low Income Housing Tax Credits, generating roughly $10 million in equity

“This redevelopment of George Read Village shows what can happen with collaboration, investments and vision. Bringing 18 new units to this area of Newark will have a meaningful impact on the community and address our critical housing supply issues,” said Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) Director Matthew Heckles.
New Castle County Executive Marcus Henry called the project “a commitment to the people we serve,” emphasizing its role in providing safe and dignified housing.
David Holden, Development Principal at Ingerman, credited strong community support and partnerships for helping the project reach this stage.
“After much success with The Willows at Alder Creek, Ingerman is thrilled to partner once again with the Newark Housing Authority to bring additional high-quality affordable housing to the people of Newark,” Holden said. “We could not have reached this important milestone without the community’s support and our collaboration with the DSHA, city leadership and staff who share our vision to expand and improve the City’s affordable housing offerings,”
Construction is now underway, with officials hopeful the new development will serve as a model for future affordable housing projects across the state.
“The Newark Housing Authority is greatly appreciative to all those who contributed their time, efforts, talents and funds in bringing this to a reality,” Jordan said. “It is my belief that this will not be the last project and groundbreaking event for a deserving group in our community and the Newark Housing Authority will always be steadfast in its goal of greater achievements.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/65a79b049c8bf.image_.jpg,,,2025-05-19 12:22:33.389506

A Republican reconciliation bill still being negotiated in the U.S. House contains various proposed changes to Medicaid — among them work reporting requirements — to pay for an extension of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. A preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimate found over 8 million people nationally could lose coverage under the House legislation.
The work requirements would apply to adults on Medicaid between ages 19 and 64, requiring them to report at least 80 hours of work per month or qualify for an exception. The exemptions include people with disabilities, caregivers and pregnant participants.
A report from the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation published last month found between 84,000 and 96,000 Missourians ages 19 to 64 could lose coverage under the plan. Another report, from the left-leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities published last week, estimated a reduction of 91,000 Missourians. 
The CBPP analysis found that although 28% of Missouri Medicaid participants in the adult-expansion group could lose coverage, only 8% of participants in the adult-expansion group didn’t work in the last year and don’t qualify for an exemption — meaning thousands of eligible participants would lose coverage.
U.S. House panel passes GOP plan that cuts Medicaid by $625B, adds work requirement

Work requirements in the current version of the legislation would go into effect in 2029, though there are reports Republicans are considering moving up the timeline.
States would be required to monitor compliance and ensure those with exceptions don’t get kicked off. Participants would need to navigate red tape to prove they’re working or exempt. 
New bureaucratic hurdles could prove especially problematic in Missouri, which has historically fared poorly with administration of its public assistance programs. Missouri’s social services agency has struggled to meet federal standards for processing Medicaid applications and is being sued for its administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Administrative issues — such as long call center wait times, application delays and paperwork issues — routinely cause Missourians who are eligible for benefits to be incorrectly booted from benefit programs.
At a legislative hearing for a proposed work requirement in Missouri earlier this year, opponents said work requirements on Medicaid would only exacerbate the social service agency’s call center wait times and staffing issues.
One in five Missourians is enrolled on Medicaid. Most adults on Medicaid are already working or would qualify for an exception, but work reporting requirements would cause many to fall through the cracks, experts say, including low-wage workers with unpredictable hours. Opponents of work requirements also say Medicaid is a crucial safety net for workers who are laid-off or fired for reasons beyond their control and lose employer-sponsored health care.
U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has been a vocal opponent of Medicaid cuts but has said he is supportive of work requirements.
“Listen, if you want to do work requirements, I’m all for that,” he told CNN last week. “I bet every Republican, and I bet most Americans would agree with that.”
Arkansas was the first state to adopt Medicaid work requirements in 2018. Until a court halted the program in 2019, over 18,000 people lost coverage, many of whom didn’t know about exemptions or couldn’t navigate the red tape. Studies found Arkansas’ policy didn’t result in increased employment.
Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program has been mired in technical issues, ProPublica has reported, and the increased requirements for state employees to verify work status have proven onerous and expensive.
Other proposed Medicaid changes in the U.S. House budget include more frequent eligibility checks, out-of-pocket copays for some enrollees and freezing the tax states levy on providers to help fund the program.

When Gov. Gavin Newsom laid out his revised state budget proposal last week, he emphasized how President Donald Trump and his administration made forecasting California’s economic future even harder. To see that chaotic uncertainty in action, all one needs to look at is the daily investment returns posted by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System.
As of Friday morning the nation’s largest public pension fund, CalPERS, has a total market value of $539 billion. But in the days following “Liberation Day,” when Trump first imposed his tariffs on April 2, CalPERS losses hovered around $25 billion. In the first two days alone, CalPERS lost $15 billion, while the stock market experienced a $6.6 trillion wipeout.
The pension fund’s bounceback from a $508 billion-low on April 7 could be attributed to Trump easing off his most severe tariffs and making a deal with China to pause the highest tariffs for 90 days. 
But more volatility is likely on the horizon: In an April board meeting, CalPERS CEO Marcie Frost said the agency is keeping its “eyes on the road ahead as we navigate all the twists and turns of the current time.”

Frost: “Global economies expand or contract for a variety of reasons. But we must prepare for the possibility that current events here in the U.S. could have a serious impact on our investment returns as of June 30 and into the fiscal year that begins after that.”

Meanwhile, Newsom described Trump’s tariff rollout as “remarkably inconsistent,” and to plug California’s $12 billion budget hole, the governor is proposing controversial shifts in funding that are drawing ire from advocates and stakeholders:

Health care: Newsom wants to use $1.6 billion from Proposition 35 — which voters approved in November to increase the pay of doctors who treat Medi-Cal patients — toward the deficit. He also wants to move $500 million initially earmarked to support family planning and women’s health care to the state’s general fund. Both proposals are getting pushback from doctors, hospitals and clinics, which argue that it is wrong to reroute money voters set aside for specific health costs.

Climate projects: In addition to extending California’s cap and trade program through 2045, Newsom wants to commit more than half of the money it generates this year, or roughly $4.8 billion, to Cal Fire operations and the High-Speed Rail Project. The cap and trade program has provided billions of dollars for projects aimed at combating climate change. Critics of Newsom’s proposal say moving the money would mean limiting resources for the state’s other environmental efforts, such as reducing emissions from gas-powered cars.

On Saturday the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office released its review of the governor’s updated state budget plan. Though it projects a $14 billion deficit, the analyst’s office considers Newsom’s “spending reductions appropriate.”

What can high school grads wear?

Two months ago, the Trump administration said it would withhold federal funding to school districts that promote diversity, equity and inclusion through clubs, activities and graduation ceremonies. Though a judge has since temporarily blocked that order and California is filing a separate lawsuit to stop the order, one state lawmaker wants to make it easier for students to wear tribal or other cultural regalia at graduation.
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, a bill by Democratic Assemblymember James Ramos of San Bernardino would eliminate the pre-approval process for students who want to wear cultural regalia — Native American or otherwise — at graduation. Native students, families and tribes say schools require notice too far in advance because students often receive their regalia on graduation day, sometimes as a gift from a grandparent or tribal elder. This can be stressful for students on graduation day, since they’re unsure whether they’ll be allowed to wear the regalia.
Jennie Rocha, who graduated from Clovis North High School last year, said she was nervous arriving at graduation because she wore a Comanche stole that the school had initially denied.

Rocha: “I wanted to wear it because I feel like everything I have is because of the Comanche. I wouldn’t be able to go to college without their support.”

But schools argue they need a pre-approval process for all students to ensure the regalia are respectful and appropriate.

Public silenced at bill hearings

As state legislators wade through the more than 2,000 bills they introduced this year, residents from across the state who travel to Sacramento to speak in support or opposition of those proposals can sometimes find themselves given just a few seconds to speak or silenced altogether, write CalMatters’ Ryan Sabalow and Hans Poschman.
In the past two months, there have been at least a dozen examples of committee leaders cutting off speakers midway through their remarks, or prohibiting them to talk at all due to time constraints. Legislators say it’s sometimes necessary to ensure hearings don’t drag into the night, while ensuring other members of the public, as well as lobbyists and advocates, get their say too. 
But for Californians who must drive hours from remote parts of the state, it can be frustrating and discouraging to have their viewpoints be rushed through the legislative process. In April, Elizabeth Washoe took a day off work to drive five hours from Modoc County to the state Capitol to speak in support of a bear-hunting bill. She was given only a few seconds to speak.

Washoe: “I would love to have more time to say something. It’s not equitable representation for rural areas.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to extend California’s landmark cap and trade program through 2045. But earmarking half of this year’s funds to the beleaguered rail project and Cal Fire would leave too little for other climate projects, critics say. 


California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to tap at least $2.5 billion from the state’s climate fund to pay for state firefighting crews and the long-troubled high-speed rail project.
In his budget proposal unveiled last week, Newsom announced that he is seeking to extend the state’s landmark cap and trade program, which is funded by credits bought and sold by major polluters, through 2045. But the allocation of the money is already triggering a fervent debate among state lawmakers.
Large polluters, such as oil refineries and power plants, pay for their greenhouse gases through a market system of auctioned credits called cap and trade. Over the past 11 years, almost $13 billion from cap and trade auctions has already been spent on electric vehicles, public transit, clean energy and other projects to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate change.
The governor’s new plan would commit $1.54 billion of the 2025-26 climate funds, and more in later years, to pay for Cal Fire’s “fire prevention, fire control, and resource management activities.” That would amount to more than a third of the state fire agency’s $4.47 billion budget, according to the governor’s proposed budget. Wildfires have grown more extreme because of climate change, straining Cal Fire’s resources.
In addition, through 2045, the governor’s plan would earmark at least $1 billion a year of the climate funds to the California high-speed rail project, which aims to connect Los Angeles to San Francisco. The project, which has been beset with construction delays, cost overruns and fights about the route for years, was allocated $407 million of cap and trade money last year.
Combined, the firefighting and high speed rail costs could consume more than half of the projected $4.8 billion that cap and trade would provide in the next fiscal year.
Newsom’s proposal to extend California’s cap-and-trade program, which expires in 2030, for 15 more years could spark one of the year’s most consequential fights in the Legislature over climate change.
The push to extend the program is bound to be contentious, particularly if Newsom seeks a two-thirds vote of the Legislature, as various groups jostle for a slice of the funding. Watchdogs, policy analysts and environmental justice advocates also have raised concerns about how the program is structured and who benefits the most.
Many legislators have already expressed concerns about the use of climate funds to pay for firefighters and high speed rail. Some lawmakers and other critics and analysts say diverting the money would mean cutting other priorities, such as the transition to electric vehicles.
“You’re going to have some tough choices,” said Helen Kerstein, who tracks the cap and trade program for the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. “You can’t add $1.5 billion — and growing — and not take anything away, at least in the near term, given current projections.”
“You’re going to have some tough choices. You can’t add $1.5 billion — and growing — and not take anything away, at least in the near term.”HELEN KERSTEIN, LEGISLATIVE ANALYST’S OFFICE
Assemblymember Lori Wilson, a Democrat from Suisun City, said she is concerned that using climate fund money to pay for Cal Fire’s activities could crowd out spending that has already been promised to reduce emissions from cars and trucks and fund mass transit.
Transportation “is the largest single source, but the hardest to decarbonize,” Wilson said. “And the whole point is to transition, which is why those investments (are) necessary.”
A coalition of environmental justice groups said the governor, by using so much money for high speed rail and general fund expenses, is leaving inadequate money “for extreme heat impacts, affordable housing, clean drinking water, and other critical environmental programs that reduce greenhouse gasses and clean up contaminated air, water and soil that pose direct threats to public health.”

The cap and trade proposal came as California faces a $12 billion budget deficit. By proposing the cap and trade extension as an addition to the budget bill, which moves  through the legislative process faster than standalone bills — Newsom could sidestep what might otherwise be a longer, more contentious climate debate.
The move links the reauthorization of the program to broader budget negotiations — boosting the governor’s leverage but reducing legislative oversight and public input.
Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, a Democrat from Irvine, protested the governor’s moves at a committee meeting on Thursday. 
“This is probably the most challenging budget situation the state of California has faced in at least the last seventeen years. We are going to be grappling with some very, very tough choices, very tough decisions,” she said. “Trying to then layer in, and shoehorn in, the reauthorization of our landmark climate cap and trade — cap and invest — program seems kind of insane to me.”
Newsom’s proposed extension of the program — which he wants to rename “cap and invest” — comes after President Donald Trump attacked it in an executive order targeting blue-state climate initiatives. The order singled out California’s cap and trade program as forcing businesses to meet “radical requirements.”
Newsom framed his cap and trade proposal in the resistance language reminiscent of clashes during the first Trump era. “California won’t bend the knee to a federal administration hellbent on making America polluted again,” Newsom said in a statement.
But some state lawmakers are already questioning key parts of the plan. Assemblymember Steve Bennett, a Democrat from Oxnard, questioned during the hearing Thursday whether revenues from cap and trade could realistically cover all of Newsom’s promises.
“So, in a sense you’re proposing more money than we’re saying we have?” Bennett, chair of the committee, asked Newsom administration officials from the state Department of Finance.
Bennett was also openly skeptical of continuing to use cap and trade money to pay for the high-speed rail project, which has ballooned to a cost of $128 billion. “We need to… make sure we don’t have a train to nowhere,” he said.
Through 2030, 25% of all cap and trade money is earmarked for high speed rail under state law. A bill in the  Assembly authored by a Republican that would eliminate that earmark has not moved forward.
“Real tracks are being laid…so I want to get (high speed rail) done. That’s our commitment. That’s why it’s still reflected in the cap and trade extension.”GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM
Newsom said at his budget briefing Wednesday that his “commitment (to high speed rail) is firm.”
“Real tracks are being laid…so I want to get it done,” Newsom said. “That’s our commitment. That’s why it’s still reflected in the cap and trade extension.”
Several other lawmakers also raised concerns about the governor’s budget math and were skeptical of relying on a funding stream that is supposed to shrink over time as California reduces its carbon emissions.
“Trying to…shoehorn in the reauthorization of our landmark climate cap and trade program (in budget negotiations) seems kind of insane to me.”ASSEMBLYMEMBER COTTIE PETRIE-NORRIS 
California Transit Association Executive Director Michael Pimentel said the governor’s plan was “silent on the importance of continued climate investment” into mass transit.
“To combat climate change, improve air quality, and address the affordability crisis faced by everyday Californians, state leaders must stand up to protect and maintain continued investment in clean, efficient, and affordable public transit projects and services,” he said.
A contentious history 
California launched its cap-and-trade program in 2013 as a key tool for slashing greenhouse gas emissions. Created under the 2006 Global Warming Solutions Act, the system set a declining cap on emissions from major polluters and allowed businesses to buy and sell permits, creating a market for emissions.
By 2017, then-Gov. Jerry Brown faced a critical inflection point. The program was set to expire in 2020, and Brown sought to extend it through 2030. But the path to reauthorization was anything but smooth.
The political lift came in securing a two-thirds vote in the Legislature, the threshold that would help inoculate the program from legal attacks, given that California voters expanded the definition of a tax in 2010.
That supermajority required bipartisan support, and Brown courted moderate Republicans with concessions: tax breaks for manufacturers, fee waivers for rural residents and spending assurances.
Newsom’s proposal would maintain many of the program’s most controversial provisions. Those include free emission permits for the oil and gas industry, a price ceiling mechanism and the use of carbon offsets, which have drawn criticism over concerns about their effectiveness. The governor’s proposal leaves most of the details up to the discretion of the Air Resources Board, which oversees the cap and trade program.
One key issue is the number of free allowances to industry, including the oil and gas industry. Newsom’s proposal could extend many of those giveaways through 2045, said climate expert Danny Cullenward, vice chair of an independent advisory cap and trade committee.
Cullenward told CalMatters that the market will likely begin shifting from a surplus of pollution permits to a scarcity. That will raise emissions reductions and state revenue, but also potentially increase consumer costs, with key decisions left to the Air Resources Board.
“It’ll bring in more money to the state, but it’ll also have higher consumer price impacts,” Cullenward said. “That’s going to be a key issue.”
The cap and trade debate is unfolding amid growing concern over affordability in California — a theme running through nearly every aspect of the state’s climate policy. A new report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office raised questions about how much the program could cost Californians. For instance, the cap and trade program could add 74 cents to the cost of gasoline if credits rise to their highest levels, amounting to about an additional $700 a year for the average California household, the report said. 
Of the $12.8 billion spent so far, nearly $9.2 billion has been invested in projects that benefit disadvantaged communities that are designated as a priority, according to the air board. 
The cap and trade debate is unfolding amid growing concern over affordability in California — a theme running through nearly every aspect of the state’s climate policy.
But environmental justice advocates have long criticized the program for failing to reduce local pollution in those communities, which often bear the cost of higher gasoline prices, too. Because cap and trade allows companies to comply with greenhouse gas limits by buying credits, they can continue operating in low-income neighborhoods without reducing emissions there.
Advocacy groups have asked the Legislature to reject a plan similar to the governor’s that would largely leave the program unchanged.
“Our communities, who bear the disproportionate burden of some of the worst air quality in the state, and the nation, are also predominantly communities of color,” Connie Cho, senior policy advisor for the Asian Pacific Environmental Network, said at a state Senate hearing earlier this month.
“We believe it is not only possible, but absolutely necessary, to achieve and balance all three: climate, health equity and affordability through the cap and trade program as the cost of living rises to a fever pitch.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/102023-High-Speed-Rail-LV_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

The cost of the low-income health insurance program has been growing rapidly.,"In summary
Newsom’s Medi-Cal budget plan would shift money for voter-approved increases in doctors’ pay and reproductive care to cover other expenses. The cost of the low-income health insurance program has been growing rapidly.




Six months after California voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative that increases the pay of doctors treating Medi-Cal patients, Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to divert that money to cover other health costs.
Newsom last week proposed using $1.6 billion generated by Proposition 35 over the next two years to help address California’s $12 billion state deficit. The governor said the spending plan is allowable under the ballot measure, while doctors, hospitals, clinics and others who support the measure are crying foul.
Rising costs are making Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance for low-income people, unsustainable, triggering a controversy over use of funds that voters earmarked for specific health costs, such as doctor’s pay and women’s reproductive health.
In addition to reallocating the Prop. 35 funds, the governor also wants to move $500 million from the state tobacco tax into the state’s general fund. That money, which voters approved in a 2016 ballot measure, is supposed to support family planning and women’s health care, among other services. 
Health advocates say the governor’s proposals for shifting the money will weaken the state’s health safety net and hamstring reproductive health care.
Planned Parenthood said the double hit from Newsom’s Prop. 35 and tobacco tax proposals in the state budget could cripple its services. 
Jodi Hicks, chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and co-chair of the Yes on Prop. 35 campaign, called Newsom’s proposal “shocking” and “plain cruel.” She said Planned Parenthood would lose a third of its budget if it is approved by the Legislature next month. Low-income patients would have to contend with longer wait times, fewer appointment options and potentially need to drive further to access care. 
“Our footprint is so large in sexual and reproductive health care in California. There is no way for other clinics to absorb that,” Hicks said.
Newsom’s proposal comes at a time when the Republican-led Congress is contemplating deep cuts to Medicaid. Included is cutting off all federal funding for Planned Parenthood. (Medi-Cal is California’s name for Medicaid.) “We need the state to help us prepare, not make things significantly worse,” Hicks said. 
“Our footprint is so large in sexual and reproductive health care in California. There is no way for other clinics to absorb that.”Jodi Hicks, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California 
The use of state health funds will likely be a centerpiece as the state Legislature negotiates a budget deal with Newsom over the next month. A final budget is due June 15. 
The state’s Democratic lawmakers, who have a supermajority in the Legislature, have largely balked at Newsom’s changes to Medi-Cal, which also include freezing new enrollment for most adults without permanent legal status.
“I’m disheartened that the Governor’s updated budget is riddled with deep cuts to our constituents’ healthcare. We cannot boast about having the fourth-largest economy while balancing our budget on the back of everyday Californians’ healthcare,” Assembly Health Committee Chair Mia Bonta, a Democrat from Oakland, said in a statement.
Is it legal to move Prop. 35 funds?
Prop. 35, approved by 68% of California voters in November, was designed to guarantee doctors would get paid more to serve patients covered by Medi-Cal. Reimbursement rates for Medi-Cal are so low that patients often struggle to find doctors who will accept their insurance. 
Prop. 35 uses a special tax paid by health insurance plans to generate revenue for Medi-Cal. Most of the money — $9 billion in 2024-25 — goes to the state’s general fund. But the additional $1.6 billion that Newsom wants to take for general Medi-Cal spending was supposed to be reserved to increase the amount doctors get paid for specific services, such as primary care, specialty care and emergency room visits.  
Newsom’s budget proposal would instead use the $1.6 billion intended for doctors’ pay increases to support higher Medi-Cal spending for primary care, specialty care, ambulances and hospital outpatient procedures. 
Planned Parenthood and the California Medical Association helped lead the industry group that put the measure on the ballot. 
In a statement, Dr. Shannon Udovic-Constant, president of the medical association, called Newsom’s budget proposal a “direct violation of the will of California voters.”
“The proposition was passed to prevent exactly this kind of maneuver – raiding health care funding to solve budget problems,” she said.

When questioned about the move during a budget presentation on Wednesday, Newsom denied this characterization and said the proposed spending is “absolutely consistent” with the rules established by the ballot measure. 
Newsom repeatedly blamed Prop. 35 for causing part of the state’s budget shortfall and called it and other recent ballot measures “unfunded initiatives.” 
The governor said Medi-Cal has a growth problem that the state cannot afford. 
State spending on Medi-Cal has more than doubled since 2017 and is now projected to cost $76.8 billion in the 2024-25 budget year. Earlier this year lawmakers approved an extra $6 billion for unexpected Medi-Cal costs.

Linnea Koopmans, chief executive of the Local Health Plans of California and chair of the Prop. 35 advisory committee, said in a statement to CalMatters that Newsom’s budget does not reflect California’s values. 
“Undoubtedly, the state budget challenge is real, but sweeping more than $1 billion of (Prop. 35) revenue is not an option. These funds must be used to support Medi-Cal investments in providers and workforce that are necessary to improve access to care,” Koopmans said. 
The Prop. 35 advisory committee was established by the ballot initiative to oversee how the state spends the money.
Industry supporters of the measure say Newsom’s proposal doesn’t actually pay doctors more; it conflates increased costs associated with Medi-Cal’s growing enrollment with payment. 
Molly Weedn, a spokesperson for the Yes on 35 campaign, said in a statement that the budget proposal raises “serious legal concerns.”
“The Governor proposes using Prop. 35 funding to cover already incurred costs in Medi-Cal and not for increasing provider payments to increase access to health care,” Weedn said.
The most contentious part of the debate comes down to whether he’s using the Prop. 35 money to pay the state’s general expenses, not just health care. 
The Newsom administration’s finance department said in a document shared with CalMatters that doctors’ pay is reviewed and increased annually, which aligns with Prop. 35’s requirements. The department also denies that using the money to pay for Medi-Cal would replace general fund spending because the amount that the state is taking from the general fund for Medi-Cal continues to grow. 
Critics say these standard adjustments are not necessarily a true rate increase for doctors — they mostly reflect increased Medi-Cal costs as a result of more patients enrolling or more expensive care being provided. In order to substantially increase how much doctors get paid, the state would have to submit an application for federal approval, which it has not done.
“It appears the caseload growth in Medi-Cal is being used to justify the need for these funds,” said Jennifer Kent, an advisor to the Prop. 35 campaign and former director of the health care services department. 
Newsom isn’t the first governor to sweep money approved by voters into the general fund, and his budget proposal also mirrors a move made by his predecessor, Jerry Brown, in 2017 to eliminate payments made for family planning, women’s health and dentistry by the state tobacco tax.
Amy Moy, co-chief executive of Essential Access Health, which provides grants to clinics for reproductive health care, said the governor’s proposed cuts jeopardize California’s commitment to making abortion, contraceptives and other reproductive health services accessible. 
Moy, a member of the Proposition 35 stakeholder advisory committee, said she is confident the final budget approved by the Legislature will pull back some of Newsom’s proposed cuts. 
“Ultimately we believe that California’s commitment, including our administration’s commitment, to sexual and reproductive health will be reflected in the final budget.”

California lawmakers cut them off,Ryan Sabalow and Hans Poschman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/05/california-legislature-silenced-public-hearings/,"As lawmakers rush through thousands of bills in Sacramento and make decisions in secret, regular Californians are often silenced.","In summary
As lawmakers rush through thousands of bills in Sacramento and make decisions in secret, regular Californians are often silenced.


Landon Morrison, a recovering addict, wanted to tell California lawmakers why they should support legislation he believes will hold troubled drug and alcohol treatment centers accountable.
He was told he would only get two minutes to speak, so he spent hours writing and rehearsing exactly what he wanted to say. But after getting on the road at 4 a.m. for the six-hour drive to Sacramento from Los Angeles County, Morrison didn’t get to say a single word because previous speakers talked for too long.
The committee’s Democratic chairperson, Sen. Caroline Menjivar of Van Nuys, ended testimony in support of the bill after five minutes.
“In a way, this kind of articulated the stigma of addiction. … I’m at the bottom of the line, you know?” Morrison said. “It was just kind of very disheartening.”
Morrison’s experience is hardly unique in the California Legislature as lawmakers try to jam through the more than 2,000 bills lawmakers have introduced so far this year. Over the past two months, CalMatters journalists witnessed more than a dozen examples of committee leaders cutting speakers off midway through their remarks or prohibiting them from talking at all because other people went over the few minutes that members of the public are given to testify.
Lawmakers say the rules are necessary to accommodate the armies of paid lobbyists, political activists and members of the public who flood the Capitol each year to jockey for and against legislation. Lawmakers say they do their best to ensure everyone gets their say while aiming to keep hearings from dragging on well into the night.  
“Some bills you get dozens of people. Some bills you get over 100 people,” said Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Democrat representing the Palo Alto area who oversees the Business and Professions Committee. “There is a real attempt to be fair on both sides and to everybody.”
The public comment limits are yet another symptom of lawmakers rushing through thousands of bills in the few months they’re in session in Sacramento – and usually waiting until right before key deadlines to push through the largest volume of bills.
‘Me too’ speakers get only seconds
To try to fit in all those wishing to speak, most members of the public who show up at the Capitol can only express their positions through what’s known as the “me too” portion of a hearing.
After the lead witnesses in support or opposition of a bill each get to deliver two minutes of testimony, others approach the microphone and state their name, organization and whether they support or oppose it. In 2023, legislative leaders stopped allowing people to offer their comments remotely via Zoom as they had during the pandemic.

Lobbyists and other insiders usually know the drill and keep their “me toos” to a couple of seconds so the committee leaders don’t cut them off. 
But regular people who might not be familiar with the process regularly get shut down if they speak beyond a few seconds.
That happened to Albert Titman, Sr., a Native American man from the Sacramento area. He came to the Assembly Business and Professions Committee in late April to tell lawmakers why they should oppose a cannabis tax bill he thinks would harm disadvantaged tribal communities. 
But he wasn’t designated as a lead witness, so when he tried to speak during the “me too” portion of the hearing, Berman, the committee chairperson, told him to wrap it up.
“Now we’re just at the name, organization and position,” Berman reminded him as Titman grew frustrated.
“There’s not one Native person here,” Titman shot back. “Not one Native person.”
Capitol security ushered Titman away from the mic.
“They shut me down, just pretty much telling me to shut up, you know?” Titman said in an interview. “I wanted to actually sit up there and present my argument, but they wouldn’t allow me.”
Berman said later that he “felt very bad” for how things went with Titman, and he noted he did give Titman a little more time than the other “me too” speakers had. But Berman said he was obligated to keep the hearing moving. If a committee runs too long, it can delay the subsequent committees scheduled to use the same room.“I try to have a little flexibility, but you can’t let somebody talk for, you know, a minute who’s really just supposed to be providing their name, organization or affiliation and support or opposition to the bill,” he said. “Every time is a dance, and it’s not easy.”
Kathi Zollinger, a volunteer with the Lake Tahoe-based BEAR League, didn’t have security called on her last month when she approached the mic and tried to say why she opposed a  bear-hunting bill.
But she was still taken aback when Diane Papan, the Democratic chairperson of the Assembly Parks and Wildlife Committee, cut her off mid-sentence.

“I thought it was kind of rude,” she said afterward. Papan, who represents the San Mateo area, didn’t respond to an interview request.
One of the bear bill’s supporters, Elizabeth Washoe, took a day off work, filled up her vehicle with $5-plus a gallon gas before she left Modoc County and made the five-hour drive to the capital, only to be given a few seconds at the mic. 
In an interview, she said that as a Native American woman from a rural area, she left feeling that those living in the far reaches of the state have a harder time having their voices heard.
“I would love to have more time to say something,” she said. “It’s not equitable representation for rural areas.”
Democrat blocks comment on transgender bill 
Some people who get cut off believe it’s because a committee chair doesn’t like what they have to say. Opponents of a bill to allow transgender people to more easily change their names say that happened to them when the proposal was before the Assembly Health Committee on April 29.
The committee’s chairperson, Mia Bonta, a Democrat from Oakland, refused to give the lead witnesses for opponents their two minutes each. Bonta told them they hadn’t properly registered in advance.“I was very clear and the rules that the Health Committee adopted indicated that we needed to have registered opposition offering witness testimony,” she said. “And I reiterated that at the beginning of this hearing, and those are the rules of this committee.”
But the bill’s opponents said they could find no reference to the rules online. 
After driving from San Francisco to testify, Erin Friday, president of the group Our Duty, was furious. 
“Welcome to China,” she said. Another organization called Californians for Good Governance later filed a formal complaint over how the opponents were treated.
Bonta’s spokesperson, Daniel McGreevy, said in an email that Bonta’s actions were “consistent with updated guidelines which are established and read at the top of all recent hearings.”
In an interview, Friday said she regularly testifies in other states on similar legislation. She said no other state she’s been to is as restrictive about public comment in hearings. 
“I’m a lifelong Democrat, so I find it really quite amusing when (California Democrats) talk about Republicans not wanting to play by the rules, or constitutional chaos, when we have no voice whatsoever,” said Friday, whose organization believes there “is no such thing as a transgender child.” 
Are hearings mostly political theater?
After CalMatters highlighted last year the consequences of rushing through too many bills at the last minute, legislative leaders slightly lowered the amount of bills each lawmaker could introduce during the two-year session that began in December. It’s helped a little. At the bill filing deadline earlier this year, lawmakers had introduced 2,278 bills – down from 2,640 at the start of the last session.
The committees are still jam-packed, such as in late April, as lawmakers butted up against a deadline to advance their measures. Two Senate Judiciary Committee hearings discussed a combined 106 bills. One of those hearings went 11 hours. The final votes weren’t tallied until almost 11 p.m.

The public comment limits also underscore another problem that CalMatters has pointed out. The Democrats who control the Capitol often make their decisions behind closed doors.
It’s a trend reflected in the Digital Democracy database. Last session, just 25 bills failed because a majority of lawmakers voted “no ” during a committee hearing or a floor session. Plenty of bills still die — 2,403 of them were killed during the last two-year session — but they’re almost always spiked through secretive procedural tactics that leave the public with little way of knowing who is responsible.
Critics say that makes commenting in hearings mostly performative since it’s so rare for bills to be killed in public.
San Diego Republican Assemblymember Carl DeMaio says he doesn’t bother bringing witnesses to testify because he knows what they say won’t change anyone’s mind — and there’s a good chance they won’t get to say all they came to say anyway. It’s “all theater,” he said. “That’s irrelevant, because these politicians basically do their deals in back rooms, and they walk into the hearing already decided.”
Other ways to influence legislation
Legislators and Capitol insiders say people can influence legislation before committee hearings in plenty of other ways. Anyone can submit formal remarks on individual bills through the Legislature’s online position letter portal. 
They can also write or call lawmakers’ offices and request meetings with them or their staff, or speak to the politicians when they do events in their district, which can be more effective than showing up at a hearing whose outcome could be predetermined. 
Lobbyist Jennifer Fearing says she tells advocates that if they really want to be heard, facetime with a lawmaker in their district is best.
“You don’t have to change the whole system up here (in Sacramento) to have that kind of impact,” Fearing said. “A minute in a hearing is not a substitute for a relationship at home.” 
For Morrison, a recovering addict, the trip to Sacramento wasn’t a total loss. 
Sen. Tom Umberg, the bill’s author, felt badly that Morrison got cut off and arranged for him to speak on a related measure.
Umberg, a Democrat representing the Santa Ana area, said it was the least he could do for a “civilian” — his term for those who aren’t paid advocates. As chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he said he tries to prioritize bills with more “civilian” speakers.
Still, Morrison said that while Umberg treated him well, the experience was a letdown. 
He thought testifying would be “an honor and a prestige.” Instead, “It’s like well, no, that’s really not that big a deal,” he said. “They slap you to the side.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031224_Happiness-Comittee_FG_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

Jordan Haedtler is a climate financial policy strategist with Climate Cabinet and a former legislative staffer in the state Assembly.


Climate change has thrown insurance markets into dysfunction, and the situation is about to get more dire. As the epicenter of a global insurance crisis, it is critical that California formulates a strong response. 
Creating and funding public catastrophe models, like the one called for in California’s Senate Bill 429, is a good start. It seeks a model that would help regulators, insurers and others assess wildfire risk and future losses.
Under the Trump administration, the federal government is abandoning its responsibility to support communities facing climate catastrophe. It’s shifting costs onto state governments by gutting FEMA and slashing funding for crucial weather data and climate adaptation. Many businesses, including insurance companies, rely heavily on this data. These harmful federal cuts are leaving the public vulnerable.
Public catastrophe models like the one proposed in SB 429 can serve as a check on the proprietary “black box” risk prediction models insurers use to justify rate increases and to conceal information from customers about how to reduce risk.
California has smartly invested billions of dollars in wildfire mitigation over the past decade. Insurers should be required to factor that into their underwriting.
Unfortunately a bill requiring them to do so stalled in the California Senate last session, exacerbating concerns over whether Californians will be able to access the insurance market after January’s devastating wildfires.
Public catastrophe models can help solve these problems. By providing greater transparency around modeling, they can blunt the negative fallout of our insurance crisis for consumers. By collecting sophisticated, granular information about climate risk, these public models can help inform and drive greater public investment in climate resilience. 
This data can be used to inform government investments in risk reduction, such as ecological forest management and floodplain management, which will likely make insurance markets much healthier over time. 
Without a public alternative, the proprietary models used by insurance companies are what we are left with.
There is little information about the inputs used in these private models, and they have been shown to have big flaws. Analyses of some of the most commonly used proprietary risk modelers from insurance companies have revealed glaring inconsistencies that could increase costs for Californians and elevate the risks for homeowners.
In a March report outlining a road to recovery from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers at UCLA and the University of Southern California called for more reliable data and stronger coordination between government agencies, the insurance sector and individual households. They argued for substantial investments in climate resilience and urged that those investments be incorporated into insurance models. 
A public catastrophe model would be useful in supporting all of that work. It would also help guarantee that Californians see the benefits of the mitigation investments they are making through more widely available and affordable insurance policies. 
During the Biden administration, the Federal Insurance Office recommended that state insurance offices build a platform to collaborate on catastrophe model data and methodology. Biden’s White House even floated the concept of a national catastrophe model to host that effort. 
Trump is now dismantling all of the federal agencies that might have housed such a platform, while also failing to act on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s request for federal aid for the L.A. wildfires. 
With the federal government no longer a reliable partner, it is more important than ever that states like California take the lead in protecting consumers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_37.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end, too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
 

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states 

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
  Creating a new food system 

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
 

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

This reporting was supported by the International Women’s Media Foundation’s Fund for Indigenous Journalists: Reporting on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, Two Spirit and Transgender People (MMIWG2T).









On a summer evening in 2019, a man living in a hilltop house in the Navajo community of Nenahnezad called 911 to report a body in the dirt road in front of his home.“The guy is not breathing, nothing,” he told the operator.
The person he discovered was Kyle Jackson, a 31-year-old citizen of the Navajo Nation.
Kyle had fought with another man at a nearby house hours before his body was found, according to witness interviews by law enforcement. Severely injured, Kyle was kicked out of the house. It’s unclear how long he lay in the road before dying, but at least one other person passed by without stopping to help him, about six hours before the call to police.
In the following weeks, his mother, Colleen Harrison Jackson, visited the spot where his body was found and spoke with the 911 caller, along with some of his friends who had been with him in the days leading up to his death.

She put her faith in the Navajo Department of Criminal Investigations and the FBI — one of the agencies on the case because Kyle’s body was found on the reservation. Over the next few years, she called investigators from both agencies for updates. They would get back to her sometimes, but not always. She also reached out to an FBI victim specialist, who would tell her the investigators were still working on the case, so she remained hopeful they would eventually make an arrest.
Then she got the letter.
The FBI had closed its investigation, the specialist wrote to Colleen in March 2022.
The letter provided a nine-word explanation: The United States Attorney’s Office had declined to prosecute.
Standing in front of the post office, Colleen cried as she read those words.
“No one called me and said, ‘We’re going to close this case, this is why.’ No one called me,” she said. “I just get this letter, and I was very upset because I didn’t know what happened. I really just broke down.”
To this day, no one has been tried for killing Kyle.
Colleen isn’t alone. She’s one of thousands who have lost loved ones to a national crisis of Indigenous people disproportionately dying of homicide or going missing.
Infrequent updates from law enforcement, many affected families say, have intensified the pain they’re already feeling. That was one of the key findings of the federal Not Invisible Act Commission, which, in a 2023 report, made numerous recommendations aimed at police and prosecutors improving the way they communicate with families.
In an interview with New Mexico In Depth last year, former U.S. Attorney for the District of New Mexico Alexander Uballez and two prosecutors in the office’s Indian Country Crimes section acknowledged the harm done to families when the federal government delivers difficult news about their loved ones’ cases through the mail.
During his tenure, which began in May 2022, the office established a policy of updating families in person when possible, according to Uballez.
A Not Invisible Act Commission member says that’s a step in the right direction.
But Uballez, who announced his run for Albuquerque mayor in April, has since resigned at the request of President Donald Trump.
The new U.S. attorney for the district, Ryan Ellison, didn’t answer a question about whether the policy Uballez described will remain, but said in an email that prosecutors working closely with families is important.
Growing up in northwestern New Mexico, Kyle spent time playing along the San Juan River, fishing at a nearby dam with his grandpa, and helping take care of his siblings and cousins. He was an avid reader and enjoyed working on science projects for school fairs.
His childhood love of the outdoors continued into adulthood, and he often went on hikes and camping trips. In 2016, he graduated from San Juan College with an associate of applied science degree in the college’s industrial maintenance mechanic program.
Kyle “never let things get him down,” Colleen said, and looked out for others. As a teenager, he urged his mom to let friends who had unstable home lives stay with their family, she said.
A former girlfriend, Christa Perez, first met Kyle when they were in high school. They reconnected over a decade later and started dating. Perez is a single mom with three kids and was struggling at the time, she said.
“If it wasn’t for Kyle, I think I’d still be drinking. I’d still be lost,” Perez said. “He was there for me no matter what.”
He taught her kids how to play a card game, and to this day, Perez said, they ask, “Are we going to play Kyle’s cards or regular cards?”
They broke up about a year before his death but kept in touch, up until the week he died.
A violent evening
Colleen shared with New Mexico In Depth a Shiprock police incident report, the letter she received from the FBI in 2022, and a report of findings from the University of New Mexico’s Office of the Medical Investigator, which found Kyle had died of blunt head trauma. The news organization obtained the recording of the 911 call and dispatch log from San Juan County, along with records maintained by the FBI, primarily summaries of witness interviews from which names have been redacted.
On the night of Friday, June 21, at about 9 p.m., Kyle and two other people went to a nearby store to pick up alcohol. Later that night, he ended up at a house in Nenahnezad, where, according to the witness interviews, he and another man fought.
Kyle “may have been struck with a hammer,” according to the report of findings. He then “moved about the home, bleeding on various surfaces, before being kicked out” early Saturday morning with facial and skull fractures.
At about noon on Saturday, a man driving to visit a friend in the area saw Kyle lying in the road, he later told a Navajo criminal investigator. The man believed Kyle, who appeared to have been “beaten badly,” was dead. He continued up the road and saw busted windows on the house he intended to visit.  Not wanting to get involved, he turned around.
When he drove past Kyle again to leave the area, he was “moving around a little bit.” The man “was afraid the guy might get up and turn on him,” so he drove off just as it began to rain.
Trying to make sense of why the man didn’t help Kyle, Colleen said she thinks people in her community are hesitant to call law enforcement because they’re skeptical arrests will come out of it, and there are fears about retaliation.
The 911 call didn’t come in until about 6:30 p.m. that day.
The caller told the operator he had just arrived home from Farmington when he found Kyle’s body in the road out front.
“Does he look to be beyond any help?” the operator asked.
“Nope, nope, not even breathing, nothing,” the caller said. “He looks—he got hit or something. There’s a hole in the side of his temple.”
Emergency medical services and then officers with the Navajo Nation’s Shiprock Police District arrived over the next 40 minutes. Several other people later arrived at the scene, a police officer wrote in his report, including Kyle’s grandmother, who asked to see his body.
At about the same time, Colleen was a few miles away, hosting a birthday party for her daughter. She learned about her son’s death later that night from his grandmother.
“I knew something was wrong already. I could feel it,” Colleen said. “And when she told me, I don’t even know what happened after that. I couldn’t even breathe.”
The letter
Early on in the investigation, the family was told there was a suspect, and the suspect’s arrest might be on the news in another week, Colleen said.
Weeks turned into months, though, and that never happened. But when Colleen would call for updates, an FBI victim specialist would sometimes get back to her and say investigators were still working on the case.
So the letter — dated March 17, 2022, nearly three years after Kyle’s death — came as a shock.
The FBI had closed its investigation because the U.S. Attorney’s Office had declined to prosecute, the victim specialist wrote. The decision didn’t “lessen the important contribution” Colleen made to the investigation, the letter reads, and her “assistance and cooperation were greatly appreciated.”
Colleen called the Navajo criminal investigator and asked him to explain.
The investigator arranged a meeting with the FBI agent. During that sit-down, which Colleen remembers happening about four months after she received the letter, they told her there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute.
They said the case could be reopened if another witness came forward, Colleen said.
That was almost three years ago. There have been no updates since.
In a late February interview, Uballez, the former U.S. attorney, wouldn’t talk about Kyle’s case, saying the office typically doesn’t comment on investigations, whether they’re open or closed. But he spoke more generally about how a federal prosecutor decides whether to file charges. (Uballez was sworn into office in May 2022, two months after Colleen received the letter from the FBI.)
FBI agents assigned to a case, Uballez said, can “procedurally, look at it themselves” and decide to not refer it for prosecution. Or “they could look at it and say, either, ‘We’re sort of on the fence and we want you guys to make the call,’ or, ‘We think there’s a charge there,’” Uballez said.
Federal prosecutors then evaluate whether there were any constitutional rights violations and whether they think a case could be proven to a jury, he said.
“It’s a different calculus,” Uballez said. “Even though we may agree we know who did this, what happened, it doesn’t mean that we should charge.”
In the dark
In 2023, the federal Not Invisible Act Commission heard testimony from at least 260 people who have lost loved ones to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people or survived human trafficking. The commission visited seven cities, including Albuquerque.
One of the major themes from the hearings, the commission wrote in a report published in October that year, was that “authorities at all levels must improve communications with family members, who are too often left in the dark for days, weeks, or months about the investigation.”
“Tragically, a case may be declared ‘cold’ without a family receiving any information about the investigation,” the report reads.
Asked what has stuck with her most from the hearings, Amber Kanazbah Crotty, a commission member and Navajo Nation Council delegate, said families’ disappointment with law enforcement either communicating with them infrequently or in ways that don’t feel compassionate.
“They’re dealing with their missing relative, or there may have been violence, a homicide or a criminal element to their case, but with the lack of communication from law enforcement, it just adds on another layer of, they don’t feel that their relatives mattered,” Crotty said in an April interview.
Instead of mailing a family a piece of paper informing them their relative’s case has been closed, she said, the commission recommended “a warm hand off.”
“It’s not the U.S. attorney themselves, but at least a victim advocate to be there to answer any questions they have, and they’re then referring them or connecting them to community resources like behavioral health, mental health support groups, so they’re not feeling like this is only happening to them and nobody cares about their relatives,” Crotty said.
Improving communication
The Justice Department since 2010 has required every U.S. Attorney’s Office with tribal lands in its district to develop an operational plan for addressing public safety in Indian country.
“A trauma-informed approach both considers the emotional impact on victims and their families and is culturally sensitive,” reads the New Mexico office’s plan, last updated in 2024. “The relationship between Tribal communities and the federal government is a fraught one. [Assistant U.S. attorneys] and law enforcement need to acknowledge this history and work hard to gain the trust of Tribal members who may have reasons to distrust the federal government and law enforcement based on past experiences and long histories.”
While the office can’t share all the details of an investigation or why it made a particular decision, staff have been working to do a better job of communicating with affected families, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal said during an interview last year. Neal was hired in 2023 as part of the Justice Department’s Missing or Murdered Indigenous Persons Regional Outreach Program.
One “challenge” the office identified in recent years, Neal said, was families not hearing from law enforcement for long periods of time and then receiving letters — like the one Colleen got — “out of the blue.”
In response, the office instituted a policy of giving families case updates in person when possible, Indian Country Crimes Section Supervisor Elisa Dimas said during last year’s interview.
“We’ve made it a real priority to understand the emotional impact that these cases have on families, to make sure that we go out and deliver this news in person, if we can, along with the victim advocate,” Dimas said. “Because even though we might not be pursuing a criminal case at our office, we know that there are still resources and support that we can provide, either through the victim advocates or community resources, to these families.”
That practice “came naturally to a lot of us” based on prior experience working with crime victims and their families, Uballez said in the February interview.
“What we did was expand the responsibility to include this more victim-centric, community-centric—you know, to build in time for people to build those relationships. And of course, if resources get drawn down there, either in personnel, or priorities elsewhere get expanded, that could change,” Uballez said, referring to Trump administration directives.
Asked if the in-person-when-possible policy will remain, Ellison, who was sworn in as New Mexico’s U.S. attorney on April 18, said in an email sent by spokesperson Tessa DuBerry that he understands “the importance of working with families of violent crimes to ensure there is justice for what they have suffered.”
“I encourage the prosecutors working with victims of violent crimes, including those in Indian Country, to work closely with these families as their cases proceed through federal court,” Ellison wrote.
‘All for Kyle’
In the spring before his death, Kyle gave his mother a packet of flower seeds.
Colleen enjoyed gardening, but she hadn’t done it in a long time, and the packet ended up in a drawer somewhere.
A few years ago, she was cleaning up around her house when she came across it.
“I just broke down. I remembered him giving that to me, and I said, ‘I’m going to make a garden.’ So I put flowers all over my front yard, and I’m starting on the back. Trees, flowers, and it’s growing,” she said. “It’s all for Kyle.”
Colleen has worked doggedly to find answers and get Kyle’s case reopened since receiving the letter in 2022.
She’s attended events, sometimes as far away as three hours south in Albuquerque, to ask for help from federal and tribal officials. She’s created posters with photos of her son and information about his death to take to rallies and gotten to know other Indigenous families with relatives who have been killed or gone missing. And she has repeatedly followed up with the investigators and filed records requests to try to learn more about their efforts.
She has her own theories about what happened to Kyle, but she worries she’ll never know definitively who killed her son or why they did it, let alone that they’ll face criminal charges.
“It’s a nightmare, and my family is not the same,” Colleen said. “And I don’t know how—you never come back from this. You don’t come back from it. You can adjust to it, but my life is different now, it’s just so different.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/nmindepthmay191-1024x763.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

It and other waterways raged out of their banks in overnight flash flooding, only to recede with debris strewn about.
County commissioners huddled inside the courthouse, one block from a muddy rodeo ring, discussing bridge inspections and the path forward. Some washed-out areas were only accessible by four-wheel drive.
They’d put up more “road closed” signs, the commissioners said, if only people would stop stealing them. 
Ozark County — estimated population 9,090 — is used to doing without. A mere nick in the Bible Belt, it doesn’t even have a stoplight.
What it does have is a 24-bed jail with a cattle trough baptismal pool in the recreational area. 
It also has an ambitious sheriff who sees his prayers answered in a new contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that could boost his $1.1 million annual budget.

“It’s a pain in the butt because this is a whole new ground that we are covering, but then, you know, when you are one of the poorest counties in the state of Missouri, I’ve got to figure out how to pay for law enforcement,” Sheriff Cass Martin told the Marshall Project – St. Louis. “And that’s not easy, especially when you can’t even get new recruits. Nobody wants to be in law enforcement. It’s dying.”
Ozark County is one of many places, big and small, that the Trump administration is depending on to pull off one of the largest mass deportations from the U.S. in recent history. An enormous ramp-up in detention capacity is underway. New contracts are being negotiated. Existing contracts with the federal government are being expanded. In the ICE contract’s infancy, Ozark County is already reaping the benefits by raising wages and hiring for new positions in law enforcement.
As of early May, tracking reports show ICE contracting with or operating 147 public and private detention facilities, including three in Missouri. That’s up from 107 facilities reported in the final days of the Biden administration. On Feb. 24, Martin signed a contract for Ozark County, which isn’t yet on the list.
ICE plans to spend $45 billion on new contracts to hold and transport detainees and provide detainee services, according to a federal request for proposals. Counties like Ozark are getting a taste in federal dollars of what that expansion means. 
Sheriffs say the feds pay well, yet the detention and transportation contracts come with much more scrutiny and oversight than typical jail work, especially in Missouri, which doesn’t have statewide jail standards. 
Still, ICE reported that eight detainees had died nationally while in custody this year, as of May 5, including one death in a rural Missouri jail that the local coroner ruled a suicide. In 2024, ICE reported 11 deaths.
Some groups that advocate for ICE detainees are concerned that people from all over the world are increasingly being held in communities without well-established legal watchdogs and medical services.
Contracting with local jails “is the easiest way to get a (detention) facility up and running without any of the risk to the federal government,” said Romelia Graefrath, co-executive director of Mariposa Legal, a nonprofit in Indianapolis that fights for immigrant rights. “The end result is people get hurt, and then that is a huge liability for these communities that are already suffering.”
 ICE detention

Martin said he applied for an ICE contract under the Biden administration when his department faced a budget crisis from falling revenue.
“We were really hurting,” he said. “We were basically praying that next month will be better.” The ICE application lay dormant until Trump was elected, he said. 
“The day after the inauguration, a federal inspector showed up here at the jail wanting to look at everything throughout the facility,” he said.
The negotiated ICE contract will breathe new life into his department at a rate of $110 a night per detainee and $1.10 per mile when transporting detainees, Martin said. 
He said Ozark County was still working out medical care so it could be cleared to hold detainees longer than overnight. Meanwhile, it has three transport vans out on the road, sometimes driving hundreds of miles per day.
He said they’ve made 525-mile runs from Ozark County to the federal building in St. Louis, down to the Greene County Jail in southwest Missouri, then back home. They’ve picked up detainees 325 miles away in Oklahoma and taken them to the tarmac at Kansas City International Airport. Sometimes detainees spend the night in the Ozark County Jail, on the way to Little Rock, Arkansas, for example, which is about a 3½-hour drive. 
“We’ll feed them, we’ll house them, we’ll take care of them, and then the next morning they’ll go back out,” Martin said. “We are just kind of a spot in the road.”
Because of the ICE contract, Martin said, he’s been able to attract more jail staff and raise the pay from about $13 to $18 an hour. In addition to mileage, he said ICE pays $18.50 an hour for drivers transporting detainees, as well as time and a half for overtime.
Martin plucked one new employee who speaks Spanish from a local real estate office. She went through a short training program to be a transport officer. 
“It definitely enlightened her a little bit,” Martin said. “They are able to talk to her and tell her if something is going on.”
The staffing bump was reflected in the public payroll. 
In February, the county paid five jail employees a total of $12,900 in earnings, which came to an average of $2,580 each. By March, it had 14 employees earning $54,193, including about $10,500 in overtime, or an average of $3,871 each. 
“We’d like to add another pod to the jail and at some point help pay livable wages,” said Brian Wise, the county clerk. “Around here, local law enforcement doesn’t have tons of money. Without extra revenue, they can’t function.”
It’s hard to gauge what local residents think. Just one attended a recent county commissioner meeting. Two years’ worth of meeting minutes didn’t mention the ICE contract in detail. Wise said he wanted to wait until federal money started coming in before listing projected revenue in the county’s $7 million annual budget.   
Other elected local officials also see the contract as a boon.  
“It’s going to work out to be a great thing for us,” Ozark County Presiding Commissioner Terry Newton said.
 Death in a Missouri jail

While cash-strapped jails see opportunity in ICE contracts, Brayan Garzón, a former street vendor in Bogotá, Colombia, saw opportunity in the United States. 
He left in 2023 and crossed the U.S. border into southern California. Garzón was then detained for three months before settling in St. Louis, where he held various odd jobs doing roofing and food deliveries, his family said.
On May 27, 2024, Garzón was arrested for shoplifting in Missouri. Two weeks later, an immigration judge in San Diego, at a hearing Garzón wasn’t present for, ordered him removed from the country, ICE officials said.
In late March, St. Louis police arrested Garzón on a charge of using a stolen credit card at a smoke shop. He was arrested along with a friend from Colombia who was accused of stealing credit cards, a watch and more than $25,000 in jewelry while cleaning hotel rooms for a temp agency, according to court records. ICE took both into custody. 
Garzón ended up being held 100 miles southwest of St. Louis in the Phelps County Jail. On March 27, a medical intake screening of Garzón at the jail noted that he had anxiety and a history of a heart murmur. He denied having suicidal thoughts. A routine mental health referral was made, according to an ICE report.
Two days later, Garzón had severe head pain, body aches and sweating. A tuberculosis test came back positive. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 at a local hospital’s emergency room after being taken there by the jail staff. He was returned to the jail a day later, on March 30, with normal vitals. But a few days later, he was treated for vomiting. His mental health appointment was rescheduled because of “mental health clinic time and staff” and his COVID-19 diagnosis.
Around 9:50 p.m. on April 7, Garzón was found near death in his cell with a blanket wrapped around his neck. He was pronounced dead the following day, after being flown to a hospital in the St. Louis area for a higher level of care, ICE said in its report. 
Garzón was in his cell alone prior to his suicide, according to Phelps County Coroner Ernie Coverdell. Garzón had given a letter to his jailers written in Spanish, requesting to speak to his mother by telephone. Coverdell said surveillance footage showed Garzón praying before entering a bottom bunk, hidden by a draped blanket. When a jailer found him unresponsive about 20 minutes later, Coverdell said Garzón looked like he was asleep, but with bedding around his neck.
Emergency responders and doctors kept his heart beating for several days after he was declared clinically dead, Coverdell said. With his family’s permission, Garzón’s heart and several organs were donated to people in need. 
“He saved more than one life,” Coverdell said. 
Garzón, one of six siblings, was 27. 
His mother, Adriana, said in Spanish that she’d spoken to her son several times by phone from the jail. He’d complained about the food and being sick, but she was blindsided by his suicide.
“My son had more will to live than to die,” she said. “He was a very happy person.”  
She struggled to comprehend how he fell through the cracks of a country rich in resources and modern technology. 
“How is it possible that my son could do this?” she said. “He’s a human being. They should have been watching.”
The Phelps County Jail has a long history of holding detainees for the federal government. In an effort to hold more, the facility just underwent a $21 million expansion that doubled the size of the jail to 400 beds.
A few weeks prior to Garzón’s arrival, Phelps County Sheriff Michael Kirn’s department was struggling to pay January and February invoices “due to lack of funds,” according to county commission meeting minutes. 
Kirn told commissioners that it was imperative to get the ICE agreement in place because he expected it to generate an additional $3.6 million a year on top of the sheriff’s typical budget of $5.5 million.
Kirn declined to comment about the death because it was under investigation by state and federal authorities. He said no policies or procedures have been changed or added since Garzón’s death. 
The county’s existing contract with the U.S. Marshals — who track down dangerous fugitives and enforce federal law — was expanded to include ICE detainees, Kirn said. He declined to share the rate. 
“The feds are a little funny about stuff, and I don’t want to cause ripples,” he said.
He said they were hovering at about 300 out of 400 beds filled, half of them with federal detainees.
“We had to slow down,” he said. “It’s not the amount of people; it’s the paperwork.” 
ICE officials didn’t respond to a request for comment. An April press release about Garzón’s death stated that the agency “remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”
 Brayan Garzón

Garzón’s death seemed to weigh on Martin, the sheriff in Ozark County. 
“He was so young,” Martin said. 
He wondered if there were any red flags leading up to the incident. And how did ICE respond?
Martin said if a jail resident is in a mental crisis in Ozark County, they rush them to the hospital for an emergency hold. That hadn’t been an issue with any of the ICE detainees they’d been transporting, he said.
“These guys are a little bit easier to deal with than our local inmates on most points,” he said. “They are, ‘Thank you, thank you for this. Thank you for food.’ They are appreciative of what we’ve got.” 
Martin said he doesn’t know all the ins and outs of why ICE detainees are in custody, but he wants to do a professional job.
“It’s not like going to the stockyard up here and watching cattle run through the chute. They are human beings,” Martin said. “My thing is, I promise that I can give them a safe place to put their head at night. I will feed them, and I will make sure that they are taken care of. And from there, wherever they are going, I hope everything turns out well for them.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EDIT_IMG_7748-e1747656541654-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

May 19: The Alabama Department of Corrections has settled over 90 lawsuits alleging corrections officers used excessive force, costing the state millions of dollars.
May 20: Even as the prison population has declined, use of force incidents in Alabama’s prisons have soared, and corrections officers involved have not only held onto jobs, but been promoted.
May 21: The anatomy of one inmate’s allegations against a corrections officer, and the aftermath.
May 22: Who’s paying for these settlements? You are. Who’s getting the most money from this litigation? Attorneys defending corrections officers.


“Don’t let these people kill me,” wrote another man from Donaldson Correctional Facility. “I’m scared for my life and that they will say I killed myself.”
The allegations are from three civil rights lawsuits among 124 that the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) has paid to settle since 2020. The vast majority involved complaints of excessive force inside Alabama’s violent and overcrowded prisons, according to a review of court records and state financial data.
An Alabama Reflector examination found that of 124 lawsuits that ADOC settled in the five-year period between 2020 and 2024, 94 involved complaints of excessive force. Other lawsuits alleged wrongful deaths and accused ADOC staff of failing to protect incarcerated people from violence, including assaults and rapes.
The cost of defending lawsuits against individual officers and larger, class-action cases against the entire department has pushed ADOC’s legal spending over $57 million since 2020. In the last five years, the department has spent over $17 million on the legal defense of accused officers and lawsuit settlements, along with over $39 million litigating a handful of complex cases against ADOC, including a lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice over prison conditions.
Data on civil lawsuits and outcomes against other state prison systems is not readily available, but the sheer volume of excessive force cases ADOC is settling is significant, according to several correctional experts.
“That sounds extreme, in my experience,” said Steve Sinclair, who retired as Washington’s Department of Corrections Secretary in 2021 after a 32-year career in corrections. “It’s pretty routine to have lawsuits for various reasons, and not all of those are legit lawsuits. But certainly not 60 or 80 plus. It’s inconceivable to me.”
The 94 excessive force lawsuits were settled between 2020-2024, but resulted from incidents that occurred in the span between 2014-2022, and cover 15 of ADOC’s 26 institutions, including maximum, medium and minimum-security facilities.
Alleged acts of excessive force resulting in serious injury were documented everywhere from the Loxley community work center, a minimum-security facility housing 360 prisoners who work in the community, to death row at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, depicting an institutional landscape characterized by subterranean brutality.
Forty-five percent of the lawsuits detailed injuries so severe that the victims required hospitalization, ranging from lacerations requiring stitches to broken bones, many requiring surgery. Some complaints allege beatings that resulted in multiple injuries. Medical records submitted in court show one man had both arms broken in an incident involving an officer. Another man said he suffered broken ribs and broken bones in his back from a staff assault. A third was hospitalized with a broken leg and hand. Nineteen complaints described traumatic head and brain injuries. At least seven cases detailed catastrophic traumas that left the victims permanently disabled or disfigured.
The findings are the result of a monthslong investigation that included the examination of accounting data obtained from the Alabama Department of Finance detailing all payments made from the General Liability Trust Fund since 2020, as well as court records connected to the trust fund transactions.










Don't let these people kill me. I'm scared for my life and that they will say I killed myself. 


– Inmate, Donaldson Correctional Facility


The General Liability Trust Fund operates similarly to insurance, with a $1 million cap per incident, to cover both the legal defense of state employees and any potential settlement payment, also known as indemnity, to plaintiffs. State agencies pay an annual premium to participate. The fund is used for individual plaintiff-filed lawsuits that seek damages. Lawsuits filed against entire state agencies, like class-action litigation that seek to change policy, are paid for out of the state’s General Fund.
The increased volume of individual lawsuits filed against employees of ADOC comes as the department is embroiled in several class-action lawsuits against the entire system over prison labor and the lack of mental health treatment, as well as ongoing litigation with the U.S. Department of Justice, which sued the state in December 2020 after concluding that Alabama “failed or refused to correct” unconstitutional prison conditions, including the common use of excessive force.
A staff member from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Alabama’s Northern District said the lawsuit remains ongoing at this time, but would not provide any further details.
ADOC and the Alabama Attorney General’s Office continue to deny that the state’s prison problems amount to systemic constitutional violations, but lawyers for state employees are routinely using public dollars to quietly pay out dozens of lawsuit settlements—the amounts determined in confidential settlement negotiations or mediation, not reported in court filings, and outside stakeholder scrutiny. While settlements are not an admission of liability, these lawsuits were filed over the same conditions that led the DOJ to sue the state: overcrowding, understaffing, inadequate facilities, and “an excessive amount of violence, sexual abuse and prisoner deaths.”
The DOJ began investigating Alabama’s 13 prisons for men in 2016, and in 2019 released the first of two findings letters that detailed why the federal department found reasonable cause that conditions in ADOC violate the Eighth and 14th Amendment rights of prisoners, amounting to cruel and unusual punishment.
“All too often, correctional officers use force in the absence of a physical threat while making no effort to de-escalate tense situations,” the DOJ stated in its findings letter on excessive force. “Such uses of force heighten tensions in already violent and overcrowded prisons. Correctional officers also use force as a form of retribution and for the sole purpose of inflicting pain.”
In response to questions about the surge in excessive force lawsuits and settlements, an ADOC spokesperson pointed to the DOJ.
“Most are piggybacking off the allegations contained in the DOJ findings letters, which ADOC adamantly denies,” wrote ADOC’s spokesperson, Kelly Betts, in an email response.
Betts also wrote that ADOC “does not comment on pending litigation or confidential settlement negotiations and any resulting agreements,” and referred questions about the number of settlements or specific lawsuits to the Alabama Attorney General’s Office, which began handling most of ADOC’s civil litigation in 2023.
The Alabama Attorney General’s Office did not respond to multiple emails and phone messages seeking comment, including a list of submitted questions.
For decades, ADOC had no internal grievance process for people in prison to file complaints over officer abuse or misconduct. Without proper oversight inside the prisons, lawsuits can serve as a backstop for accountability.
Many legal rights and protections for people in prison have been put in place by the courts, and some of those cases started out as complaints from the prisoners themselves. Everything from the right to send and receive mail, to the right to basic medical care are the results of litigation, said one man who has filed lawsuits against ADOC officers in the past and asked to withhold his name out of fear of reprisal.
“There’s really no bottom to how badly a state will treat prisoners without the intervention and oversight of the courts,” he said. “Filing a lawsuit seeking damages is often the only meaningful way to challenge mistreatment in prison.”

‘A culture of impunity’

The 94 excessive force complaints that resulted in settlement payments to victims do not represent the total lawsuits filed against ADOC officers, many of which are dismissed by the courts.
“These are probably the most egregious examples of what is really a culture of impunity and violation of people’s rights,” said David Gespass, an attorney who has represented incarcerated people in excessive force cases against ADOC officers.
The complaints detail incidents occurring in various parts of the prisons — open dormitories and individual cells, but also prison barbershops, chow halls, health care units and bathrooms. Forty-five percent of complainants said officers beat them while they were handcuffed, and 27% alleged the excessive use of chemical spray, two factors cited in the DOJ’s findings.
The state’s highest security and most overcrowded prisons generated the most lawsuits in the time period examined. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer topped the list with 25 excessive force lawsuits ending in settlement, followed by Holman, St. Clair, Limestone and Bibb.
Some of the complaints include shocking and gruesome details.

2018 assault at Ventress. The complaint stated an officer handcuffed the victim behind his back, then struck him from behind, “breaking his jaw in two places, sending a large portion of his jawbone between his teeth and spraying blood all over the wall.” ADOC settled the lawsuit for $90,000, and according to court documents, terminated the officer who assaulted the man.
2019 incident at Limestone. The complaint stated an officer placed the victim in a takedown position, known to cause “excruciating pain” in the shoulders, then another officer kicked his legs, causing him to fall and strike his head on the floor. Officers then sprayed him with mace, kicked and punched him. The man suffered a traumatic brain injury, permanent hearing loss, and numerous contusions, according to the complaint. The plaintiff was released from prison and died of an overdose in 2023, according to court documents. ADOC settled the lawsuit with his mother for $9,000.
2018 assault at Staton. The complaint stated that two officers sprayed the victim with pepper spray, beat him with batons, kicked and stomped him. The man was flown to a hospital in critical condition, where he was diagnosed with bleeding in the brain, multiple fractures to his ribs, face, head, back and damage to his lungs. The man is now in a long-term VA hospital “bedridden, unable to verbally communicate, and minimally conscious.” ADOC settled the lawsuit filed by his family for $55,000.

Five settlements stemmed from a raid at Holman prison in 2016 by ADOC’s “Correctional Emergency Response Team” or CERT. According to the complaints, CERT members charged into the dorm while the men inside were sleeping, shouting and beating men with batons. At least one man was taken to a hospital with serious injuries. The settlements totaled $13,500.
Two years later, another incident involving CERT at Holman led to an excessive force lawsuit filed by a man who uses a wheelchair. The man handwrote in his complaint that one officer slapped him, another hit him in the head with his baton.
“That blow busted my head and caused me to fall out of my wheelchair flat on the floor face down,” he wrote.
“They kicked and stomped on me so viciously until I defecated on myself. I was knocked out unconscious.” His lawsuit ended in a $7,000 settlement.

Prisoners injured during a medical event

At least a half dozen complaints alleged that officers used excessive force on incarcerated men who were in need of mental health or medical attention, including two filed by men who said they were beaten while having a seizure.
One such complaint accused officers at Bibb of beating a man with batons while he was suffering an epileptic seizure in the infirmary, “strapped or handcuffed into a gurney.” When his seizure was over and the beating stopped, officers accused the man of using drugs, which he denied, according to the complaint. They then “chained plaintiff to a wall as he continued to bleed and exhibit clear epileptic symptoms.”
The incarcerated man presented witness statements from other prisoners and prison staff to support his claim, but officers argued their use of force was justified because the plaintiff was violent and unrestrained.
A federal judge denied the officers’ motions to dismiss the case.
“The court finds that a reasonable jury would have difficulty not concluding that prison officers beating a fully restrained, possibly unconscious prisoner who had just suffered an epileptic seizure ‘offends contemporary standards of decency,’” U.S. District Judge Karen Owen Bowdre wrote.
ADOC settled the lawsuit for $30,000.

“Excessive force should always be treated like a big deal,” said former Washington Department of Corrections Secretary Steve Sinclair. “If you tolerate or minimize it, that’s what builds a horrible culture. And you shouldn’t have to wait for a court to tell you.”

Mounting cases, mounting costs

A spike in lawsuits filed against individual officers began in 2020. In the five years before that, ADOC typically filed fewer than 20 claims per year to the General Liability Trust Fund, according to records provided by the Department of Finance. In 2020, the number of claims ticked up to 33, then 58 in 2021. In 2022, facing a surge of lawsuits against officers, ADOC filed 194 liability claims, and then filed 235 in 2023. Complete data for 2024 is not yet available.

That flood of lawsuits caused ADOC’s spending from the general liability trust fund to quadruple. Between 2015 and 2019, ADOC accounted for $2.9 million in legal expenses and settlement payments from the fund. In the following five years between 2020 and 2024, ADOC utilized $17.4 million from the General Liability Trust Fund, more than any other state department.
Legal expenses for the defense of officers named in the lawsuits amounted to double the amount of paid settlements. Between 2020 and 2024, payments to private attorneys who were hired to represent ADOC employees topped $12.9 million in that five year period, while indemnity, or settlement payments to plaintiffs, accounted for just $4.4 million. Plaintiffs alleging excessive force received a total of $1.7 million, with a median settlement of just $8,000.
These figures represent only a fraction of ADOC’s overall legal spending since 2020. Legal payments to outside attorneys and law firms for the department’s defense in class action cases amount to over $39.7 million, paid out of the state’s General Fund budget, according to records available in the Open Alabama checkbook database maintained by the Department of Finance. Combined with transactions from the state’s liability trust fund, ADOC has spent over $57 million on legal services since 2020. By comparison, the Alabama Attorney General Office’s General Fund budget this year is about $13.7 million.
“I think it’s fair to ask, how much is too much?” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a member of the state’s Joint Prison Oversight Committee and a frequent critic of prison conditions and ADOC spending. “It’s hard to imagine that we were intending to create a fund that just allows us to be in a perpetual state of lawsuits forever. When does the state of Alabama start demanding results from these lawsuits?”

How we reported “Blood Money”
When state employees are sued as individuals, Alabama’s General Liability Trust Fund is used to pay for their legal defense and any monetary settlement for the plaintiff. This use of the fund was the subject of our reporting, and records helped us identify 124 lawsuits against Alabama Department of Corrections employees that resulted in settlements between 2020 and 2024.

(Getty Images)Federal spending cuts proposed by President Donald Trump, including $33 billion from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, would be devastating to Nevada, social services providers and local officials warn. 
“Prior to these proposed cuts, our social safety net was not overly strong,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County. Cuts planned by the administration will “reduce it to tatters.”
Trump’s budget requests are shaping legislation in the works by House Republicans that will slash Medicaid and food assistance programs in Trump’s “big beautiful bill” Congress is trying, with some difficulty, to pass. Assuming the bill makes it out of the House, Senate Republicans will attempt to pass it through the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to approve the bill with only a simple majority and circumvent Senate filibuster rules. 
The proposal would reduce HUD’s budget by more than 40% amid a national housing and homeless crisis.
Many social service agencies and nonprofits, including HELP of Southern Nevada, rely on federal funding to supplement their budget and provide needed services. 
HELP, one of the nonprofit organizations Clark County relies on to administer  homeless support programs, receives roughly $10 million of its $30 million budget from HUD, said Fuilala Riley, the CEO of HELP of Southern Nevada.
The nonprofit has been able to use federal dollars to fund permanent supportive housing, which is subsidized for populations with significantly low or no income, such as folks experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, and comes with case management and wrap-around support services.
“This morning, 800 people woke up in a HELP of Southern Nevada program bed,” Riley said in an interview this month. “Half of those individuals are funded by federal funds.”
For every one person that asked for assistance to be connected to a program, “there’s probably 10 other ones that are out in the community,” who need help, she said. 
“The outlook is bleak because before we couldn’t answer all the requests,” Riley said. “Now we are facing a significant possibility that 30% of our funding will go away.”
The list of proposed cuts to HUD funding nationally includes a $532 million decrease in homeless assistance programs and a consolidation of several grants, like those provided by the federal Continuum of Care program that states use to address homelessness.
Clark County received about $21 million in funding from the Continuum of Care program in 2024 while Washoe County is allocated roughly $3.2 million.
Last year Clark County directed funding from the Continuum of Care program to support permanent supportive housing programs, rapid rehousing programs and transitional housing beds provided by the Clark County Social Service Dept. as well as nonprofits, including HELP of Southern Nevada, St. Jude’s Ranch for Children, Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth and Safe Nest. 
Riley said HELP received about $7 million last fiscal year specifically from the Continuum of Care program. “There’s no way I can backstop $7 million in private funding on an ongoing basis” if she were to lose it or have it drastically reduced, she said. 
Peters said in Washoe County the majority of the funding is used by agencies to provide rental assistance and supportive services for people experiencing homelessness. 
The curtailment of vouchers for renters in particular “would have an absolutely devastating impact,” Peters said.
The federal budget proposed by Trump would also reduce the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which provides state and local governments with funding to expand the supply of housing, by $1.2 billion, and cut $196 million from  programs to help housing assistance recipients become more self-sufficient.
Clark County allocated about $9 million in HOME funds it received last year to “support the development or rehab 1,018 affordable housing units across the county.”  
Federal funding directed to nonprofits works in coordination with the resources they provide to create a fragile ecosystem. 
Organizations and providers get allocated federal funding and use it to address specific programs or problems in the community. 
If HELP, for example, doesn’t offer a particular resource or service, it will refer to another nonprofit that does. 
“When you start pulling out the blocks, it’s like playing Jenga,” Peters said. “Eventually it’s going to topple over. That’s a concern for all.”
Trump’s budget request would also slash public housing assistance such as Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8. 
While Washoe County isn’t the only entity that allocates housing vouchers, Peters said starting in 2021 the county received 137 emergency housing vouchers designed specifically to pay rent for people and families at risk or experiencing homelessness.
The program could also be at risk if the proposed cuts go through as currently written. 
“All the people in that program were previously experiencing homelessness,” Peters said. “The vast majority of those folks would return to homelessness if it were not for these voucher resources.”
‘Potential unraveling’ of the social safety net
Federal funding provided in pandemic relief legislation helped governments and nonprofits alike keep people housed, offer food assistance, and keep the safety net from collapsing. Now those funding streams are all but dried up. 
And even that funding could only go so far to stabilize people.
Rents across Nevada, as in much of the country, have skyrocketed and the state has a shortage of affordable and available housing. 
Combine increased rents with other rising costs of living, and “$12 and $14 an hour, that doesn’t cut it,” Riley said.
More than 10,100 people experienced homelessness in Nevada in 2024 – a 17% increase statewide – according to data released by HUD in December.
“If these proposed cuts go through, it’s going to be very difficult to sustain” the work that’s being done to help unhoused people, Peters said. “I think we’re going to see a huge influx in the number of people experiencing homelessness.”  
Close to a third of all state government spending in Nevada is made possible by federal funding.
“It takes all the revenue streams of public and private dollars to meet the needs of our community,” said Sam Rudd, President and CEO of United Way of Southern Nevada.
“It’s a very daunting reality.”
There are a lot of factors that make it “impossible to specifically state” the impact of federal cuts “without knowing what the final decisions are from the state support,” Rudd said in an interview. 
“Many times there are federal cuts that then get stopped or are in legal battles and there is a lot of unknown,” he said. 
While it might be hard to quantify the impact, there is no doubt that everyone in the community will feel the cuts. 
“A lot of people see a headline, read an article and think that doesn’t impact me,” Rudd said. “But it does impact this community and it will begin to create a potential unraveling of issues I don’t know we can quantify.” 
Nonprofits have already had some funding sources paused, including $1.2 million in Emergency Food and Shelter funds, which helps supplement various existing programs, Rudd said.
“That’s going to impact about 125,000 Clark County residents in that specific area,” he said. “They’ve already felt that impact. The funding was supposed to come through April … Not only are they not getting reimbursed for funds spent earlier this year, nonprofits have to put a hold on future expenditures” that would have been paid with that money.
While HELP has yet to suffer funding cuts directly, “we all understand the impact of the trickle effect of all these changes, including potential state challenges, and how the needs of our community are going to increase which will then trickle into other services,” Rudd said. 
The proposed federal cuts come amid projections of a slowing economy that prompted Nevada budget analysts to reduce the state’s revenue outlook over the next two fiscal years by  $191 million. 
Need for eviction assistance ‘is only going to get greater,’ state lawmaker warns

Along with federal funds, municipalities and nonprofits have relied on state funds to provide resources, including rental assistance to prevent evictions. 
State lawmakers allocated $18 million in rental assistance in 2023 to Clark County and Reno to help continue eviction diversion programs set up during the pandemic.
Assembly Bill 475 seeks to appropriate  $25 million in eviction diversion rental assistance funds — $18 million to Clark County and $7 million to Reno. 
It has yet to be voted on but has been declared exempt from legislative deadlines. 
“So many folks in our community have a broken down car or a major medical expense from not being able to make rent and being evicted,” Peters said. “Unfortunately most of those folks we see in our emergency shelter system and we would love to be able to provide more proactive solutions like providing rental assistance to keep people stably housed.”
Even if people don’t feel the impact of reduced state and federal funding that addresses homelessness, Riley said they’ll see it in the form of “an increase in the visibly unhoused.”
A cascade
Federal funding to support housing and homelessness programs works in concert with other types of non-housing related federal resources, Riley said. 
As examples, she pointed to weatherization and energy saving programs, which rely on federal funding, including from the Department of Energy. 
HELP will use those dollars to help extremely low income seniors or households with children to modernize or fix homes to make them more energy efficient. Riley said it is a far less costly practice than moving households to places that are more energy efficient. 
“If they lose their home, (seniors) are not going to be able to afford the market rate,” she said. “Then comes hundreds of households a year that are going to be affected. Weatherization is no longer just an energy conversation, it’s a prevention”
The proposed cuts to Medicaid could also have a sizable impact on people receiving housing and homeless assistance, Peters said. 
“Many of the folks we serve are able to access medical, behavioral health and mental health services through Medicaid coverage,” she said. “If that is reduced, folks can’t obtain that care, which is critical.”
For people receiving housing assistance, help to weatherize homes to be more energy efficient, and food assistance, they could face yet another blow to their fragile support system if they are also kicked off Medicaid, Riley said.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)For decades, our elected leadership at both the legislative and executive levels have neglected to look ahead and find ways to cement a sustainable future for Alaskans.  Instead of working to establish and secure new revenue streams, we married ourselves to oil and mining companies that inexplicably continue to receive massive tax cuts, even as the returns of their industries decline.   Instead of standing on issues like good schools, quality roads, and affordable energy, political debates are instead hogged by questions about how big of a Permanent Fund dividend one can expect.  
In the sphere of Alaska’s public education, this has all culminated in a way that is nothing short of a crisis.  The state has not significantly increased the per-student dollar amount that goes to education since 2012, even though inflation has risen a whopping 40% since then.  Make no mistake, flat funding in an era of 40% inflation is in fact a cut of 40%.  Is it really so surprising that our declining test scores have mirrored that?  
All the while, the state shuffles between excuses, claiming we can’t afford to spend more on education (lack of revenue); blaming so-called “special interest groups” (otherwise known as parents, and the teachers who spend 40 hours a week with your children); and insisting that more charter schools will solve all our problems.  
Charters in Alaska are a wholly unsustainable model that is not expandable in any way, shape or form.  To be clear, instead of addressing the declining enrollment and financial exigency that has led school districts across the state to shutter and consolidate neighborhood schools, the governor is literally proposing we open more schools.  He has advocated making the application process easier and having the state take over the approval process, even though it’s the local school district that would have to foot the bill in their budget.  We can’t even afford to run the schools we have.  We can’t open more.  
What’s more, it is imperative that Alaskans understand that every charter school is subsidized by hundreds and hundreds of hours of volunteer work — unpaid work donated by willing families.  Charter schools in Alaska are public schools of choice, not neighborhood schools, meaning their enrollment is done by lottery.  Families are often required to attend an information night and are asked to sign a document indicating they understand the special commitments associated with attending a charter before they are permitted to even enter the lottery.   Those commitments include student transportation (not a single charter in the state is able to offer busing); supplying food (many charter buildings do not have kitchens and do not operate a food program for breakfast or lunch, and some are able to offer only cold lunch options); and volunteer hour quotas.  Many charters do not have school nurses, PE teachers, libraries or librarians, music teachers, or counselors.  Every family is expected to contribute significant time, labor, and/or money to the school to fill in the gaps.
On no planet is this a sustainable model. This magnitude of commitment is not possible for many, many families.  Advocating for more charters is not a way forward; instead, it is the foremost example of the short-sighted leadership that has led Alaska down this devastating path.  Public education is not supposed to be a caste system.  
The governor is fond of claiming that charters are unilaterally responsible for superior academic performance.  This is a spurious connection.  Certain legislators are fond of impassioned speeches urging Alaska to prioritize charters because their constituents demand it.  That does not legitimize continuing to grow an inequitable system.  
What constituents are really demanding is a better education and better experience for their kids.  Sadly, the last few decades of underfunding have taught us that such an experience may only be attainable through enrollment at a charter school.  Charters are like splinter cells, able to write completely well-intentioned education philosophy into their Magna Carta, allowing them to prioritize small student bodies, low student-to-teacher ratio, alternative learning models that can suit different learners, and immersion into things like place-based learning, the arts, or languages.  Our neighborhood schools don’t get to do that, because they can’t afford it.  That’s not a reason to put more kids into charters.  That’s a reason to demand our government do better.  
You cannot blame parents and families.  The short-sighted solution from the macro perspective is not short at all when you’re on the ground as the parent of school-aged kids: that “short” time is your kid’s whole school career.  As a friend recently observed, you can’t begrudge people for simply utilizing an option that was made available to them at the time.  You can’t blame families for choosing what was best for their kids and sinking their hours into small schools of choice instead of lobbying for state-level structural changes that might take years, and generations of politicians, to come to fruition.  Those improvements might be altogether too late.  
The thing is, it was not the responsibility of families to “zoom out” and understand the complexities at hand in the fight for quality education for all kids — that was on our lawmakers.  In our current landscape, charters are seemingly the only option parents have to make a better educational experience for their kids, so you can’t blame them for saying they want it.  That’s the kind of short-sightedness you’re entitled to when you suddenly realize you don’t want your 5-year-old going into a kindergarten class of 28 kids.  One can, however, blame the state for enabling only that one choice — especially since it’s not actually a choice for so many.  We can demand they do better.
Thank you to Sen. Löki Tobin, Rep. Rebecca Himschoot and the other sitting and past legislators who have been education advocates. Now it’s time for the rest of our elected leaders to pull up their bootstraps, look ahead, and get to the work of restoring public education so that it benefits all of Alaska’s kids — not just the ones fortunate enough to attend charters.

Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska. When he was 14, a teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up and he answered that he wanted to be a lawyer. The teacher chided him, urging him to be realistic. “Why don’t you plan on carpentry?” 
In prison, he became a follower of Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. In his speeches, Malcolm X warned Black Americans against self-loathing: “Who taught you to hate the texture of your hair? Who taught you to hate the color of your skin? Who taught you to hate the shape of your nose and the shape of your lips? Who taught you to hate yourself from the top of your head to the soles of your feet? Who taught you to hate your own kind?” 
Prior to a 1964 pilgrimage to Mecca, he split with Elijah Muhammad. As a result of that trip, Malcolm X began to accept followers of all races. In 1965, he was assassinated. Denzel Washington was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of the civil rights leader in Spike Lee’s 1992 award-winning film.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06124948/Feb21-MalcolmX-featured.webp,,,2025-05-19 09:06:50.535511

Dear incoming student,
Welcome to the University of Alabama! We’re delighted that you’re joining our community of over 40,000 students. We hope your time here will allow you to grow personally and academically.
Moving to a new campus can be stressful. Here are some ways you can make the journey easier.
– Pack light. Take only what you need. Don’t bring groceries or other food; you can pick that up in one of Tuscaloosa’s supermarkets.
– Plan ahead. Talk to your roommates ahead of time to decide who will bring big items to be shared by all, like televisions or criminal attorneys.
– Label boxes. Moving can feel chaotic. Be sure you can track your packages should a law enforcement officer confiscate them.
Here are some items we recommend bringing:

Appropriate clothing – it gets hot here in August!
Academic supplies (pens, notebooks, legal pads, etc.)
Bedding (pillows, sheets, blankets)
Clothing for court (we recommend business attire in neutral tones)
Desk lamp, desk organizer
File cabinet
PACER subscription
Predrafted habeas corpus brief
Towels

One note: hanging items on your walls inappropriately could lead to a damage charge. Please consult the management of your dormitory or apartment building on the best way to display your citizenship or residency papers.
Campus life
Your time at Alabama will lead to friendships that last a lifetime and memories you’ll always cherish. And they’ll be your own, whether it’s cheering for the Crimson Tide at Bryant-Denny Stadium or getting accosted by a man in a balaclava claiming to be a federal official.
UA prides itself on the range of activities it offers students. Get On Board Day showcases all of our wonderful student organizations. Be sure to check it out! We’re working hard to create spaces where students engage in stilted conversations and worry nonstop that one of their colleagues is an informant.
And don’t forget Alabama’s latest, proudest tradition, the PreDawn Knock. Are you one of our 1,200 international students? Maybe you’ll get to frantically call your attorney as Immigration and Customs Enforcement breaks down your door.
(We do not recommend calling administration or general counsel if you find yourself in jail. It is the University of Alabama’s policy to be indifferent to our students’ safety.)
Academics 
With over 200 major or minor subjects to study, you’re certain to find something to match your academic interests. Take special note of our criminology classes. UA offers an unparalleled opportunity to see the nation’s law enforcement seize students on thin pretexts.
For parents
Watching your child leave for college can be an emotional experience. Perhaps you’re worried about how they’ll adjust to a new environment, or if they’ll be shipped without warning to an out-of-state prison. These are normal concerns for any new Alabama student. False imprisonment is one of the many experiences we offer our students.
Questions?
If you have any questions about classes, your dorms or why you’re putting your life in our hands, don’t hesitate to ask. We have staff available 24/7 to give you no comment.
Welcome to Alabama! We’re glad you’re here. And don’t step out of line.

(Photo courtesy Ky Plaskson)Friday was deadline day – the day hundreds of good bills died at the hands of committee chairs in the legislature. Since our legislature only meets every few years and is limited to 120 days to consider 1,174  bills this year  – legislators run up against a deadline. They can’t possibly examine almost 10 bills a day and pretend to make informed decisions. So, they kill bills at extreme expense to Nevadans. In the case of one bike safety bill, killed on Friday, the arbitrary deadline will cost more lives on our roads and discourage cycling for years. 
What is the point of the arbitrary deadline and what are its impacts? Some say it is about efficiency. 
But when we dig down, it’s extremely inefficient and contributes to ill-informed decision-making on the part of legislators, leaving Nevada in the dark ages, unable to make real progress.
Assembly Bill 168 flew through the Assembly nearly unopposed. It allows cyclists to go through stop signs and stop lights if there are no other cars. We call it Stop-As-Yield and you can learn about it and how it’s working in other states in this video. 
The bill had the backing of local transportation officials, federal experts at the Highway Administration, and even the Governor’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Board. Police agencies testified in neutral, not opposed. Why? Forty years of data in other states shows that these same safety measures save lives immediately once enacted. 
The bill would not have even cost taxpayers any money.
But Friday, AB168 hit a roadblock for no reason — or at least no readily identifiable reason — other than Nevada’s arbitrary legislative time limits. Bills had to make it out of the “second house” committee by Friday, or die.
AB168 had sailed through its “first house,” passing on the Assembly floor by vote of 41 to 1.
It died at the hands of one person. The chair of each committee has the power to forward bills to the full Senate and Assembly. But they had to do it by Friday. Democratic Sen. Rochelle Nguyen, chair of the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, was in that hot seat on Friday, facing a deadline with lots of bill sponsors like us struggling to meet with her to try to get past the deadline. But, she said she would not let the bike bill move forward because she has an unspecified “concern.” She has offered no additional explanation despite repeated requests. 
Because of Nevada’s arbitrary 120 day deadline, there is no opportunity to meet with Nguyen or educate her to address her concern, whatever it is. In the 120 day session, her committee had an average of only 2 days to consider each of the 52 bills in front of them. The Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee passed 75% of its bills, half of which they waited until the last week to act on. Ten of their bills weren’t even heard, including one from the Nevada Highway Patrol, S.B. 38, that would have prohibited and penalized road rage in Nevada. That’s something cyclists experience on the road every day and we will now need to continue to endure it because the committee failed to act on that bill which was backed by law enforcement.
These are no-brainer bills but they don’t make it past committee because of these arbitrary deadlines.
Law enforcement and bike advocates will now need to wait another two years before trying again on road rage and our Stop-As-Yield bike bill. We will go through the process all over – volunteering countless hours of time, energy and money with the possibility of unceremoniously being whacked by one committee chair who is running up against an arbitrary deadline and doesn’t have time to thoroughly consider the facts. This is extremely discouraging. 
If good policy that is backed by public safety experts, works in other states, modernizes our roads, saves lives and punishes violent criminals doesn’t make it over the finish line in the Senate Growth and Infrastructure Committee, it makes me wonder what are the common factors that do get a bill over the tight finish line.
For instance, AB 527 barely made it over the finish line at the last minute in the committee. It authorizes cameras to be installed on school buses to catch drivers who blast through school bus stop signs. The video of drivers almost killing children is alarming. That’s not the kind of bill that should have to wait years either, let alone until the last minute to pass because of arbitrary deadlines. Maybe a common factor that contributes to passage of bills is alarming and sensational video that grabs legislator’s attention and is an easy sell. 
Here is another common factor in bills that pass and it points to another serious problem posed by Nevada’s arbitrary deadline. Similar to the bike bill, AB 527 is already working in other states to save lives according to the proponents. Because of their time crunch, Nevada legislators are more likely to just pass things that are already working in other states, but they take a lot longer to do it and ask a lot of questions as if the bill is a novel idea or they ask no questions at all, like they did with the bike bill. Since they spend their time on bills that already work in other states, they are less likely to innovate and come up with laws specific to Nevada.
If they had more time, they would not only pass the laws that are already working to protect residents in other states but they would probably come up with great new and innovative laws for Nevadans. Legislators are sharp, well educated and probably want more time too.
With more time for lawmakers to research, Nevada could make leaps on many levels, not just transportation. But because of the arbitrary deadlines, legislators are killing bills without regard for facts or what their own local experts say. They don’t even have time to explain to their constituents.
Most bill proponents don’t speak out about this, for fear of retribution – that legislators will kill their bills just because they spoke out. It’s time to seriously ask ourselves if arbitrary deadlines are worth the consequences. Now the consequences mean years of more unnecessary deaths on our roads.
I am confident that the Stop-As-Yield bill would have been ultimately signed by the governor. Over the years thousands of good policy bills have likely died this way, never to be visited again.

The fifth-generation logger announced Monday that he will join the Democratic primary, saying in a news release from his campaign that “too many Democrats have lost touch with working people or shown they’re not up to the fight.”
“I know what it’s like to punch a clock, live paycheck to paycheck, be treated like I didn’t matter while some billionaire got rich off my back – and how to turn that feeling of powerlessness into action,” he added. 
Jackson is the fourth Democrat to join the race. He will face Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who announced her bid in late March, as well as Kenneth Pinet and Angus King III, the son of independent senator and former governor Angus King Jr., who announced his run earlier this month. 
The Allagash-native said he is running for governor to help not only working families and seniors, but also to build a Maine where the children raised here can afford to stay. During his time as a legislator, Jackson focused on lowering prescription drug costs, passing universal school meals, as well as securing funding for rural hospitals and veterans’ homes. He termed out last year. 
Jackson is kicking off his campaign with a statewide tour from Kittery to Madawaska. It starts Monday with a rally at the Kittery Town Wharf followed by a tour of Auburn Manufacturing, Inc. and the Lockwood Mill in Waterville.

Ivey on Thursday signed HB 202 a controversial bill sponsored by Rep. Rex Reynolds, R-Huntsville, that provides law enforcement with enhanced immunity protections.
“I was very proud to have two former law enforcement agents sponsoring this important bill in the House and the Senate,” Ivey said in a news release regarding the legislation. “Rep. Rex Reynolds, a former police chief in Huntsville, and Sen. Lance Bell, a former deputy sheriff in St. Clair County, both did an excellent job moving the bill through the legislative process.”
Despite support from Ivey and leadership in the chambers, the bill faced significant opposition from Democrats and civil rights groups, who expressed fears the bill would allow law enforcement to act with impunity. In the final Senate debate over the measure on Wednesday, several Black Democrats discussed encounters with law enforcement, the dangers Black Americans often encounter in them and the warnings they give to their children during those encounters.
“Somebody will look at my baby, and because he’s six-foot, dreads in his hair — they won’t see an honor student,” said Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove. “I can serve here now because my son helps with my father, who is a disabled vet. But there’s somebody that will look at my baby and will decide he is a threat. This bill opens the door for more, not only my baby, but other babies to be at risk in the state of Alabama.”

The bill was amended through the process and only received final approval in the last hour of the 2025 regular session Wednesday evening.
Bills in the package focused on punishment and incarceration, from enhancing Aniah’s Law that creates additional obstacles. Reynolds and other supporters of the immunity bill also argued the measures were needed to improve law enforcement recruitment in the state. Many big city departments, like Birmingham and Montgomery, have reported shortages of staff.
Other bills included in the package enhanced penalties for people charged with crimes that involve firearms, allow agencies to revoke parole and electronically monitor people released from incarceration, as well as make it more difficult to release juveniles after arrest.
Some bills in the package received bipartisan support, including one that criminalized converting semiautomatic pistols into fully automatic weapons.

SB 115: This bill would broaden the existing crime of “impersonating a peace officer” to include individuals who accept employment as a peace officer while knowing they are ineligible to serve or knowing that their Alabama Peace Officers’ Standards and Training Commission certification has been revoked or suspended.


SB 119: This bill would expand the current “certain persons forbidden” law to include individuals with any prior felony conviction unless they have had their gun rights restored by pardon. It expands Aniah’s Law and increases the penalty for shooting into an occupied dwelling, vehicle or other designated space from a Class B felony to a Class A felony. It requires the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to revoke parole, or a court to revoke probation, when a parolee or probationer has been convicted of unlawful firearm possession and revokes probation or parole when the parolee or probationer is found in possession of a firearm by his or her parole or probation officer.


SB 116: This bill would make it a Class C felony for a person to knowingly possess a “Glock Switch”— a part or combination of parts designed to convert a pistol into a fully automatic machine gun.


HB 199: This bill clarifies that the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, or any other state agency, can provide electronic monitoring services to children released by a juvenile court pending disposition of their case, and repeals the 72-hour limitation on confinement of juvenile status offenders who have violated a valid court order.

Democrats fully supported the Glock switch bill, which Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, had brought in prior sessions.
“As we always do, we are going to stand up for what we believe in and work in a bipartisan way, but then, when there are things that we oppose, like the immunity bill, we are going to fight back on those,” Ensler said in an interview on Wednesday.
Ensler opted to view the package as separate bills instead of one large package that was a compendium of several pieces of legislation.
“Look, I would say in general though, between the Glock Switch bill, between those other restrictions on who can access firearms, and then the ankle monitors … there were some good things that came out of it,” he said.
One bill that did not pass was HB 188, sponsored by Rep. Alan Treadaway, R-Morris, to provide scholarships for law enforcement dependents to attend post-secondary education institutions. The legislation won approval from the House in February and got Senate committee approval just over a week later, but did not come to the floor for a vote.
Immunity

HB 202 enhances the standard by which law enforcement may claim immunity from any wrongdoing from actions while performed on duty. Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, D-Greensboro, managed to add reporting requirements to the bill, but the core of the legislation remains largely intact.
Reynolds said in an interview Friday that the legislation “clarifies a 30-year piece of legislation and allows for ‘pause and review’ within 45 days so that a Judge of jurisdiction can review and determine if they in fact have immunity under this law.”
Civil rights groups remain skeptical that the legislation will enhance public safety. Jerome Dees, policy director at the Southern Poverty Law Center likened the legislation to the federal crime legislation that former President Bill Clinton sponsored in the 1990s that was supported by Republicans and eventually passed into law.
“I think after 30 years’ worth of data and multiple Democratic administrations, those policies, those tactics, are not what actually moves the needle on public safety,” Dees said. “What does work are things like the accountability courts, occupational licensure, that crime is often driven by economic opportunity for folks. What I would have liked to have seen from the administration and the Legislature is a greater focus on creating pathways and opportunities for individuals that they may see as at risk.”
A’Niya Robinson, policy director for ACLU of Alabama, said she had questions about creating additional immunity protections for a class of individuals because of their professions.
“There is also a lot of references in the bill to an officer’s ‘discretionary authority,’ and for us, that is very subjective, and of course it varies from officer to officer because part of it is based on their interpretation of the law, which can differ from person to person,” she said.
She added that she was encouraged that the legislation included provisions for reporting, adding that it was an important bill in the package and one that only one that the ACLU of Alabama had been tracking.
“I think part of it is that it touches on so many things that matter to us all, as well as so many topics that have been in the news for the past couple of years,” she said. “There have been a lot of law enforcement-involved shootings in the past couple of years, not just across the country but right here in Alabama. And that hits home for a lot of folks in this state. I think there are a lot of concerns with how law enforcement interacts with Black folks but other communities in this state, for example LGBTQ+ folks, people who have disabilities, and even folks who are in the media.”
During debate over the bill on Wednesday, Democrats in both chambers said they wanted to support police officers who exercise restraint, and said they knew what happened if they did not.
“There’s a reason that we are the ones speaking on this side of the aisle about this bill,” said Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery. “Far too often, we are the victims of it.”

(Photo by FatCamera/Getty stock photo)Maryland is slightly ahead of most states when it comes to supporting maternal mental health, but other states have been gaining ground in the last year while Maryland has been static, according to an analysis that assesses states on a A-F grading scale.
The 2025 Maternal Mental Health State Report Card, released Thursday, gave Maryland a ‘C’ this year, pushing the state just ahead of the national average score of a C-.
But health advocates note that 26 other states boosted their “grades” over last year’s report card, and say Maryland needs to increase mental health screening efforts to help improve its score for next year’s report card.
“Maryland has a lot to be proud of in terms of its grade. It is performing better than most states on maternal mental health policies,” said Caitlin Murphy, one of the researchers who worked on the report. “Maryland is doing better than the national average, which is great … There’s a few key areas where Maryland could continue to improve.”
The Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health released its third annual report Thursday to update grades on states’ accessibility to maternal mental health services.
“The good news is that the U.S. national grade has improved slightly from a D+ to a C- … We’re also seeing 26 state grades improving this year alone, with five state’s earning B’s,” Murphy said. “We know there’s still a lot more work to be done on 19 states that are still earning D or F grades.”
This year, five states received B grades, 27 states received C grades, 17 states received D grades and 2 states received F’s. That’s an improvement from last year, when 24 states received D grades and 5 states receiving failing grades.
“Folks are realizing just how crucial it is to address this. And not only to destigmatize maternal mental health, but really put the policies in place at the state level and the health insurance level to get … all the things we know are needed to support mental health for moms,” Murphy said.
Report: Md. shows ‘incremental’ gains on maternal mental health, but still needs work

“Folks are very aware of postpartum depression, but this also includes postpartum anxiety, OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), psychosis – which is much rarer. But, there is starting to be more understanding around that,” she said.
The report focuses on several areas where states can improve maternal mental health access to services and health care coverage across the states. Some metrics considered include Medicaid coverage, access to maternal mental health providers, and data from insurance coverage and claims for services.
One category assesses whether Medicaid requires screenings and data collection for mental health concerns such as prenatal depression and post-partum depression. Last year’s report card docked Maryland over not requiring data collection on mental health screening – an area that Maryland lost points on again this year.
“States can require their health plans to report on rates of maternal mental health screening,” Murphy said. “Right now, Maryland does not require its health plans, and in particular its Medicaid health plans, to report on rates of maternal mental health screening.”
Dan Martin, senior director of public policy for the Mental Health Association of Maryland, said that the report card shows “that there is room to improve in Maryland,” including in screening for maternal mental health needs.
“Screening and identification for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders really improves the likelihood for recovery of the mother. It supports healthy childhood development,” he said. “It (maternal mental health) can have profound impacts on the health of the mother and her infant and her family.”
That doesn’t mean that those screenings are not happening, Murphy noted, just that the state doesn’t require collection of that data, which can make tracking statewide progress difficult.
“The more health plans that are reporting out the screening rates, the better idea we’re able to have of if it’s actually happening – and that’s one of the biggest gaps right now in terms of data,” she said. “We don’t know yet if maternal mental health disorders are reducing, and part of that is the need for screening to be more universal and for screening to be required, so we can actually track this over time.”

The Maryland Department of Health said in a written statement Thursday that the state is “committed to all women in Maryland achieving and maintaining their highest level of physical, mental, and emotional health and well-being.”
The policy center added new metrics this year that measured whether states invested in group prenatal care for the Medicaid populations. Murphy said such programs help connect pregnant people and new mothers to peers and social supports.
Maryland earned a few extra points for programs such as the Medicaid CenteringPregnancy Program, which brings people with a similar due date together to will learn about what to expect during pregnancy as a community.
But it was not enough to boost the state’s grade to a C+, Murphy said.
She noted that Maryland is ahead of other states when it comes to health care coverage for pregnancy through Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program targeted for lower-income families and other specific populations.
But with members of Congress deliberating significant cuts to Medicaid, Murphy worries that states will backslide on progress made over the last few years.
State officials, advocates fear impact of expected Medicaid cuts in House bill

“Even though states are making this incremental progress on maternal mental health, we also know that right now Congress is putting forward proposed policies to cut Medicaid and Health and Human Services programs,” she said. “If those kinds of cuts go through, we are going to see state scores and the overall national score backslide.”
KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization, reports that in 2023, 41% of births in the United States were financed by Medicaid. In Maryland, about 42% of births were supported by Medicaid coverage that year.
“That statistic is often surprising to folks, but it reflects the fact that this is a really important source of coverage,” Murphy said.
She said that interest in maternal mental health has been increasing over the last few years and hopes that increased awareness of the issue will help deter Congress from cutting supports for maternal mental health services.
“It’s been wonderful that over the past several years, I think people have started to understand the depths of how important maternal mental health is and also how far we have to go,” Murphy said. “This is a real failure of our health care systems to support our moms and families … It’s really a matter of life or death.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2156120290-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)The crisis inside the Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) has generated extensive reporting on escalating prison violence and deaths, the proliferation of contraband drugs, and squalid conditions inside overcrowded and understaffed facilities. These factors led the U.S. Department of Justice to conclude Alabama prison conditions violate prisoners’ Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment, leading to a lawsuit in 2020.
Since then, the state of Alabama has spent over $39 million defending ADOC in a handful of complex lawsuits, including the one filed by the DOJ. But these cases represent only a fraction of litigation involving ADOC.
During the last decade, an increasing number of individual civil rights lawsuits have been filed against correctional officers and prison administrators over wrongful deaths, failure to protect from violence and excessive force. Unlike the DOJ lawsuit or other large class-action lawsuits, individual lawsuits filed by incarcerated people or their families receive little attention or oversight.
These individual lawsuits were the focus of the reporting for this series. We wanted  to figure out just how many lawsuits were being litigated against employees of ADOC every year, and learn more about the nature of the lawsuits, the outcomes, and the cost to taxpayers. Just how much public money was ADOC spending on these lawsuits, not just in settlements to plaintiffs, but paying private lawyers to defend sued officers? And beyond settlement payments, was any systemic change resulting from these lawsuits?
First, we had to recognize an important distinction in how Alabama pays for legal services. When an entire state agency is named in a lawsuit, like in the DOJ’s lawsuit against ADOC, legal services are paid for out of Alabama’s General Fund budget. But when state employees are sued as individuals, the General Liability Trust Fund (GLTF) is used to pay for their legal defense and any monetary settlement for the plaintiff. This use of the GLTF was the subject of our reporting.
We filed an open records request with Alabama’s Department of Finance, asking for a spreadsheet of records connected to all transactions out of the GLTF, as well as total yearly use of the fund by ADOC dating back to 2013. In the spreadsheet, transactions were categorized as either legal expenses or indemnity payments, also known as settlement payments. The transaction records included corresponding case names and numbers, which allowed us to connect each transaction to specific lawsuits. We then located the lawsuits in federal court records, and through reviewing the records, were able to pinpoint lawsuits involving ADOC employees. This is how we identified the 124 lawsuits against ADOC employees that resulted in settlements between 2020-2024.
The 124 lawsuits ending in settlement in this five-year period gave us a fixed group of cases to study, not only to help identify issues and trends in the allegations, but also in the amount of time and money spent on the litigation. Through this project, we aimed to increase transparency and accountability regarding ADOC’s increasing use of public resources and taxpayer dollars. And in an effort to deepen our understanding of the crisis inside Alabama prisons, we also wanted to report on the lawsuits themselves, and the human beings involved, to lessen the abstractions of incarceration and illuminate what would otherwise remain unseen, unheard and unknown.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Barbed-wire-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764

Reservations will begin with Greenbrier and Sandy Point state parks.","Visitors take in Greenbrier State Park in Washington County during an event called ""Es Mi Parque"" in 2019. (Photo Courtesy of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources)At Greenbrier State Park in Western Maryland, the line of cars sometimes started forming as early as midnight, with visitors desperate to secure a coveted spot beside the park’s popular lake after the sun came up.
On the busiest days, the line could stretch a few miles from the park entrance as more and more cars arrived, said Tim Hamilton of the Maryland Park Service. The resulting traffic is just one of the reasons why the park service will begin requiring advance reservations from all Greenbrier visitors on weekends and holidays from Memorial Day to Labor Day, Hamilton said.
The reservation website rolls out Monday, and reservations will be required starting next weekend for the Memorial Day weekend — both at Greenbrier and Sandy Point State Park, which hosts a popular swimming beach on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Anne Arundel County.
Some time later this summer, the reservation requirement will expand to include Point Lookout, Newtowne Neck and North Point State Parks.
Hamilton starts the story in 2019, when there were 14.9 million visitors to Maryland state parks, which “shattered” all previous records. But another storm was coming.
The coronavirus pandemic brought Marylanders outdoors in droves, and park visitorship skyrocketed to 21.5 million: a staggering 45% increase over 2019. That year, 14 of the state’s 75 state parks had to close 292 times during peak season because they had reached full capacity.
A limited staff of park rangers was forced to contend with the crowds and manage traffic, pulling them away from other duties, Hamilton said.
“This is a safety issue,” said Hamilton, the business and marketing manager for the park service. “People get lost in the woods, children go missing by a lake — and every second counts.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The high visitorship wasn’t just a one-year blip. In 2021, the visitorship dipped slightly. But at 20.6 million, it still blew every other year but 2020 out of the water.
“Once we were discovered, we stayed discovered,” Hamilton said.
The idea of a mandatory reservation system isn’t without precedent in Maryland. In 2019, the park service debuted a reservation system for entry to the Falling Branch area of Rocks State Park in Harford County, home to 17-foot high Kilgore Falls, which is Maryland’s second-highest vertical drop waterfall. The falls’ popularity would quickly overwhelm its 28-space parking lot, Hamilton said.
“For a couple weeks, people grumbled,” Hamilton said. “After they got a hang of it, it went swimmingly.”
Park managers got to thinking: Could the reservation system be scaled up?
“We knew we had to do something,” Hamilton said.
Vendor Kaizen Labs developed a website that goes live May 19, where prospective weekend visitors can vie for open slots at Greenbrier and Sandy Point, and pay park entry fees. The first day registration is required is Saturday, May 24.
There’s been at least some grumbling on social media since the park service announced the reservation system earlier this month, Hamilton said.
“They said: ‘Well we already paid for these public lands and now were being told that they’re limited?’” Hamilton said. “What do you do? We don’t want someone waiting there from 3 a.m. on.”
Upon registration, guests will receive a QR code that will be scanned at the park entrance. Park staff will verify the number of people entering the park and assess any additional fees. Visitors without the registration code will be turned away.
Reservations can be made up to seven days in advance, and can be edited or canceled until 8 a.m. the day before the visit.
As of now, there aren’t any plans to expand the reservation system beyond the initial five parks, Hamilton said, even though other parks experience closures during peak season, such as various areas of Patapsco State Park. The focus is on the parks with the most serious visitation woes, he said.
“We want to alleviate problems that we have. We don’t want to create a process where we don’t need to,” Hamilton said.
At both Greenbrier and Sandy Point, signs advertising the reservation requirement went up this week, and park staff members have been handing out flyers to visitors as well. They’re hoping the public information blast, which is also hitting email list subscribers, will ease the transition to reservations.
“For the first few weeks there are going to be some rough edges we have to knock off,” Hamilton said. “But in the end it’s going to be a much better experience for everybody.”
At Greenbrier, the state also just finished a repaving project meant to widen the entry road leading into the park, Hamilton said.
In the end, state officials are hoping the reservation effort eases stress for park staff members, and slows the impact on the state’s delicate natural lands.
“It’s like having a party on your lawn: You love having everyone there — but you’re watching them trample your grass,” Hamilton said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/48230524937_5fb0425b20_o-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-19 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The immigration debate endangers the psychological safety of our kids,Kevin L. Booker Jr. | Opinion Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/the-immigration-debate-endangers-the-psychological-safety-of-our-kids/,"Students in our schools worry about parents being deported because of their immigration status, making it hard for them to learn and thrive.","The other day, I was walking through a school and overheard a student say to a classmate, “Shut up, before I have to call ICE on you.” 
You hear murmurs about what’s going on in schools across our nation. But I heard this negative comment in a school in Connecticut. It shows just how much these types of antics and negative behavior have become the norm in our society under the current administration. These types of comments make people feel unwelcome and unsafe.
Some students in our schools have to worry about their parents or family members being deported because of their immigration status. Even families who have been brought to the United States legally through asylum or refugee resettlement programs live with threats that they do not belong. So, how do we ensure that our students feel safe?  


Psychological safety is the feeling that one is safe to share ideas, take risks, and make mistakes without fear of judgment or negative consequences. This kind of safety is found on Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. The most basic needs we have physiological (which include air, water, food, shelter, sleep, and clothing), but the very next step on the hierarchy is safety (which includes personal security, health, and stability). Psychological safety is a critical need that every human needs to access and engage with the rest of the world.
Students who do not feel psychologically safe cannot effectively engage in learning. They will have difficulty concentrating, poor memory retention, lower academic performance, and increased absenteeism or school avoidance 

Kevin L. Booker, Jr.
The hate speech in our country toward immigration has existed at some level for many years. But with the current administration, people have been given greater permission to freely share their personal opinions, as the person in the highest seat of leadership in this country publicly shares such negative beliefs towards immigrants and refugees.
For many refugees and immigrants who have come to the U.S. legally, this type of talk has sparked fear.  People in their community feel emboldened to shout threats and racist terms at them, tell them to “go back to where they came from,” and express other similar hate-filled sentiments like the threat of ICE action I heard at school.
Recently, President Trump announced that any immigrant can choose to “self-deport,” and the federal government will give them $1,000.  
As a result, individuals who came to the United States legally through the CBP app received a message that it is now time for them to return to their country. The CBP app was a temporarily legal way for people to enter the United States instead of crossing the border illegally, established during President Biden’s administration. 
Additionally, the fear tactics of sending individuals to a Venezuelan prison, talking about wanting to reopen Alcatraz, filling immigrant detention facilities, and highly publicized arrests and deportations of young people have created a very unsafe environment for many of our students and their families.
The fear felt by families in Connecticut has increased since Trump’s first term in office.  Sabrina Tavi, the director of Immigrant Children’s Justice Project, recently shared, “There is significant fear in our communities that’s impacting kids attending school and resulting in families not feeling comfortable sending them to school.” The fearmongering that this administration is conducting is having a significant impact on the young people in our state.
Recently, I had the opportunity to interview two educators in Connecticut who talked about the impact the current social and political environment has on their students and families. 
Wakime Hauser, a middle school special education teacher, says that the media contributes to the fear and false information that others have about immigration. 
Hauser said that in order to feel more equipped to support his students and their families, it is critical that they are provided with accurate and reliable information. He mentioned that it is also essential that people understand the immigration laws and why they were established. He shared that the amount of misinformation in the media – and promoted by the federal administration – greatly impacts everyone’s viewpoint.
One way his school community responded to the political climate was by giving a presentation to the staff about ICE, what it is, and what the Connecticut Law states around immigration. They also outlined what steps would be taken at the school if an ICE agent came to the school.
Dr. Lamirra Hood-Stewart, an educator and former principal, shared that the fear children who are undocumented have is something that no child should have to deal with. She stated that it is critical for schools to create spaces where students feel psychologically safe. Dr. Hood-Stewart described that students are watching the news, they are having conversations with their families about the possibility of deportation, and they are fearful. 
“So, if you don’t feel psychologically safe, how does a teacher say, open up your book to page 5, when in your mind you are worried about all this other stuff?” Dr. Hood-Stewart said.
Dr. Hood-Stewart emphasized how important it is for school communities to support their students. 
“With all of this going on, [families] do not know who to trust…They need that sense of security to know that they are safe,” she said. “The focus should be helping [students] develop into young adults who become contributing members of society.” 
The current political and social climate surrounding immigration has created a profoundly unsettling environment for many students and their families, especially refugees, asylum seekers, or undocumented immigrants. Fear and insecurity are now common realities in many communities, including those right here in Connecticut. This fear directly threatens students’ ability to learn, thrive, and feel like valued members of their school communities. Psychological safety, a basic human need, is essential for academic engagement and personal development. 
It is the responsibility of educators, school leaders, and policymakers to ensure that schools remain safe havens where all students, regardless of immigration status, feel secure, respected, and supported. Let’s continue coming together in our communities and throughout the state to ensure that educators and families have the tools to make their school spaces where every child can flourish.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-19 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about the public benefits charge on your electric bill,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/ct-public-benefits-charge/,"The public benefits charge has drawn the public's ire due to the debate over CT's electric prices, which are among the highest in the nation.","If you’ve taken a detailed look at your Connecticut electric bill over the last year or so, you probably noticed that it’s broken down into four sections: supply, transmission, local delivery and — to the confusion and ire of many — a section labeled “public benefits.” 
While the first three charges represent the cost to purchase and distribute electricity that customers expect out of their utility company, the last charge is less familiar to many even though it has existed in some form for over two decades.
The charge’s existence has become more widely known due to the recent debate about Connecticut’s electric prices, which are some of the highest in the country.
As of the most recent changes to electric rates that took effect May 1, public benefits charges account for roughly 20% of the typical Eversource customer’s bill. For United Illuminating customers, it is just over 18% of the overall bill.
What’s in the charge?
Simply put, the public benefits charge is a collection of state and federally-mandated initiatives that include energy efficiency and electrification programs, assistance for low-income customers and contracts to purchase power from specific sources, such as nuclear power plants. It also includes costs associated with the operations of ISO-New England, the nonprofit charged with overseeing the regional grid.
The price tag for each of those programs are paid by the utilities, who then pass along the costs to their customers through the public benefits charge.


The charts above show the relative costs for all the various components of the public benefits charge in 2024. Current rates are determined both by last year’s costs and estimates for 2025.
The process for determining how much each customer of the state’s two investor-owned utilities must pay for those charges is more complex.
Public benefits charges are assessed a per-kilowatt-hour rate, meaning a customer will end up paying more as they use more electricity.
Each spring, the companies make a filing with the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority showing what their actual costs were to offer previous year’s slate of programs, along with their estimates for what those programs will cost in the upcoming year. The rate, which must be approved by regulators, is calculated using those estimates along with any overcollection or undercollection of costs from the previous year.
“A significant portion of the Public Benefits charge in rates effective May 1st comes from last year’s under-recoveries — which occur when the actual costs the electric companies spent don’t match what they expected so rates are adjusted to fill that gap,” the Office of Consumer Counsel said in a statement this week. “While the companies track costs in detail, they do not measure these gaps on a per program basis. OCC believes it is important for consumers to be able to pin-point what drives both costs and the over or under-recoveries on a per program basis. We are currently advocating at PURA for improvements to both the companies’ accounting methodologies and the [rate adjustment mechanism] process as a whole.”
Last year, the biggest portion of the public benefits charge came from a collection of hardship programs such as Operation Fuel and the low-income discount rate that are intended to help certain customers pay for their utility bills. Another portion of the charge comes from unpaid bills that the utilities have deemed “uncollectable” — and which they are allowed to recoup from the rest of their customers.
Unpaid bills can accumulate during the winter, when Connecticut law prohibits utilities from cutting off heat to low-income customers. State regulators also paused shutoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Together the cost of hardship programs and unpaid bills accounted for nearly a quarter of Eversource’s total public benefits charge and more than 45% of the charge for United Illuminating.
What about Millstone?
Another slice of the public benefits charge that had received heavy scrutiny is the state’s decadelong contract to procure power from the Millstone Nuclear Power Station in Waterford.
Under that deal, the utilities are required to purchase half of Millstone’s output at the set price until 2029. The deal was made after the plant’s owner, Dominion Energy, threatened to shut it down due to competition from cheaper natural gas plants.
When the price of natural gas rises — as it did at the start of Russia’s 2021 invasion of Ukraine — the utilities can sell the power back to the grid at a profit that gets passed along to customers through a credit on the public benefits charge. When gas is cheaper, however, that power is sold at a loss that ends up costing customers more.
Eversource has previously stated that the Millstone contract was responsible for the large majority of a spike in the public benefits charge that hit its customers last summer. Since then, however, more favorable economic conditions have lowered the impact Millstone has on customers’ bills.
Late last month, the PURA approved an adjustment to the public benefits charge and other transmission-related charges that are expected to collectively lower bills by about $13 a month for the average Eversource customer and $3 for the average United Illuminating customer. 
Why were so few people aware of the charge before?
The public benefits charge existed mostly in obscurity — lumped in as part of the larger delivery component of most bills — until 2023, when lawmakers passed legislation requiring utilities breakout the cost of the public benefit charges through a line item on customers’ bills.
As it would happen, the bill redesign took effect just before a spike in the public benefits charge last summer and a subsequent heat wave that sent customers’ bills soaring.
Anger quickly rippled across social media, newspaper editorials and into the halls of the state Capitol, where some politicians seized upon the issue in an election year.
Republicans is the legislature pitched a plan to shift the cost of the public benefits charge onto state coffers, calling it a “hidden tax” on utility customers.
Democrats and Gov. Ned Lamont have for the most part rejected that idea, arguing that the costs of those programs — nearly $1 billion in 2024 — would be difficult to squeeze into the budget without raising taxes or cutting spending on other programs. 
The co-chair of the Energy and Technology Committee, state Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, said this week that he is in the process of drafting legislation that would propose borrowing money to pay off a portion of the public benefits charge like uncollectables and energy efficiency investments, while leaving the rest of the charge in place. A copy of that legislation is not yet available to the public. 
What do the utilities say about the charge?
Because they make minimal profits off programs within the public benefits charge, the stance from utilities has ranged from ambivalence to frustration that customer anger is directed at them, rather than at policymakers who created the programs in the first place. 
“It’s not for us to say if Public Benefits costs should be on a customer’s energy bill,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in a statement. “That’s a public policy decision.”
Ratliff went on to say that the the utility supports Connecticut’s decarbonization efforts — many of which are funded through the public benefits charge — and that other programs “provide critical value” to customers.
“However, we do recognize that having the costs of those state-mandated programs on an energy bill is regressive for lower income customers and removing that charge from electric bills and paying for it through a more progressive system would reduce an average residential customer’s bill by up to $43 per month,” Ratliff said, referring to the amount paid by a standard service customer using 700 kilowatt-hours a month of electricity.
Sarah Wall Fliotsos, a spokeswoman for United Illuminating, sent a similar statement this week pointing out that the public benefits charge stems from programs that were put in place by legislators. 
“We encourage our customers to contact their elected officials with any questions or concerns regarding this portion of their energy charges,” Fliotsos said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/EXPLAINER-PUBLIC-BENEFITS-0509-SR-1-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 08:05:57.033764

Two of the country’s largest collections of Native American human remains are held by museums in Illinois.

To the director of one of the museums, the work to rebury those remains at the behest of a tribal nation or send them to the tribe is an emotional process necessary for correcting historic wrongs – but it also includes a lot of bureaucratic paperwork that can take months to years to process.

And it takes so long for a reason.

The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, or NAGPRA, is a federal law that requires a museum or institution to publish public notices if any human remains or funerary objects it holds belong to a tribal nation.

NAGPRA has existed in a couple of forms since 1990 when Congress first passed it.

By December 2023, the U.S. Department of Interior gave clarification about the now-35-year-old law: Museums and institutions with human remains must reach out to the tribal nations first – not the other way around.

Different groups noted this update to NAGPRA is particularly important – before this, institutions did not have to reach out to tribal nations first, although some institutions were already doing so, like the Illinois State Museum or University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

But even with the change, tribal and museum representatives note the return process is slow.

Raphael Wahwassuck, a council member and citizen of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, Illinois’ only federally recognized tribe, said that when he started as the tribe’s point of contact for NAGPRA, he was initially greeted by stacks of paperwork.

“I had bankers boxes, probably four high, 10 rows deep, of notices that come in,” Wahwassuck said. “Since that time, we've cleaned up our internal processes to where now we're asking for a lot of electronic notices. … I could probably check my phone right now and have maybe 50 (notices), and, it’s just – I don't know that it will ever slow down.”

Two state-run museums and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign are making progress on their repatriation efforts with the help of recent legislation, but a small nonprofit museum near the state's western border has been slower at complying with the repatriation process.

Institutions have until 2029 to publish all of their notices. If they don’t, they can face civil penalties from the U.S. Department of Interior.

A base penalty was established by the DOI for thousands of dollars, which can be increased based on damages tribes suffered or on the historical, commercial, ceremonial, cultural or archaeological value.

Before the most recent NAGPRA revision, the DOI collected about $60,000 in civil penalties between fiscal year 1990 and fiscal year 2024.

Illinois State Museum and Dickson Mounds

The Illinois State Museum and Dickson Mounds Museum are both divisions of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The Illinois State Museum is located in Springfield just beside the state Capitol. Dickson Mounds, a museum built atop burial mounds, is in Lewistown, southwest of Peoria.

[caption id=""attachment_67345"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] The Illinois State Museum is pictured in Springfield, just south of the Illinois State Capitol.

Combined, the two institutions hold the second-largest collection of Native human remains of any institution in the country.

Of the 5,789 remains it holds, about 26% have notices published in the federal register;  last year, over 1,000 notices were published all at once as part of a multi-year effort.

Both locations have been home to controversy over the years, as they had human remains of Native Americans on display for public viewing in decades past, which modern-day American anthropologists would generally consider unethical.

Logan Pappenfort, the director of tribal relations for the Illinois State Museum and formerly the interim director of Dickson Mounds Museum, has been doing NAGPRA work for years.

Before living in Illinois, Pappenfort was the Peoria Tribe of Oklahoma’s director of cultural preservation, where he is also a citizen. The Peoria Tribe has historic ties to central Illinois, having lived for centuries in the current-day Lake Michigan and St. Louis areas.

He said the reasons it takes so long for remains to be returned and reburied are complicated.

Pappenfort said excavation of human remains wasn’t consistently regulated for decades. NAGPRA’s passage created some regulations for excavating on federal land or land near federal tribes, but it was still up to states and even counties to designate guidelines for remains found on private property.

At the Dickson Mounds Museum, a chiropractor named Don Dickson dug up some burial mounds on his property in the 1900s and built a museum on top of it so people could see into the ground below them. The state acquired it in 1945 so it could be turned into a state park.

Native Americans widely protested the museum for decades, as it previously displayed human remains until 1992 when it closed to remove remains from display at the behest of former Gov. Jim Edgar, then it reopened in 1994.

The state hasn’t published notices for about 74% of the remains held by ISM and Dickson Mounds, and Pappenfort acknowledged there’s still work to do.

However, he said it’s unlikely that the state ever reduces the number of remains in its care to zero.

The main reason: The Illinois State Museum serves as a repository for any remains found in other institutions within state borders that can’t be identified.

Wahwassuck said remains can sometimes be found unexpectedly across the state.

“I was just at another institution the other day, and when I first met with them, they assured me that they didn't have anything in their collections,” Wahwassuck said. “Well one of their long tenured employees retired, and as they were cleaning out their workspace, lo and behold, they found a box, and within the box was remains and other items, and so then that caused them to do a complete overview of their entire organization and, sure enough, they found that they had many, many ancestral remains and other items. And it wasn't anything intentional by the organization, per se.”

30 years of relationship building

The state has been trying to make sure that remains can be reburied swiftly to keep up with federal law and be respectful to Native communities. That’s why the General Assembly gave IDNR the power in 2023 to control a private cemetery so reburial could be a valid option.

Now, Pappenfort said most tribes opt to rebury ancestors in IDNR’s private, secretive burial site instead of taking them out of the state and reburying them there, which can be seen as akin to removal all over again.

“In the ‘90s when NAGPRA was new, my tribe, we brought ancestors back to Oklahoma from Illinois because we did not have the confidence at that point that they would not be disturbed again if they were reburied here,” Pappenfort said. “Now, through agreements, legislation, relationships built, there is a confidence that this is where they will be if they are reburied here.

“And so, that's been one of those things that's not been overnight. I mean, this has been a relationship-building exercise 30 years in the making.”

Sen. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, who was trained as an anthropologist, helped pass the bill that would allow Native American remains to be reburied by IDNR.

Walker said reburial was something he found people were open to because it avoided remains “retracing the Trail of Tears” by leaving the state to somewhere else.

“(The bill) allows us to gather those remains and put them back where we got them, to reinter them, to have their own cemetery, to bury them with honor,” Walker said at the time.

Center for American Archeology

The Center for American Archeology in Kampsville, which has the second-largest collection of Native human remains in the state and 13th largest in the country, has not published any public notices to the federal register despite holding almost 2,000 remains.



[caption id=""attachment_67342"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] A sign shows the word “CLOSED” in the front window of the Center for American Archeology.

The museum in Calhoun County on the state’s western border is a nonprofit that receives federal grants, making it subject to NAGPRA. It’s been operating since 1953.

The center’s director said its collection came from excavations since the 1950s.

According to its website, due to multiple floods and the COVID-19 shutdown, the museum closed until a new building could be built. But the rebuilding project has been “put on hold indefinitely” because of a federal freeze on awarded Federal Emergency Management Agency grants.

The director of the center, Jason King, told Capitol News Illinois none of the remains were damaged during the floods because none of them were publicly displayed. He also said he has reached out to 25 tribes since the updates to NAGPRA.



[caption id=""attachment_67341"" align=""alignnone"" width=""1140""] The inside of the Center for American Archeology sits mostly empty aside from a few pieces of furniture and a sign that says “MUSEUM.” The Center is closed while it waits for FEMA grants to be reinstated. (Capitol News Illinois photos by Bridgette Fox)[/caption]



In 2023, before the update to the law, King told  ProPublica, “To date, no tribes have requested repatriation of remains or objects from the CAA.”

ProPublica’s series published in that year identified how “America’s museums fail to return Native American human remains,” identifying how Illinois was one of the worst states for repatriation.

King, who has served as director of the Center since 2017, noted that it doesn’t have the resources of larger institutions.

“The nature of how this operates has changed over time, and my read on the center’s history and what we’re doing now is that we are a different kind of organization than a university or the state system,” King said. “We are making a good faith effort to do the best we can to move this process forward.”

King said the bulk of the remains the center holds are from field excavations from various research programs over the years. Nowadays, the center conducts field research after receiving permits from the state to excavate what were once sites of homes or refuse pits.

Notices are published closer to when remains are ready for repatriation; so while the center has reached out to tribes, it’s unclear whether those conversations will bear fruit until notices have been published in the National Park Services’ NAGPRA database.

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

In central Illinois, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign created a NAGPRA office in 2020 to do the kind of work that was eventually turned into a requirement of the law.

“Since the university created the NAGPRA office and has actually dedicated time and staff and resources, things like that, to NAGPRA, that's part of why we've been able to so greatly increase our activity in the last few years,” said Krystiana Krupa, UIUC senior program officer for NAGPRA.

Since the office’s creation, there’s been a significant spike in notices made by the university with 70% of its 192 total notices being made since 2020.

Krupa said most of the remains that UIUC holds come from the anthropology department going on faculty excavations over the decades.

Of the 760 human remains held by the university, there have been 192 notices sent to tribes. The majority of those notices were sent after the university started its NAGPRA office.

An endless ‘emotional toll’

Another complicating factor is that many remains are considered “culturally unidentifiable.” In the original NAGPRA text, remains could only be repatriated or reburied if they could be definitively linked to a specific tribal nation – without a direct, definitive tie, the culture couldn’t be identified.

For tribal nations, this could be tricky because of how frequently people were forcibly removed from the land; and before European colonialism, land control varied over the course of history.

So, finding out which tribe was somewhere at a certain time could sometimes be complicated, which is why the update to NAGPRA’ definition of “cultural affiliation” can be important.

The U.S. Department of Interior said a tribe’s cultural affiliation to remains could at least be reasonably identified “by the geographical location or acquisition history of the human remains or cultural items.”

With just the preponderance of a cultural connection required, remains that couldn’t definitively be linked to any single tribe are going through the NAGPRA process instead of staying stuck in collections.

Pappenfort said preparing remains for reburial is a delicate – and emotional – process.

“Every day I was doing that work was a toll emotionally for me because I am essentially preparing people I think of as my ancestors for burial. All of us have a handful of times in our life that we experience grief; and in a day, I could experience that same grief a hundred times,” Pappenfort said. “I remember there are a couple days that I even had to step away and collect myself. And so that type of work is hard work, but it's also heart work. And it has to come from somewhere in here.”

House Bill 121 would restrict access to bathrooms based strictly on biological sex. (Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)A district court judge in Missoula extended a pause on state officials from enforcing a new Montana law restricting access to public restrooms, changing rooms and sleeping spaces based on an individual’s sex assigned at birth.
Missoula District Court Judge Shane Vannatta’s 51-page ruling Friday delivered a preliminary injunction blocking House Bill 121 from being enforced. Vannatta last month issued a temporary restraining order on the bill.
“This ruling reaffirms the truth about bathroom bans: they’re motivated by prejudice, and they don’t protect anyone,” said Robin Turner, Montana staff attorney at Legal Voice working with the plaintiffs, said in a statement. “HB 121 undermines Montana’s strong constitutional protections against government overreach and subjects people to unacceptable privacy violations. Transgender people are vulnerable to violence in restrooms, and they deserve protection instead of persecution.”
HB 121, sponsored by Billings Republican Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, applies to all public facilities and those that receive public funding, including correctional centers, juvenile detention facilities, local domestic violence programs, public buildings and public schools. It includes leased public spaces and covers libraries, museums, hospitals, and university buildings, and it requires covered entities to “take reasonable steps” to keep members of the opposite sex out.
In the suit, plaintiffs, including transgender and intersex Montanans, argue HB 121 violates their rights under the state constitution, including “the rights to equal protection, privacy, to pursue life’s basic necessities, and due process.”
Attorneys for the State of Montana argued that the law is intended to provide additional protection and privacy for women and girls in these spaces from biological males.
“Today, we’re maintaining equal opportunity for all Americans, while also protecting women and girls and their right to safe and separate facilities and activities,” Gianforte said in a statement when he signed HB 121 in March. “Because we think it’s pretty simple. A man shouldn’t be in a women’s restroom. Shouldn’t be in a women’s shower room. And shouldn’t be housed in a women’s prison.”
In the court ruling, Vannatta says that the state’s argument that the law is not discriminatory against transgender people — because the definitions of “sex,” “male,” and “female” apply to all Montanans — is “disingenuous.”
The plaintiffs in court documents argued that transgender Montanans have been subjected to repeated unequal treatment by the state, pointing to five separate bills passed by the Montana Legislature over the last three sessions that target transgender individuals.
“Transgender Montanans have been subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal treatment and have been relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command extraordinary protection.”
The court order also says that the state has so far failed to support its arguments that the law helps protect women by not providing evidence of “how female privacy and safety are threatened by trans females.”
“In addition, the State does not provide evidence of how the safety of trans females may be implicated by requiring trans females to use men’s restrooms. The State does not provide evidence of how cis female privacy and safety may be implicated by requiring trans males to use the women’s restrooms,” according to the order.
The state can appeal the decision to the Montana Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the preliminary injunction will remain in place until the court rules on the complaint.
The decision follows another last week by a Missoula County District Court judge that permanently struck down a law from the 2023 Legislature that sought to ban gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Bathroom-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 07:07:15.349066

To support homeless neighbors whose lives are wracked by instability, consistency on our end is key.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sam Bliss: Food Not Cops feeds your neighbors, and makes us all safer.","This commentary is by Sam Bliss. He teaches applied economics at the University of Vermont and has spent the last eight years researching and participating in non-market food practices in northern New England.Anyone who’s hungry is welcome to eat at the free buffet along the low brick wall.Every day for the past five years, a ragtag group of Burlingtonians has shared lunch behind the Marketplace Garage off Cherry Street from 1-2 p.m. Several thousand neighbors have gifted food, cooked meals and washed the dishes.We’re called Food Not Cops — the local chapter of Food Not Bombs, an international movement that shares food in parks and plazas to protest the use of public resources for weapons and war instead of meeting basic human needs like food.Why the wall behind the parking garage? It’s not a comfortable, welcoming environment. When we started, Covid-19 had just broken out. We wanted people to grab food or gear and then leave, rather than gather and breathe on each other. Those were scary times.In the ensuing years, the wall has become a gathering place. We stay because everyone knows to find us there. Sometimes friends disappear for months — maybe they are traveling, working or incarcerated — and then they reappear one day, waiting at the wall with an empty belly or a request for help. To support homeless neighbors whose lives are wracked by instability, consistency on our end is key. The Cherry Street garage is near where many of our unhoused friends hang out downtown. Gathering outdoors, in a place where people can depart in three different directions, helps de-escalate conflicts — and it spares the group from having to play bouncer in any doorway. Nearby dumpsters make it easy to clean up daily.The fact that it’s not a sought-after space has worked in our favor, too: the wall area was unused, so nobody asks us to step aside for more important matters.Until recently, that is. Local business owners, in an open letter about the “crisis” in downtown Burlington, are asking Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak to kick Food Not Cops out of our spot. Several outspoken members of the business community have been blaming our free lunch distribution for alleged safety issues in the garage where Church Street shoppers park.Last September, the City of Burlington started paying $1,500 every week to station a rent-a-sheriff in the garage on weekdays from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., a shift that is centered on our hour-long pop-up buffet. Friends now tell me they avoid Food Not Cops, and the assistance on offer, because of the sheriff’s presence. You wouldn’t want to hang out next to a sheriff, either, if you were homeless.The truth is, Marketplace Garage isn’t a hot spot for crime, despite the city designating it as one. The city government’s open data site shows that since 2020, dozens of Burlington locations have recorded more police incidents than Marketplace Garage, which has seen 126 incidents, with just two of those Priority One, meaning they involved dire threats to physical safety.Compare that with City Hall Park (2,336 incidents; 156 of them Priority 1 or the intersection of Church and Main (1,008 incidents; 57 Priority 1).So, why are local business owners blaming us for their downtown woes?My best guess is that they identify Marketplace Garage as a public safety concern because they don’t want customers to have to interact with any poor people on their walk from their vehicle to the stores they’ll shop at.That’s understandable. Having to witness suffering or deprivation on one’s way to purchase outdoor gear or lunch at Leunig’s can provoke feelings of not just guilt but fear. I suspect my homeless buddies resent me when I begrudgingly buy them one tall can of cheap beer but then I splurge on a spendy four-pack of some imperial porter with an artsy label for myself.If we don’t want to have to look at unhoused people, then our best bet is to house them. Let’s work together on that.

Think about how you treat people when you’re hangry.Second, people are not seagulls; they don’t simply fly away when you don’t offer them food. The letter notes: “Some attendees have repeatedly stolen from businesses or caused harm.” We believe that people deserve to be fed even if they’ve done bad things.Third, Food Not Cops is an alternative to shoplifting for people with unmet needs but no money. We direct resources toward where they are needed, helping broke and homeless folks with camping gear, phone cards, propane and toiletries. Donate to our fund if you can.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)You’ve heard of the U.S. Constitution, right? You can see one of the 1789 originals right there in the National Archives.
At least until the current regime shuts the place down for harboring wokey documents.
You can get yourself a cheap copy of the newest iteration — the one with the freedom of speech part as well as the birthright citizenship, the equal protection under the law, the votes for women, term limits for presidents, and other exciting stuff — small enough to fit in your pocket.
Many of us feel quite attached to the Constitution. Not the current regime, of course, but, you know, actual, normal, sane Americans, at least half the country, maybe even more.
Florida also has a pretty good Constitution. From time to time, citizens have voted to make it even better, trying to improve education, preserve the environment, increase the minimum wage.
The problem is, the governor and the Legislature don’t much like the Florida Constitution. They don’t much like each other, either. And they really don’t like that actual, normal, sane Floridians have been able to amend that Constitution. So now they’ve made it damn near impossible.
A new law demands that petition circulators and petition signers provide all manner of ID, a Florida driver’s license, and last four digits of their Social Security number. Only Florida residents can gather signatures. All signatures have to be turned into the supervisor of elections 10 days after the voter signs or the gatherer will be fined $50 per day per signer.
If voters sign on or before Feb. 1 in an election year, the fine for late turn-ins is $100 a pop, and, if the gatherer “acted willfully” in holding onto voter info and providing late petitions, it’ll cost the gatherer $5,000 a pop.
If you’re not registered as a petition collector and you have in your possession more than 25 signatures in addition to your own petition form or one from a family member, you could be charged with a third-degree felony.
And if Mars aligns with Saturn on a rainy Tuesday in an odd-numbered year, well, you’re going to jail, Buster.
Pregnant pigs
The sponsors of this idiotic bill claim it’s necessary, pointing to a 900-page report alleging all manner of malfeasance in the 2024 campaigns to approve reproductive rights and allow recreational marijuana use.
The report was issued by Ron DeSantis’ own goon squad, the Office of Election Crimes, the same clown car cops who went around arresting people for Voting While Black. This large and extensive investigation netted 18 arrests. Nearly 1 million people, real live Floridians, signed the petition.
In the end, 57.2% voted “yes” on Amendment 4; 42.8%voted “no.” In a normal democracy, we’d call that a win. Of course, Florida is not a normal democracy: maybe not much of a democracy at all.
The Legislature can stick any amendment they favor on the ballot. You, Floridian, have to jump through hoops of fire, spin straw into gold, and answer the Riddle of the Sphinx.
An amendment needs 60% to pass. It used to be a simple majority, but after citizens voted in the notorious pregnant pig amendment, many thought the threshold for enshrining something in the Constitution should be higher and chose to toughen the standard.
You can kind of see why: Outlawing cruelty to our porcine friends was well and good, but did it really belong in the document that lays out the ideals and laws governing the state? I mean, if you want to see an out-of-control constitution, look at Alabama’s: It’s around 370,000 words long and has 900 amendments addressing such issues such as playing dominoes, impersonating a preacher, and driving while blindfolded.
Problem is, if you have a gerrymandered-to-all-hell Legislature, completely unresponsive to the needs of the citizens, amending the Constitution is about the only way to get genuinely important measures passed.
In 2014, 75 percent of Florida voters said “yes” to the Water and Land Conservation Act, which mandated the state use a percentage of real estate taxes to buy and manage properties critical to clean water and wildlife habitat.
But the Legislature and various state agencies chose to ignore what three-quarters of Floridians clearly said they wanted. While the state bought some land with the money, it also paid for office furniture, computers, salaries, even ball caps — none of which do much for the natural environment.
Politicians know better, right?
Thwarting the voters
Same with the class-size amendment, passed in 2002. Voters said K-12 students would learn better if classes weren’t over-stuffed. Then-Gov. Jeb Bush and the Legislature shrugged and refused to enforce the will of the people.
In 2020, voters said how about we gradually increase the minimum wage to a princely 15 bucks an hour by 2026? (FYI: A “living wage” for a single person in Florida is about $23 an hour.)
This year, the Legislature thought maybe we didn’t really mean that and why not let employers pay less than the current minimum of $13 an hour? They called these indentured-servitude jobs “pre-apprenticeships” and “work-based learning opportunities” for young people who don’t happen to belong to the middle-class and might learn valuable skills such as tomato-picking and lawn maintenance.
In a rare moment of sanity during this year’s legislative session, that bill failed. But the governor and Legislature succeeded in casting citizens’ ballot initiatives as ethically and legally dubious.
There was indeed an element of alleged criminality surrounding the abortion and marijuana amendments — on the governor’s part. He weaponized the state against Amendment 4, sending police to petition signers’ homes to question them, posting misinformation on state websites, and threatened broadcasters who ran ads promoting reproductive rights with criminal charges.
Hope Florida, a foundation controlled by Casey DeSantis, used taxpayer money to fight Amendment 3.
Even some Republicans were appalled by this misuse of public funds. Indeed, the only good thing about the new bill is that it bans state officials from using your money to promote or vilify a proposed amendment.
It’s not airtight. But maybe it will slow down Florida’s march toward autocracy.

(Getty Images)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s administration is getting serious about tolling to make up for falling fuel tax revenue and upgrade aging highways — eight years after former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration backed away from the prospect.
The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) “is working closely with the governor’s office, looking at different options: routes, the tolling process, the application, all of it as a whole, to see what makes the most sense (and) where need is greatest,” the agency said.
The governor’s office confirmed its interest.
“No decisions have been made,” Chief of Staff Josh Kelley cautioned.
“But tolling has to be considered to maintain our current and future infrastructure and we are exploring all potential options,” he added.

Strategic changes housed in recently approved legislation could give those efforts a boost.
But the loosened restrictions have sparked opposition from cash-strapped Hoosiers — and those already paying tolls along borders with Illinois and Kentucky.
And it’s not as easy as simply adding tolls to existing interstates.
U.S. law generally bans user fees on federal-aid highways, including those that make up the Interstate Highway System.
There are exceptions, of course.
One program allows tolling on new highways, bridges and tunnels, plus on new lanes, as long as the number of toll-free lanes doesn’t decrease. Reconstructed or replaced bridges and tunnels also qualify.
Another program lets states toll high occupancy vehicle lanes. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) also offers two limited-slot pilot programs.
Familiar terrain
Tolling-curious Indiana has been down this road before.
Fuel taxes produce more than 82% of Indiana’s transportation infrastructure dollars. But Indiana is just 140 miles wide on average, so those who drive through without filling up don’t pay in.
And uptake of fuel-efficient and electric vehicles is expected to cost the state millions, jeopardizing maintenance and expansion plans for vast stretches of crumbling asphalt and concrete.
Lawmakers in 2017 recognized that long-term challenge, advancing legislation that gave Holcomb the power to add tolls. The law also mandated detailed examinations of the concept.
One feasibility study, produced that year for INDOT, estimated that a statewide interstate highway tolling program would have an 85% chance of generating upwards of $39 billion between 2021 and 2050.
It further reported a 50% chance that revenue could exceed $53 billion over that timeframe. The estimates didn’t include the likely significant costs to install and maintain tolling gantries, process payments, provide customer service, enforce collections and more.
Also that year, INDOT produced a strategic plan exploring how it could implement that tolling program.
One of the law’s related requirements — that Holcomb’s INDOT seek federal approval for the tolling initiative — wasn’t fulfilled, the agency confirmed to the Capital Chronicle.

A 10-cent fuel tax hike, accompanied by six years worth of inflation-indexed increases capped to a penny each, did go into effect. In 2023, his last year in office, Holcomb authorized a three-year extension.
It’s just a stop-gap.
“The public has made it very clear nobody wants to pay more for anything right now,” Build Indiana Council Executive Director Brian Gould said. But, he added, “If we continue to look at the model that we operate under right now, we likely would have been talking about a 30-cent gas tax increase this year.”
“So, in order to keep that off the table and keep the plan solvent, you’ve got to look at other funding mechanisms that are out there,” continued Gould, whose industry group seeks sustained funding for Indiana roads and bridges.
That’s why Braun is getting more serious about tolling.
“It’s going to have to be considered because, otherwise, I don’t think we can maintain our main arteries. Asking for the ability to do it doesn’t mean you’re going to do it comprehensively,” he said at a Munster luncheon this month, WTHR reported. “You do it selectively, where the need is the greatest.”
Roadblocks removed
Tucked among House Enrolled Act 1461‘s myriad local funding tweaks are detailed revisions to Indiana tolling laws.
Lawmakers, for example, nullified a ban on new tolls within 75 miles of interstate highways and bridges that already had tolls in 2017. INDOT said the change “provides some more flexibility in terms of locations.”

But Hoosiers already living near tolled facilities object.
Driving the 70-year-old northern Indiana Toll Road‘s 157-mile span costs the typical passenger vehicle more than $15 and can approach $100 for the heaviest-duty, six-axle vehicles. Crossing any of three RiverLink bridges to the south — tolled since 2016 — costs between $2.61 and $15.61 a pop, depending on payment and vehicle type.
The prohibition previously shielded Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser’s Kentucky border community from new additions as far up as Columbus, Indiana.
Now, the Jeffersonville Democrat said, “We could be tolled at mile marker one.” She warned that more tolls in the area would prompt “a lot of noise.”
In some instances, what was stripped out of law is “about as important” as what was added, Gould said.
Careful deletions in House Enrolled Act 1461 also allow the Indiana Finance Authority to take on debt to pay for transportation infrastructure projects, effective July 1.
That is “something that’s not been an option for INDOT for almost two decades,” Gould said. The changes, he added, will let the state leverage its AAA credit rating to finance projects upfront, then use tolling revenue to pay the debt — “easing the burden on Hoosiers.”

“We were almost working in reverse order, because so much of what the state was trying to get to was actually in existing law (as) a prohibition,” he said.
Other tweaks removed requirements that lawmakers specifically authorize certain tolling-related activities.
INDOT said it hadn’t yet narrowed down which exceptions or facilities it was considering.
The agency is “still … casting a wide net, looking at all options, as we move forward,” it said.
Implementing tolling would be a “multi-year process,” per INDOT.
Gould said that in between now and then, “Hoosiers can expect to see major reconstruction of those interstates and expanded capacity. So I think people should likely be pretty pleased with what they see, not happy about paying for it.”

But educators, parents and government officials in this Washington are tracking closely whether President Donald Trump makes good on his threats to cut funding to states that do not prove they have abandoned K-12 diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. 
Fear, anger and defiance have been the response here so far. The fear runs deep. The defiance comes from the top: the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction or OSPI.
Although most of the districts I reached out to for this story weren’t interested in discussing their plans for navigating these issues, education consultant Erin Jones told me that at a recent meeting with King County superintendents, officials were worried.
“They are concerned about budget cuts. But they are most concerned about the uncertainty. That’s the point of this administration: uncertainty. That leaves them in such a bad place,” Jones recalled. “These leaders want to do right by their children and their staff.”
Rising tensions
The U.S. Education Department sent a letter to state education agencies in February, accusing schools of promoting diversity in a way that unfairly harmed white and Asian American students. 
In support of this statement, they cited a 2023 Supreme Court decision that banned using race as an element in college admissions. That case didn’t mention K-12 schools, but that didn’t stop the Trump administration from using it as a reason why Washington and other states shouldn’t be providing extra academic support for students of color.  
In early April, the U.S. Education Department doubled down, with another letter. This one demanded proof that states were following their DEI orders. 
Washington Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal’s response reaffirmed this state’s strong commitment to embracing its diversity and making sure every student gets the help they need. 
“Recognition of our diversity is a cornerstone of public education. It makes us stronger, more civil, and it empowers groups of students who have historically been marginalized or denied equal opportunities,” Reykdal said in a statement. He confirmed that these efforts are paying off in higher graduation and college participation rates for everyone. Plus, Reykdal added, every student benefits from the diversity in our schools.
“Washington will not suppress its core values or cede our right to determine our own education system to the federal government,” he said.  In just a few words, he underscored a key facet of American education: states, not the federal government, take the lead in determining what their children will learn in public schools.
Reykdal’s office continues to draw attention from the Trump administration. 
Later in April, the Department of Education said it would investigate OSPI over “requiring school boards to adopt policies that allow males to participate in female sports and occupy female-only intimate facilities.” This followed the federal agency scrutinizing OSPI over how it handled a years-long controversy surrounding the gender-inclusion policy at the La Center School District in Clark County.
Jones, the education consultant, said she hasn’t met a leader yet who is not committed to continuing diversity, equity and inclusion work. Some are renaming it, opting instead for terms like “community building.” 
Another consequence of Trump era rhetoric and policies that Jones has been hearing about is decreased attendance by Latino students. “No matter what the principal has said that we’re going to protect you from ICE, why should they trust you?” she asked.
“I think we’re afraid for good reason,” Jones added.
Trish Millines Dziko, executive director of the Technology Access Foundation, a Seattle-based nonprofit offering supplemental STEM education in public schools and after-school programs, has also heard that Latino attendance has dropped. And the parents of children who are showing up for school don’t want them participating in field trips.
So far, this is just anecdotal evidence. Detailed attendance data probably won’t be available to the public until next year. Dziko believes the full impact of the Trump administration on education won’t be understood for months or even years.
“There’s a lot of anxiety,” said Dziko, who has overheard immigrant children as well as LGBTQ students and staff talking to each other. “They’re all very close to each other and they worry about each other. …I don’t know if it’s stopping education from happening. But you can hear the conversations between some of the kids.”
After reaching out to about half the districts in the Puget Sound region, plus some in eastern Washington, only one was willing to put someone on the phone to talk to me. Dziko and others I talked to felt this lack of response was born out of fear.
Teachable moment
The state’s largest school district is choosing to carry on and keep working to lift up every child from every background despite threats from the Trump administration. Seattle Public School’s Black education program manager, Anita Koyier-Mwamba, pointed to Head Start office closures and the president’s DEI orders as examples of factors fueling uncertainty.
Still, she believes the difficulties should not stop educators from using this time as a teachable moment.
“It is really important to me that we recognize that history has left us a wonderful catalog of opportunities to explore.”
And then she took a delightful path into American history and the young men like Thomas Jefferson who were so passionate about democracy but didn’t do everything right 250 years ago, although they were trying to solve the problems of their time. 
Why does she want us to think about the 19- and 20-year-olds sitting around debating the birth of a nation? Because it’s a good reminder that young people can think for themselves and should have an opportunity to do so.
“It is unjust not to give our young people the opportunity to … solve the problems of their time,” Koyier-Mwamba said. 
And that comes down to a discussion about justice that must account for the nation’s past. 
This is American history, not diversity indoctrination: The enslavement of people kidnapped and brought here to work the land. The way we have treated the indigenous people before and after the United States became a country. How the Constitution treated enslaved people when the founders couldn’t agree to take a better path. The Civil War and what happened to enslaved people afterward. Fifty years between giving white women and Black women the right to vote.
“Focusing on our shared humanity is an avenue to reconsider how we respond in these times of challenge,” Koyier-Mwamba said. Part of that is choosing to be optimistic, deciding to see the light in the darkness through American heroes like abolitionist Harriet Tubman. 
Similarly, Dziko sees an opportunity to rethink how we do things as a state and a nation. Making sure every student gets the education they need to succeed is not an impossible goal. Dziko believes, and I agree, that state dollars for education could be distributed in a way that focuses more on equity.
“Our kids deserve better,” Dziko said, adding that education reform is directly related to state budget reform because it will take more money to create a more equitable system. 
The 29-year-old Technology Access Foundation does not get federal grants, so Dziko is not concerned about backlash from the federal government.
Where the Trump administration pushes against DEI programs because they say they unfairly advantage Black and Brown people, Dziko and I see racism. “The whole thing has been reduced to, ‘If you are Black, then you did not deserve the position you’re in.’ That’s a very dangerous viewpoint,” she said.
Unfortunately, this viewpoint isn’t new. Dziko is worried about how far back we will go. Before the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education that ruled racial segregation of public schools was unconstitutional?
“I’m always the eternal optimist in my family, but I’m not this time around,” Dziko said.
“We’re going backwards,” she added.
Jones is also feeling pessimistic.
“They want to make America in their image, and their image is white straight men,” said Jones. “They’ve done a really good job of making everything DEI that they just don’t like,” she said. “I’ve really been grieving.”
Like Dziko, while she rejects the Republican vision for education, she is also not satisfied with the status quo. “Republicans say burn it all down, it all sucks. That is not a strategy. The Democrats don’t have a vision,” she said. “Let’s all talk about it. So we have something to activate us. Just saying I don’t want this is not enough. We need people with vision who are imagining a better way forward.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 07:07:15.349066

(Photo by Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)With the conclusion of Indiana’s 2025 legislative session, Hoosiers have reason to be proud  of our state’s leadership on energy policy during this dynamic period of unprecedented  energy demand. The legislature leaned into pragmatic, forward-looking solutions that  balanced reliability, affordability, and innovation — all while reinforcing Indiana’s  commitment to economic growth and building upon current law. 
The nexus of energy and economic development was at the heart of this year’s public policy proposals introduced by Sen. Eric Koch and Rep. Ed Soliday. Whether it  was urging state and federal coordination, supporting emerging technologies like small  modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced transmission technologies, or speeding up  generation build out for large customers, lawmakers and Gov. Mike Braun’s administration  worked with purpose to keep Indiana competitive and demonstrate leadership on key  issues facing our state and nation. 
The adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 3 urges regional transmission organizations  and the federal government to take action on expediting the approval of electric  transmission and generation projects. This resolution recognizes that the ability to quickly develop and build additive energy infrastructure is critical to economic development and  the utilities’ obligation to serve Hoosier customers 24/7/365. 
The bipartisan passage of HEA 1007 addresses economic development, as well, by creating  a 20% tax credit for the manufacturing of SMRs in Indiana. This aligns with the governor’s vision to be a leader in nuclear development and ensures Indiana stays competitive in  attracting a supply chain and developing a workforce needed to meet long-term energy  needs. Additionally, it accelerates regulatory review of generation and infrastructure  projects needed to serve large customers, such as data centers and semiconductor manufacturers. It also includes strong protections for existing and future customers. This is  a win-win as it ensures large customers pay their fair share while making sure the energy industry can meet its obligation to serve at the speed of business.

The General Assembly also focused on reliability of the electric grid and bringing new  generation online. For example, it now requires regulatory review of generation retirements to ensure there is adequate capacity going forward. Another example is SEA  424, which removes initial barriers to the development of SMRs by addressing the upfront costs associated with research and planning. The law allows utilities to charge customers in  real time as costs are incurred, as opposed to all at once after the fact, which saves  customers money. This is similar to how costs are already recovered during the  construction process with ongoing regulatory review. 
The passage of SEA 422 requires the study of advanced transmission technology by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and the consideration of it in planning by electric utilities. This is beneficial for Hoosiers because advanced transmission technologies have the potential to improve efficiency and boost capacity in certain applications thereby saving  customers money.  
Recognizing the importance and benefits of natural gas, policymakers added it to the list of  energy types that qualify as a clean energy resource in SEA 178 for the purpose of energy  incentives. Natural gas has half the emissions as coal and is a cleaner burning fuel with  high efficiency and affordable pricing.  
The General Assembly also took up the topic of siting for energy generation projects  through several hearings in the Senate and House this year. In the end, important steps  were enacted on siting through SEA 425, which codified an energy utility’s ability to site traditional baseload generation on former and existing generation sites over 80 MW or former mining sites without usurping other local, state, and federal permits and laws. This  is very similar to a local ordinance enacted in Spencer County in 2024 related to a current generation facility and the potential for SMR development in the future. Given infrastructure is already located on these generation sites, they are ideal locations for  future investment, which means continued revenue for communities in which they are  located. Lawmakers also capped local moratoriums on projects to one year with the goal of  encouraging communities to set standards going forward while maintaining control over  zoning and other local requirements.  
Energy is the foundation of Indiana’s economic future. It demands recognition of the  unique challenges facing each community and a vision for what we want to become as a  state. As we look ahead, continued engagement between the Braun Administration,  policymakers, utilities, local leaders, and the business community is essential. But with the  momentum built this session, Indiana is well-positioned to lead on energy – just as we’ve  long led on manufacturing, innovation, and economic growth.

The GOP supermajority managed to mend fences and get along most of the year. And even though both the House and Senate left town early last week — an historically rare occurrence that is quickly becoming the norm — they still managed to send 49 bills to the governor’s desk, put two proposed constitutional amendments on the ballot and pass a $53 billion state budget. 
It wasn’t until the final week when the wheels came off, though this time the culprit was squabbles with Democrats. 
Republicans deployed a rarely-used procedural maneuver to cut off debate and pass bills seeking to repeal two voter-approved initiatives protecting abortion rights and increasing access to paid sick leave. The move effectively ended the session two days early and killed a litany of unrelated bills in the process. 
So who were the big winners and losers of the legislative session?

One of his appointments to the State Board of Education got spiked in the Senate, and he pushed his stadium funding plan so late in the session it will now require lawmakers to return to Jefferson City next month in a long-shot bid to pass it and prevent the Royals and Chiefs from moving to Kansas. 
But he got most of the big-ticket items he called for when he laid out his agenda in his first State of the State address in January, highlighted by a capital gains tax cut, state control of St. Louis police and a $50 million private school voucher program.
He also earned rave reviews from state lawmakers, who marveled at a governor actually leaving his office to work personally with the legislature. 
“We made it a priority to walk the halls, not just to meet with lawmakers, but to build relationships, have real discourse and understand what mattered most to the people they represent, because progress starts with relationships and open conversations,” Kehoe told reporters Friday.
The state’s budget may never be as rosy again, with federal funding in limbo and state revenues not keeping up with projections. And with tough fights over stadium funding in the near term and a mid-term election on the horizon, Kehoe’s honeymoon with the legislature could be short lived. 
Whether his first year as governor will be Kehoe’s high-water mark is anybody’s guess. But he undoubtedly just finished one of the best legislative sessions any governor has had in years. 
 Dirk Deaton

The pattern of crafting a state budget has become familiar over the years. 
The House works for months to get its budget plan in place, then the Senate basically rewrites everything before it gets sent to the governor. 
Lather. Rinse. Repeat. 
This year, House Budget Chairman Dirk Deaton certainly had to swallow a lot of spending he didn’t like. But he held firm and won passage of the governor’s $50 million private school voucher program that the Senate wanted to eliminate. 
Then, just hours before the constitutional deadline to finish work on the budget, and after the Senate had already gone home for the week, Deaton orchestrated the surprise death of a $500 million construction spending package — sinking projects for health care, education and law enforcement across the state and creating a bipartisan backlash that helped derail the governor’s stadium funding plan. 
The long-term consequences of Deaton’s move on the House’s relationship with the Senate still aren’t clear. But it solidified his reputation as a budget hawk willing to take extraordinary steps to keep state spending in check. 
 Senate Democrats

 Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck speaks about negotiations on a bill that seeks to establish a constitutional amendment to ban abortion (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The session certainly didn’t end the way Senate Democrats would have liked. 
Efforts to protect two voter-approved initiatives — an abortion rights constitutional amendment and a paid sick leave law — went up in flames when Republicans went nuclear and shut down debate to force repeal bills to a vote. 
The 10 Democrats in the 34-member Senate had already spent months watching a suddenly unified GOP supermajority eliminate taxes on capital gains, take control of the St. Louis police, ease regulations on utilities and implement new hurdles in the initiative petition process. 
Yet despite the inglorious ending and parade of GOP wins, Democrats were successful at ensuring no high-profile bill cleared the Senate this year without at least a few Democratic priorities tacked on. 
The capital gains tax cut also expanded a property tax credit for the elderly and disabled that has been a longstanding Democratic priority. And it included sales tax exemptions for diapers and feminine hygiene products. 
Democrats won additions to the St. Louis police bill banning the shackling of pregnant prisoners, establishing a fund for exonerated prisoners to receive restitution and limiting what jails and prisons can charge inmates for phone calls.
A bill allowing Missouri Farm Bureau to sell health plans also requires all health plans to cover extended supplies of birth control and expands access to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
Next year’s legislative session may not be as fruitful for either party (see below). And it’s doubtful Democrats will look back at 2025 fondly. But the small-ball approach of making bills they hate a little less terrible scored the party some unexpected wins this year. 
 Utility corporations

For the first time in nearly 50 years, Missouri’s major electric utilities will be able to include the cost of new power plants in the rates customers pay for service.
Written specifically to encourage the construction of new natural gas-based generation, the new law could also be used to help finance a new nuclear power station. The law banning rates that include costs for construction work in progress was approved by voters in 1976 in response to the costs of the Callaway Energy Center, a 1,200 megawatt reactor near Fulton.
The utility companies employed “squadrons” of lobbyists to pass the bill, complained state Rep. Don Mayhew, a Republican from Crocker. But they stitched together bipartisan majorities in both the Missouri House and Senate, getting votes from 20 Democrats and 76 Republicans in the lower chamber as it was sent to Kehoe, who signed it.
Just days later, Evergy, a major power supplier in western Missouri, announced plans to construct a natural gas-fired power plant near Maryville.
 LOSERS

 The 2026 legislative session

The final day of the legislative session ended when Republicans deployed the “PQ,” a rule allowing leadership to cut off debate and force a vote over the objections of any senators trying to slow things down. 
The maneuver hasn’t been used by the Senate in five years. Before last week, the Senate had only used it 18 times since 1970. 
Democrats were furious, both because the GOP went nuclear after a session marked by negotiation and compromise and because they did so to roll back laws enacted by the voters just months earlier. 
Knowing Democrats’ response to the PQ would be to spend the final days of session using procedural hijinks of their own to muck up the process, Republicans adjourned for the year.
Senate leaders have historically been hesitant to utilize the PQ because it generates lasting bitterness — and sparks retaliation. And that’s exactly what Democrats promised as they were leaving town last week. 
The bad blood could spill into a special session next month for the governor’s stadium funding plan. But just as likely, it could lead to wall-to-wall gridlock when lawmakers return in January. 
“From this point forward…everything is going to be so hard around here,” said Senate Democratic Leader Doug Beck. “It’s going to be very hard.”
 Direct democracy

 Protestors hold up signs criticizing Missouri lawmakers’ recent votes to overturn ballot measures passed in 2024 during a rally on the Missouri Capitol steps on May 15 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Missouri voters in 2010 overwhelmingly enacted tougher standards on dog breeders in the hopes of eliminating the state’s reputation as the puppy-mill capital of America.
A few months later, lawmakers repealed the law and replaced it with a far less stringent version.
In the years since, the legislature repealed a nonpartisan redistricting plan enacted by initiative petition in 2020; refused to implement voter-approved Medicaid expansion until the state Supreme Court ordered it to in 2021; and this year repealed a paid sick leave law that 58% of voters enacted in November. 
Republicans also put a constitutional amendment banning abortion on the 2026 ballot, months after voters enshrined abortion rights in the Missouri Constitution. 
GOP lawmakers are quick to note that in the same elections that enacted all these policies, voters also put the GOP in control of every statewide office and sent a supermajority of the party to the legislature. 
And they contend voters were duped into supporting the proposals by well-financed campaigns.
“This is one of those things, of the problem with direct democracy,” state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican, said earlier this year. “This is exactly what our founders were expressively against when they formed this nation.”
For Democrats and the activists who backed the initiative petitions, the reality is Republicans aren’t concerned about the will of the people. 
“They disrespect the voters,” Beck said. “They don’t care.”
 Bayer

When Bayer purchased St. Louis-based Monsanto in 2018, it inherited an avalanche of litigation alleging the key ingredient in its Roundup weed killer — glyphosate — causes cancer. 
The German pharmaceutical and biotechnology group has paid about $10 billion to settle Roundup claims, according to the Wall Street Journal, and still faces about 67,000 pending cases. 
Roughly 25,000 of those cases are in Missouri, since Bayer’s U.S. headquarters is in St. Louis. In 2023, a Cole County jury ordered the company to pay $1.56 billion to three plaintiffs, though a judge later reduced that to $622 million. 
The legal and financial peril has inspired the company to push legislation shielding itself from lawsuits alleging Roundup caused cancer. Two states — North Dakota and Georgia — have approved shield legislation. 
But the stakes in Missouri are especially high. 
A group tied to Bayer ran TV and radio ads in Missouri this year presenting glyphosate as a benign, beneficial chemical essential to modern agriculture that is at risk thanks to frivolous lawsuits. 
Legislative leaders, along with the governor, lined up in support of the shield legislation. 
The bill eked out of the House with barely enough votes to pass before running into a buzzsaw of opposition in the Senate. Leading the charge was the Senate Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans lawmakers who in recent years have enjoyed the financial backing of Missouri trial attorneys. 
The four-member Freedom Caucus’s effort to kill the Roundup bill was joined by five other Republican senators after they were targeted with a direct mail campaign claiming resistance to passing the bill was a betrayal of President Donald Trump’s fight against China. 
The rising opposition sealed the bill’s fate, and few expect it to fare any better next year. 
 David Wasinger

 Lt. Gov. David Wasinger watches the Missouri Senate on the first day of the 2025 legislative session (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The first-term GOP lieutenant governor didn’t mince words earlier this month when he decried how the Senate conducted itself while debating the state budget.
It is time for a change, Wasinger declared while presiding over the chamber, and he vowed to take a more active role in proceedings while also working to change the rules of the chamber. 
“Uh… no,” was the response from Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin. 
A lieutenant governor doesn’t have any of that power. Wasinger was out of line giving a speech in the Senate chambers in the first place, O’Laughlin said, because that is “a right reserved for senators.”
Soon after the kerfuffle, Republican state Sen. Jason Bean of Holcomb demanded Senate staff — both partisan and nonpartisan — be directed by leadership not to participate in any efforts by Wasinger to influence the rules or process. 
The next week, with Wasinger presiding, senators began making complicated procedural motions that appeared to befuddle the lieutenant governor. In the confusion, he incorrectly called for a vote on a bill too early, and when he tried to walk everything back left the Senate briefly paralyzed as staff worked to sort things out. 
Wasinger presided for a few more minutes before leaving the dais and sending a letter to Senate leaders informing them he would be absent the rest of the week.

Ballah was one of 41 Conservation Corps members dismissed as a result of budget-cutting, but Christopher Grieco writes that the program is worth saving. (Photo courtesy of Ballah)As the conclusion of my undergraduate education approached, my post-graduate plans grew increasingly unclear. Financial uncertainty and the late realization that I might have chosen the “wrong” major led me to believe that pursuing a master’s degree was no longer a feasible option. The onset of the 2008 recession and tightening job market only heightened my anxiety about the future. However, as the first in my family to graduate from college, I was determined to quickly overcome the first adult-sized hurdle in my path.
During a pre-graduation conversation with my now father-in-law, I expressed doubts and anxiety about my compatibility with – and interest in – the career options available to someone with just a bachelor’s degree in psychology. This conversation provided some of the most honest, timely, and impactful career advice. I was encouraged to focus on my personal interests and passions, while being reminded that my degree was only a foundation — and that a strong résumé and credible professional references were paramount to achieving career success and mobility.
It was during this conversation that I first learned about AmeriCorps. The program presented the opportunity – and breathing room – that I needed: A way to defer student loan payments without accruing interest, earn an education award to support future academic pursuits or pay down existing student loans, and gain valuable on-the-job experience, professional training and certifications, and exposure to career fields aligned with my interests and passions.

With renewed focus, I began reviewing AmeriCorps programs and submitting applications. One program stood out above the rest: the Maryland Conservation Corps (MCC), managed through the Department of Natural Resources’ Maryland Park Service. The program blended my personal interests with foundational job skills I already possessed, while providing extensive training opportunities to help members advance their careers. Immediately, my anxiety began to wane.
Growing up, my family regularly recreated in state parks, hiked sections of the Appalachian Trail, and fostered a deep appreciation for the environment. However, I had never considered a career within this professional umbrella. My two terms as an MCC crew member changed that.
I gained essential job skills — like trail construction and interpretive programming — and honed talents such as carpentry and equipment operation. Just as importantly, I grew in confidence, learned to navigate challenges and began to see my potential more clearly.
The crew members I served have become long-term friends, and the career employees who mentored me became my professional “Mount Rushmore,” demonstrating the importance of intangible qualities such as trust, respect, and accountability. Regular interactions with park visitors further inspired me. I witnessed the joy of inspiring others to care, watched elementary school students and adults introspectively weigh their daily decisions against their environmental impact, and served as an ambassador for Maryland’s diverse natural, cultural, historical and recreational resources.
Since 2011, I have proudly served Maryland citizens as a classified State Park Ranger at several properties, promoting up through the ranks to my current position as a Park Manager. Humbly, I recognize that my career has had highlights – but I would not be where I am without my experience as an MCC crew member. That is a stated fact: without the training, certifications, and on-the-job experience gained during those two years, I would not have built the résumé needed to meet the minimum qualifications for an entry-level ranger position.
Our agency and state are now at a critical juncture due to federal budgetary decisions hampering AmeriCorps’ ability to operate. The human element is incomprehensible. Forty-one resolute, passionate, and hopeful employees were told they could no longer serve as AmeriCorps volunteers, and now their livelihoods and futures are in doubt. Mission-critical agency functions have paused indefinitely. Inspiration, promise, and individual creativity have been stifled. The effective farm team has been put out to pasture, and park professionals across the state are asking: “Why?”
I also wonder: Where would I be now if this had happened to me while I was serving as a crew member? I certainly would not be managing Fair Hill NRMA and Bohemia River State Park or serving as president of the Maryland Rangers Association. That realization saddens me deeply, and it comes with another ponderance: How many future park rangers, educators and positive influencers just had their careers taken from them before they even had a chance to begin?
We need to continue asking “why.” The dedicated members of the MCC deserve it. The classified staff of the Department of Natural Resources deserve it. And every citizen of the State of Maryland deserves it.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_6968-cropped-e1746485657221-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-05-19 07:07:15.349066

The Republican-dominated Missouri Legislature abruptly ended its 2025 session early last week to guarantee passage of two bills to undo what a majority of Missourians had voted for.
Were they working for what was in Missouri’s best interest, or falling in line with the national Republican agenda?
The day before the legislature ended its session Missouri lost a giant, Christopher ‘Kit’ Bond, who as an elected official aways chose what was best for Missouri over being a Republican who blindly pushed a partisan agenda at the exclusion of input from his Democratic colleagues, or the concerns of his constituents.
The legislature’s preoccupation to pass those two bills provides damning evidence of how partisan politics have come to rule the day. Legislators used a procedure to prevent Democrats from raising any objections or providing input and successfully secured their passage.
Also, the majority of Missourians be damned.
One bill puts a new abortion ban amendment before voters in 2026, unless the governor doesn’t decide to do it sooner.
The second takes away paid sick leave from Missouri workers that voters passed overwhelmingly and had just taken effect May 1. Those benefits will now be snatched back from workers on Aug. 28.
Both issues, through the petition initiative process, were decisively decided by voters last November.
A majority of Missourians voted against an abortion ban.
A majority of Missourians voted for paid sick leave.
Pause for a moment and think about what is being pushed about those same two issues on the national level by Republicans, irrespective of what the majority of Americans has indicated they prefer.
When it comes to abortion, the budget bill moving through Congress diverts and defunds agencies like Planned Parenthood, targeting “Big Abortion” as it is being called.
When it comes to paid leave, the United States is one of the few countries in the world that doesn’t have a national paid family leave policy. A bipartisan bill to establish such a policy was recently introduced, which will require state participation. But its fate remains to be seen.
Bills to increase the federal minimum wage have repeatedly failed to be passed by Congress. The current proposed bill is unlikely to pass. Missouri voters have raised the minimum wage three times, including in November to $15 an hour.
What other measures were left on the table that could have benefited many Missourians because of tacit or implicit support of the national Republican agenda?
A major bill, House bill 19 that addressed many needs in communities across Missouri,  expected to be considered was suddenly refused to be presented for a vote in the House.
Needed areas left unfunded included: rural hospitals, community health centers, Boys and Girls clubs, capital improvement projects, higher education, research programs, workforce development, construction of a 200-bed mental hospital and other infrastructure projects.
Meanwhile, billions of dollars remain in a surplus fund.
There was one other area that Missouri Republican lawmakers focused on that aligns, reinforces and support the national Republican agenda.
Tax cuts. Tax breaks.
Republican lawmakers managed to pass their biggest tax-cut priority bill and forwarded it to the governor for signing. The bill allows capital gains exemptions for individuals and corporations.
The bill also provides some limited tax breaks for low income, seniors and the disabled.
Passing a major tax cut is also a high priority for Congress. The current bill contains a permanent tax-cut for the richest 1% as well as targeted breaks for millions of Americans, although they are temporary for some, like the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime pay which will expire in 2028.
While seniors may be eligible for a new deduction, there will be no tax break or tax cut on social security income.
Moving forward, however, the challenge remains: How do we get our elected public officials to rise above entrenched partisan politics and selfish interests and focus instead on those areas that will improve the lives of most Missourians.
Elected officials’ only job is to work for those who elected them.
Republicans at the state and national level seem hell bent on pushing a blindly partisan agenda at the expense of what is best for their state or the country, and the will of the people.

They would do well to reflect on the life of Kit Bond, a stellar public servant and lifelong Republican.
Hopefully, it will be a reminder for some and a lesson for others.
As governor and U.S. senator, Bond was an elected official who worked to address the needs of all Missourians. The issues and legislation he championed were not marred by intractable and extreme partisan politics.
He worked with Republicans and Democrats.
During his long career — in life and the tributes pouring in since his death, from fellow Republicans and Democrats alike — his integrity and commitment to be collaborative to address the challenges that Missouri faced, to arrive at workable solutions, to get the resources needed can be seen in communities across the state.
His impact will be seen and benefit generations of Missourians for years to come.
In this time of hyper partisan politics, and when state needs and interests are co-opted and loss in a national agenda, it would serve current lawmakers well, to look to how Kit Bond functioned.
He epitomized what it means to put the interests of Missouri and Missourians first.
He was committed to get what was needed done.

(Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin’s Republicans urged party members to put aside their differences over the weekend, saying that unity will be necessary if they want to win the 2026 elections for governor, Congress and the state Legislature.
The state party reflected on recent elections as they met in Rothschild, Wisconsin. Many of the state’s top Republicans delivered glowing reviews of Trump’s first few months in office and celebrated Wisconsin’s role in helping reelect him. 
“We are seeing President Trump honor the promises he made,” U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said. “That was made possible because of people like you that delivered the 10 electoral votes to President Trump of Wisconsin.”
Despite Trump carrying the state in November, the state party is reeling from recent losses.
Johnson called the April Wisconsin Supreme Court election “stinging” and a “crushing defeat.” 
Republicans’ preferred candidate Brad Schimel lost his bid for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court  by nearly 10 percentage points, solidifying a liberal majority on the Court at least until 2027. It was the third Supreme Court  election in a row that conservatives lost after  Dan Kelly was defeated by double digits in both 2020 and 2023. The Republican-endorsed candidate for the spring state Superintendent race, Brittany Kinser, also lost in April. Kinser, a school choice advocate, thanked the party for its help at the convention. 
“There’s no way you can sugarcoat that,” Johnson said. 
Johnson said the results were because of “voters who came out to try and save America by electing Donald Trump” but didn’t come out to vote in April to “ensure that [Trump] would have four years where he could implement his agenda without possibly the majority shifting in the House.” He said the party needs to work to get voters out in non-presidential elections. , especially as Trump is in his second term and is barred from running again by the U.S. Constitution.
“As much as many would want Donald Trump to be on the ballot again, he won’t be. He won’t be, and we’re going to figure out how we win, but without Donald Trump on the ballot here in Wisconsin, so that’s just a hard truth,” Johnson said.
Following the April losses, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chair Brian Schimming came under scrutiny by some party members who blamed him for the results. Some at the convention circulated a paper seeking a vote of no confidence in Schimming though the effort never came to fruition. 
Fights within county parties have also broken out since the April elections. Those divisions were on display at the convention as some from a local county party sought to keep Kelly Ruh, the party treasurer and one of the people to serve as a fake elector for Trump in 2020, from being seated as a delegate. Her supporters said it was “absurd” that members of the party would seek to block their own treasurer from voting, while others said she shouldn’t be seated because to do so would subvert the vote taken by the county party. The full convention voted to seat her anyway. 
“There’s always power struggles,” Johnson, who declined to take sides in any fights, said. “But I have to admit in the 15 years since I entered the political process, I’ve never seen as many squabbles.” 
Johnson warned that the party won’t be able to win if Republicans are  “disunified.” 
U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden echoed Johnson’s calls for unity, saying that people didn’t vote because Republicans were fighting. 
“If I hear one more person, say, RINO [an acronym for Republican in Name Only], you’re gonna get the horn,” Van Orden said. “Knock it off. We are Republicans who are Americans who are patriots. We love our country. We love our families. We love our communities.” 
Wisconsin RNC Chairman Terry Dittrich said Republicans need to up their game and don’t have time to waste ahead of 2026. 
“We stop the infighting. We start working together. We welcome the youth in. We pay attention to our goal… to make sure President Trump can finish his job in four years and go on with JD Vance for another four years and another four years and another four years,” Dittrich said. “Let’s all unify.”
State Treasurer John Leiber is leading an effort to examine the recent losses — a job he was assigned by Schimming. At the convention, Leiber cautioned party members against “pointing fingers” at others. 
“That doesn’t help anyone… What I’m focused on is how we can use that experience, learn from it and figure out how to win in 2026,” Leiber said. 
Lieber said his committee is working to gather information and data to understand ways of making progress, and he asked attendees to fill out a handout to provide feedback. He noted that he is up for reelection in 2026. 
“I want to win, so I don’t have any reason to try to smooth things over or sugarcoat. If anything I want to identify what exactly we need to do, what we can do better, how we do it better, and identify the ways that we can all work together to accomplish our goal, which is of course winning,” Leiber said. 
Schimming said that the party has to be honest about the April elections and the frustration about them. But he said Republicans need to focus and move forward to win the next election. 
“Doesn’t mean we agree on everything. Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t change tactics or strategies, but it means we gotta look forward… We’re gonna work together. We’re gonna listen. We’re going to lead. We’re going to lead, and we’re going to do what it takes to win. We won the country last November and saved America. Next year, we can save Wisconsin,” Schimming said. 
2026 gubernatorial, legislative and Supreme Court elections 
The calls for unity come during an off year for Wisconsin elections but also as crucial gubernatorial and state legislative races lie ahead in November 2026. A race for the state Supreme Court will also take place in April with Justice Rebecca Bradley up for reelection,  though that race, which won’t tip the ideological balance of the Court, wasn’t a  prominent focus at the convention. 
Gov. Tony Evers has yet to decide whether he will run for a third term, but Republicans are intent on putting a Republican in office, whether that means ousting Evers or defeating another Democratic candidate. So far, only one Republican, Washington Co. Executive Josh Schoemann, has launched his campaign for the office. 
U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany is also considering a run for governor and spent the majority of his time on stage at the convention taking jabs at Evers.
“The question — as we have this great reset led by President Trump — is will Wisconsin be one of the winners?” Tiffany said. “Will Wisconsin be one of the winners like Texas and South Dakota, Tennessee, Florida? States like that are winning, people are moving to those states, businesses are growing, people want to be there. Are we going to be one of those states or are we going to be like the losers in Illinois and Minnesota?” 
“We all know what the problems are. The question is how are we going to fix it?” Tiffany said. “We can fix it easily by replacing Tony Evers in 2026.”
U.S. Rep. Tony Wied from Wisconsin’s 8th Congressional District said Republicans  need to keep up  their momentum into the next year, and in the race for governor the “fight starts right now” and can’t wait.
“We have a governor who refuses to even say the word mother,” Wied said, referring to Evers’ proposal to update language in state laws related to infertility treatments, “who fights the Trump administration at every single turn, who would rather protect illegal aliens than hard-working Wisconsinites.  
State Rep. Mark Born (R-Spring Green) and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) were also critical of Evers during a panel discussion. Born said he introduced a “ridiculous budget again” that included “reckless spending,” and “massive policy trying to rewrite everything that’s happened in the state in the last more than a decade now.” LeMahieu said that Evers is trying to “turn us into Minnesota, turn us into Illinois — states that have out of control spending.”
“If you could think of a dumb idea for government, the governor probably had it in his budget,” Born said. 
Lawmakers said it would be essential they keep control of the Senate and Assembly to continue to stop Democrats’ agenda.
Running under new legislative maps in 2024, Republican lawmakers lost 14 state legislative seats in the last elections — leaving them with slimmer majorities in the Senate and Assembly. In 2026, Democrats are seeking to flip the Assembly, which currently has a 54-45 Republican majority, and the Senate, which currently has an 18-15 Republican majority. 
“We’re going to be up against it this next year, but we’re out there fighting, knocking on doors. We are the firewall against really horrible liberal policies coming into Wisconsin,” LeMahieu said. 
The Senate will be particularly crucial as it will be the first time the new district lines are in place for the half of the seats up for election. While addressing the convention, former Gov. Tommy Thompson said some have been telling him that they are afraid they will lose the state Senate.
“Don’t even think that way,” Thompson said. “We are winners, not losers. We’re going to campaign. We are going to unite… and we’re going to win.” 
Trump’s agenda 
Republicans were complimentary of Trump’s first few months in office, including his efforts to detain and deport noncitizens, bar transgender people from certain spaces, eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and cut investments in social programs. 
Wied said the border is “more secure than at any other point in history.” 
“Trump is doing what he said he would do. Under President Trump and Republican leadership, illegal immigrants will no longer be given a free pass in this country,” Wied said. “If you break the law, you are going to face consequences.”
“Isn’t it great that border crossings are going down and deportations are going up?” Tiffany asked. “Isn’t it great to live in America like that?
Johnson was not completely on board with everything Trump is doing, expressing concern about the cost of the so-called “big beautiful bill” Trump is working to get through Congress, which using the budget reconciliation process to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase funding for immigration enforcement, expand work requirements for food assistance and cut Medicaid costs by implementing work requirements.
“The big, beautiful bill isn’t what it’s advertised to be,” Johnson said. “We’re not going to be bending the debt curve down. We would be exacerbating the problem by a total of about $4 trillion over the next 10 years.” 
Splitting from Johnson, Van Orden said that Republicans should also be united on Trump’s bill.
“We don’t need grandstanders in the Republican party — stop talking and get it done,” Van Orden said, echoing Trump.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina delivered a keynote address to the convention, praising Trump for his immigration policies and his efforts to stop transgender women from participating on women’s sports teams. Mace is known for seeking to bar transgender people from certain spaces, including bathrooms, locker rooms, and targeting her Democratic transgender colleague in the House of Representatives and other transgender individuals. 
“I like an immigration policy kind of how I like my sweet tea — with a lot of ICE,” Mace said, playing on the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“There has never been a president stronger than Donald Trump. They impeached him. They raided his home. They indicted him. They even shot him, and the man still survived. He stood tall. We prayed for him every single time, because no weapon formed against him shall ever prosper,” Mace said. “Trump is back. He’s securing the border. He’s deporting illegals. He’s protecting women’s sports, and he’s declaring there are only two genders, and DEI under Donald J Trump is DOA.” 
Mace, who noted she’s considering running for governor of South Carolina in the future, took her comments further telling convention goers that the U.S. is in a battle. 
“It’s not necessarily a battle between the parties or left and right or ideology. It is a battle between good and between evil, and we cannot allow this evil to win,” Mace said.

Idaho’s canceled grants were among over $12 billion dollars in federal grants the Trump administration terminated following Trump’s directive. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, terminated the grants to Idaho’s state health department, and other state and local health departments.
An HHS spokesperson said the funds were largely used for COVID-related efforts — including COVID testing, vaccination and global projects. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects to save $11.4 billion, the spokesperson told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” the HHS spokesperson said. “HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun that all the canceled grants “are all pandemic related funding that provided a one-time infusion.”
About $29 million of Idaho’s canceled grants were focused on vaccines for children. Almost $13.3 million of Idaho’s canceled grants were focused on mental health. Another $6.9 million grant was for substance abuse.

Idaho spent about $25.8 million of the canceled grants. The federal government had paid Idaho nearly that same amount through the grants so far, HHS’s data shows. 
HHS terminated Idaho’s grants on March 24, according to HHS’s public list of all canceled grants. 
The grants’ cancellation does not affect ongoing Idaho health programs, McWhorter said. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is “executing its exit strategies to minimize any disruptions for the one-time pandemic grants,” he said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)After a week at the state Capitol to draw attention to their demand for a robust state fund for child care providers, advocates will spend the next couple of weeks back home to amplify their message.
Child care centers will reopen this week after closing their doors for all or part of the past week as providers sought to underscore the urgency of additional support for child care.
Providers will focus on raising more awareness in their local communities, said Corrine Hendrickson, co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), a coalition of providers and parents. Federal pandemic relief money that has bolstered providers since 2021 will run out completely by early July.

This week, WECAN is encouraging providers to do “larger [local] community actions to help inform the community,” Hendrickson told the Wisconsin Examiner. “We’re also going to be calling other child care programs, making sure they even know this funding’s ending.”
WECAN organized the week of action in Madison, calling it “State Without Child Care.”
A small group of providers shut down for the week to dramatize the loss of child care that they contend will be inevitable without strong state support. Others closed for a day or two, and still others opted to stay open while also endorsing the funding demand.
Earlier this month leaders of the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee removed a $480 million child care funding provision from Gov. Tony Evers’ proposed 2025-27 state budget, along with more than 600 other items.
On Friday, Hendrickson and WECAN cofounder Brooke Legler were joined by parents and other providers in front of the Capitol to reiterate their case for restoring the funds.

“My family still currently pays 25% of our monthly income towards child care, and honestly that’s just after-school care and then summer camps,” said Katy Dicks of Sun Prairie, who has a 10-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old son. When the children were younger, child care accounted for a third of the family’s income, she said — while “it has been suggested that 7% of a family’s income is what is affordable.”
Dicks leads the Wisconsin chapter of Mother Forward, a national advocacy group for child care, paid family leave and other policies to support families.
“We need policy that works for all families,” she said. “The quality of care for children approximately 3 months to 5 years should not be based on a child’s parents’ income.”
Also at the Capitol were Rochelle Navin and her husband. They have a 2-year-old daughter, and Navin is expecting twins. Their daughter is usually at Legler’s New Glarus child care center, The Growing Tree, while her parents work, but they juggled home care arrangements to support Legler’s decision to close the center for the week.
Navin told the Wisconsin Examiner it was disruptive to their routine, but the couple understood why Legler took that step.

“There’s two sides of it, right?” Navin said. “You fully understand why it’s gotten to this point, and why the extreme [response] needed to be taken, while at the same time being scared about what the future looks like.”
Evers’ proposal was to extend the Child Care Counts program, originally funded by federal pandemic relief money. The subsidy — originally $20 million a month, then cut back to $10 million a month in mid-2023 — enabled providers to raise wages without having to increase the fees parents pay for care.
A statewide survey conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Institute for Research on Poverty found that 25% of providers said they might close if the revenue isn’t replaced.
Hendrickson said in the coming weeks she and other providers who have been active in campaigning for the support will reach out to operators with messaging guidance for talking to parents as well as to their local lawmakers.
“This week was definitely about coming together as a group in solidarity and really standing up for ourselves and for our children and our families and our communities,” Hendrickson said Friday.
Over the course of the week at the Capitol, “we visited almost every single office, dropped off information, talked to staffers and really helped them see who it is that they’re hurting,” she said.
The providers who engaged in those conversations also aimed to show legislators “that their constituents actually know what they’re talking about — we know what we’re talking about with our businesses, we can speak to it and the reason why we need the funding, and it’s not a handout,” Hendrickson added.
In the Institute for Research on Poverty study, up to 40% of rural providers said they might close if the additional funding stops. That’s  nearly twice the projected closure rate of urban providers.
Brynne Schieffer operates a child care program in the community of Cameron, near Rice Lake in Northwestern Wisconsin.
“I have spent the entirety of my adult life caring for not only my own children, but other people’s children, raising them, raising them to be kind human beings that will hopefully one day go out and be carers themselves,” Schieffer told the group gathered on the Capitol steps Friday.
“The funding runs out in July, and to avoid closure we have to raise our rates between $35 and $50 per child per week. Whose pocketbook can handle that?”
Hendrickson told the Wisconsin Examiner that if rural providers have to raise their rates, they’re more likely to lose families who can’t afford the increase, with no one to replace them. In cities, she said, moderate- and low-income families will be hurt by the loss of child care, but there are likely to be more high-income families able to keep up with rising costs, so fewer providers would have to close.
All but one of the providers who made the trip to Madison last week were from rural communities around the state, Hendrickson said.
“People drove four or five hours to get here,” she said. “It’s because they don’t feel listened to [back in their districts]. And that’s what they said — ‘I’ve had to come all the way down here to get them to listen to me.’”

(Photos provided by the Beech Grove Police Department and Ritchie's legal team)Beech Grove police officer William “Bill” Toney wasn’t supposed to be on the clock that Friday night in September 2000. 
It was a cool, autumn day in the south Indianapolis suburb. At home, Toney had just finished dinner with his wife, Dee Dee, and close friends — a weekly tradition. 
They lingered for a while afterward, watching Jeopardy before Toney headed into work.
Friends said Toney had agreed to a favor — covering the final hour of a fellow officer’s shift so the colleague could leave town early for a family trip. Toney didn’t have to go in, “but he was selfless,” recalled Robert Mercuri, who was a sergeant and supervisor in charge on the night of the killing.
“Bill was the kind of police officer that everyone always describes when they say, ‘This is how we want our police officers to be like,” he said.
As Toney got dressed for duty, Dee Dee helped tuck in his shirt, like she always did. 
“He had to be perfect — he was a neat freak,” said Jeff Horen, Dee Dee’s brother-in-law, and a close friend of Toney’s. “Everything had to be done just right. He put towels down on his floor mats in his car to keep his floor mats perfect. He cared about doing things the right way.”
Just hours before Toney’s 32nd birthday, a call came in about a white Chevy Astro van, stolen from a gas station in Beech Grove.










Sometimes, I wonder if we lose sight of who the real victim in this situation is.


– Beech Grove Deputy Police Chief Robert Mercuri


Around 9:30 p.m. Sept. 29, he joined two fellow officers in the pursuit and chased the van until it crashed in a residential neighborhood at the 700 block of Churchman Avenue
When the van crashed and two suspects fled, Toney pursued one — 20-year-old Benjamin Ritchie — through a dark maze of houses and fences.
Minutes into the chase, Ritchie stopped running, cornered in a backyard on Fletcher Lane. He crouched behind a house and waited for Toney to clear a fence. He fired four times as the officer came into view. 
One bullet missed Toney’s bullet-proof vest by an inch, striking the officer in the lower neck. Toney was able to return fire once but missed Ritchie.
A nearby homeowner who sat alongside the mortally-wounded officer while awaiting help later recalled in court that Toney — who could not speak — twirled his wedding band in his fingers as he took his last breaths.
“I found my friend Bill lying on the ground in that backyard. I attempted CPR. I rode with him in the ambulance … praying the entire time that he would survive,” said Mercuri, who was involved in the initial vehicle pursuit and was among the first to render aid after the shooting. “But my experience told me he was already gone.”
The officer was later pronounced dead at Wishard Memorial Hospital.
“Instead of being able to plan for a birthday celebration for Bill, due to the cowardly acts of a selfish punk, Dee Dee was planning Bill’s funeral,” said Molly Winters, herself a widow of a fallen Muncie police officer and a longtime leader and advocate within Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS), a national nonprofit that supports families and coworkers of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. 
Ritchie, who was on probation for burglary, was arrested in a nearby house several hours later after a search that involved more than 100 officers from multiple agencies. He was charged with murder, car theft and resisting law enforcement, among other charges. On Oct. 15, 2002, he was sentenced to death.
Nearly 25 years after the killing, the state is hours away from carrying out Ritchie’s death sentence. He’s scheduled to be executed by lethal injection just after midnight Tuesday. 
Republican Gov. Mike Braun, following a unanimous recommendation from Indiana’s Parole Board, rejected the inmate’s clemency plea last week.
“If we as a society don’t stand up for those who protect us, then who will stand up and support them?” asked Mercuri. “Sometimes, I wonder if we lose sight of who the real victim in this situation is.”
A ‘model’ officer — and a ‘loving’ dad
Just days before the fatal police chase, Toney sat on the soccer field sidelines outside the St. Francis Hospital campus on the south side of Indianapolis.
On the field was his oldest daughter, Jessica, just four years old.
Horen remembered being with the Toney family that Wednesday evening.
“Jessica was really shy, and Bill was completely freaked out that she wasn’t getting down on that field by herself,” Horen recalled last week during his clemency hearing testimony. 
“He went out and held her hand. She played, she smiled. We talked afterward, and it was like this big sigh of relief,” Horen continued. “I’m not sure whose smile was bigger. Was it Jessica’s, or was it his?”
‘A monster running loose in the countryside.’ Clemency hearings end for Indiana death row inmate

Toney’s family and friends described him as a dedicated officer, widely respected for his calm demeanor, compassion and “commitment to service.” 
He was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and joined the Beech Grove Police Department in 1995 after serving as a Marion County sheriff’s deputy. During his five years with the department, Toney earned a reputation for his professionalism and fairness. 
“He would call dads when the teenage kids were misbehaving … just trying to make life better in his community,” Horen said, before retelling a ride-along with Toney.
“I was riding with him one night. We pulled a guy over who was driving foolishly. He was about a block from his home. We saw him. I got out of the car, and Bill goes out, and he’s like, ‘What are you doing, man?’ And he’s like, ‘I just live right there.’ And he’s pointing at the house,” Horen recalled. “Bill said, ‘Drive your car to that driveway right now. We’re going to come back here repeatedly the rest of the night. If that car has moved, you’re going to jail. But if you stay inside, and go to bed, I’ll catch you a break.'”
“He didn’t want to ruin lives,” Horen continued. “He wanted to protect his community when it helped us. He wanted to help people.”
In emotional testimonies, Toney’s family and friends painted Richie as a remorseless killer who showed “repeated disrespect” during his trial.
Winters recalled that Richie was “rude, belligerent and obnoxious” throughout the trial. She noted that during the victim impact statement by Toney’s widow, Ritchie was so disruptive that the judge threatened to use duct tape to silence him.
Horen highlighted Ritchie’s “trophy tattoo” on his neck — of the number 37, a reference to Toney’s police unit number, with a lightning bolt between the digits — visible on the first day of the trial.

“He turned his head, looked at me, and he wasn’t sorry then, and he’s still not sorry,” said Beth; Toney’s sister, at a May 12 clemency hearing. 
At the 2002 sentencing hearing, while Dee Dee read her victim impact statement, she was repeatedly interrupted by Ritchie, who laughed and later called her a “b**ch” when she said Ritchie was a coward.
Despite Richie’s recent apology before the state’s parole board, “he has never addressed this to anyone in our family,” Toney’s sister said.
“He has never used the words ‘I’m sorry,” she told the clemency panel. “And he has yet to acknowledge that it was more than just ‘a lady’ and two children who have been affected. Families, friends and colleagues are just a few groups that come to mind.”
“Bill is forever gone,” she added. “I ask that my brother be honored as the hero he is, and to carry out the execution sentence to the murderer who has never shown remorse, nor apologized, for the choices he has made.”
Ritchie’s life scarred by ‘trauma,’ abandonment
Court documents, trial records and recent clemency hearing testimony paint a different picture for Ritchie, who in the days before the shooting was living in an Ohio motel and evading charges from an earlier, recent carjacking in Indiana. 
In court testimony, witnesses described Ritchie’s “volatile” behavior in the days and hours before the shooting — he had threatened people with a gun, fired it inside a hotel room, and talked about coming to Indianapolis to fight another man over a personal dispute. 
Ritchie and his group were reportedly drinking and using drugs at that time, too.
Around 7 p.m. on the night of Sept. 29, 2000, Ritchie — along with a man from Ohio, Michael Greer — stole a van from a Speedway gas station in Beech Grove. He armed himself with a stolen 9mm Glock, and according to court testimony, planned to commit an armed robbery. 
Police later found wigs and masks in the wrecked van and in nearby bushes, which authorities said were intended as disguises for the planned robbery.
“That night … was a train that left the station with no brakes, and multiple bad decisions led to losing the life of a man that should be here today,” Ritchie told Indiana’s Parole Board earlier this month. 
He said that on the night of the incident, he was with a group trying to steal rims from car dealers. They took a van and parked it at an apartment complex. When they went back to get the van, a police officer pulled in behind them. 
“Everything sped up then. It was like if you had a fast-forward button on a movie, and you hit the button, everything sped out of control,” Ritchie said.
“I ended up hitting and killing him. That’s something I have to live with every day. I wish I could take that back,” Ritchie continued, crying. “I don’t blame him. He was doing his job. I should have never been in a stolen car. I should never have had a gun. I should have just did the right thing when I got out.”

Ritchie Clemency Public FIlings
 
Ritchie was born into what his clemency attorneys described as “unrelenting trauma.” 
His biological mother, Marion, drank heavily throughout her pregnancy — even more than she did while pregnant with his two older brothers, according to her own sworn testimony.
Her drinking and drug use was corroborated by family members and experts during Ritchie’s sentencing, and again during recent clemency hearings. 
Multiple witnesses, including family and neighbors, recalled seeing Marion visibly intoxicated “every day,” sometimes staggering drunk in public or passed out. One witness told the sentencing jury, “Every day that I would see her, she would be pretty drunk, and I would tell her, ‘stop it.’ It didn’t do any good.”
As a child, Ritchie was frequently unattended. Confined to his crib, he was “left choking on marijuana and cigarette smoke,” his attorneys wrote in recent clemency filings. 
“While Marion ignored Ben’s cries, her friends changed Ben’s diapers, bought him clothes, and fed him,” lawyers continued. “Marion left Ben with anyone who would take him — sometimes leaving an infant Ben on front porches to wait alone for the door to open.” 
Richie was later sent to live with Marion’s sister, Brenda, who lived in “a filthy house with no food.” Brenda’s husband was reportedly physically and verbally abusive towards Ritchie.
Although reluctant, Marion’s sister, Verna, ultimately took Ritchie in shortly before his second birthday, becoming his adoptive mom.
‘I am so sorry’: Clemency hearings begin for Indiana death row inmate Benjamin Ritchie

Verna provided “a much more stable home life,” Ritchie’s lawyers said, but “the damage was already done.” 
“Prenatal exposure to alcohol permanently damaged Ben’s brain, setting him up for a lifetime of brain-based impairments,” the defense team wrote. “Then, the neglect and abuse Ben suffered in his early years further damaged his already constrained ability to regulate emotion.”
Ritchie’s intense anger issues and tantrums began around age three, according to his clemency application. 
“Ben remembers episodes of rage as a child where he destroyed his toys,” his lawyers said. “After each episode when the rage cleared, Ben was left to cry over the broken pieces of things he loved.”
When he started school, Ritchie’s behavior and classwork “were a constant challenge.” Teachers referred him for evaluations every year due to “problematic behaviors.”
At age 10, in the 4th grade, he was admitted to Community Hospital North for a six-week in-patient psychiatric stay. While there, he attempted suicide and told hospital staff he felt like “everyone would be better off if I were dead.” 
Ritchie was diagnosed as “seriously emotionally handicapped,” medical records show. Back at school, he received special education services until he dropped out altogether in 9th grade.
“Given my experiences with Ben as an adolescent, (Toney’s killing) was the exact type of situation where those severe emotional disabilities became fully evident and engaged,” said John Mast, a former special education teacher who worked with Ritchie for more than three years starting in the early 1990s. “He did not have the emotional tools, he did not have the skills, to make a different and acceptable decision.”
By the time he turned 20, before the fatal shooting, Ritchie had been in and out of the juvenile system and had racked up a string of criminal offenses. 
According to court records and his defense team, he struggled with untreated mental illness, impaired judgment and limited impulse control.

Experts testified during his trial and post-conviction hearings that Ritchie’s neurological and psychological impairments made him prone to impulsive, self-destructive decisions — including the one that ended Toney’s life.
Ritchie’s current lawyers point to his recently formalized diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) as shedding critical new light on his behavior — evidence they say was never fully presented to the jury that sentenced him to death. 
While Ritchie’s trial included testimony about his mother’s heavy drinking during pregnancy and his cognitive deficits, the specific FASD diagnosis was not identified until years later by experts using updated clinical standards.
Ritchie’s legal team contends the disorder left him with brain damage that impairs impulse control, judgment, and decision-making — factors they believe should have mitigated his culpability and now warrant a commuted sentence, or at least a new opportunity to present evidence in court.
“FASD is both cause and effect of the crime,” Ritchie’s defense attorney, Steve Schutte, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
He said the case “started and ended at the same spot because of the mistakes made” by Ritchie’s earlier, “ineffective” defense counsel who failed to present Ritchie’s FASD diagnosis at trial or in post-conviction proceedings.
Attempts by the Capital Chronicle to reach Ritchie’s previous lawyers were unsuccessful.
“Nothing presented saying that Ben does have brain damage caused by prenatal exposure to alcohol and other neurotoxins,” Schutte said. “That’s important … we now know that FASD not only helps mitigate the crime, it helps explain the crime.”
Since being sentenced to death in 2002, Ritchie has spent more than two decades on Indiana’s death row. 
Ritchie told the state’s five-member parole board that he “would never hurt anybody again,” and that he’s “never attacked” a correctional officer, “not one time.” He admitted, however, to having past issues with other inmates.

Prison records show at least 43 disciplinary conduct reports, including threats against staff, assaults on inmates, and possession of a six-inch shank. In one incident, he told a guard he hoped his next victim would be a Black female officer. In another, he was caught coughing on staff after testing positive for COVID-19. And last December, prison officials say Ritchie asked a correctional officer to procure methamphetamine for him.
His attorneys, however, cited numerous positive interactions in prison — like mentoring other inmates and writing poetry — as signs of his reform. During incarceration, he’s learned to cut hair and give others tattoos. Ritchie said he uses those skills as opportunities to talk to younger inmates.
Through a prison program allowing inmates to adopt animals, Ritchie additionally found companionship in a shelter cat named Cletus.
“Ben loves animals. He’s enamored with their cuteness, their ingenuity, and their unique personalities. His cell is covered in wall hangings depicting horses, buffalo, and wolves — animals he likely encountered in his beloved Western novels,” his lawyers said. “Through his relationship with Cletus, Ben was finally able to experience the unconditional love absent from his tumultuous childhood.”
Ritchie said he “didn’t take credit” for his actions for years and “was in a dark hole.” But since receiving mental health counseling in prison, he’s learned “coping mechanisms” and “gotten control” of himself.
“I’m just not that kid I was 25 years ago. That kid was lost. He needed guidance, and I have guidance now,” Ritchie added.
“What I did was horrible. But it’s a blessing, because William Toney’s life could best be served by me helping other guys,” he reiterated. “I’m never going to go home. I’m OK with that. But if I’m in here, I’m trying to help guys not reoffend, not come back to this system.”
Closure for some, an injustice to others
Toney’s family and friends who have spoken publicly said Ritchie’s execution is the final, necessary step in a years long journey for closure.
“It’s time. We’re all tired,” said Dee Dee, Toney’s widow. “It is time for this chapter of my story, our story, to be closed. It’s time for us to remember Bill, to remember Bill’s life, and not his death.”
Joel Hand, a former prosecutor on Ritchie’s case, told the Capital Chronicle that he remains “firmly” supportive of Ritchie’s death sentence.
“Indiana has the death penalty for a reason, and murder of a law enforcement officer in the line of duty is clearly one of the qualifiers for capital punishment,” Hand said in a recent interview. He added that “there is absolutely nothing about this case that would have indicated in any way, shape, or form, that the death penalty was not appropriate for Benjamin Ritchie.”
Hand noted that during trial proceedings, Ritchie showed “no remorse,” was disrespectful to his own counsel, and “was very spiteful and hateful” toward Toney’s widow.
Among the other Indiana officials who have urged that state to move forward with the scheduled execution, Delaware County Prosecutor Eric Hoffman said in a recent letter that “there are absolutely no injustices to correct in Ritchie’s convictions and sentence.”
Hoffman was not involved in prosecuting the case but said he felt compelled to speak out. 
“Perhaps the only injustice is that it has taken this long to carry out the lawfully imposed sentence of death,” he wrote. “Quite the contrary. Perhaps the only injustice is that it has taken this long to carry out the lawfully imposed sentence of death.”
He emphasized the gravity of Ritchie’s actions and framed the crime as an attack not just on one officer, but on the rule of law itself. 
Hoffman described law enforcement as “peace keepers, the shield for the innocent and vulnerable, the guardians standing between us and violence and lawlessness.”

Ritchie letter
 
“They form the thin blue line that stands between criminals and their would-be victims,” he continued. “It is the police who stand on that line between law, order, and safety and that of chaos, anarchy, and violence.”
Police officers, he added, “have the absolute right to go home to their family at the end of their shift.” 
“Benjamin Ritchie infringed on Officer Toney’s rights in the most egregious way,” Hoffman wrote. “Ritchie seeks mercy. However, mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent.” 
But opponents of the death penalty argue that Ritchie’s execution would not reflect justice.
Anti-death penalty advocates note that Ritchie’s “widely publicized mental disabilities … have never been fully considered in court,” raising concerns about “disparities in the use of the death penalty.”
Leadership at Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, further emphasized that since Ritchie was convicted in 2002, 29 additional Indiana law enforcement officers have been killed in the line of duty, “yet not one of those cases has resulted in a death sentence.”
“Benjamin Ritchie can be held accountable and severely punished without executing him,” said Abraham Bonowitz, the groups’ executive director. “Governor Braun has until Monday night at midnight to change his mind. We urge him to please show mercy by commuting Ben Ritchie’s death sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.”
Statistics cited by Death Penalty Action further show that law enforcement officers are more likely to be killed in the line of duty in states that have the death penalty than in states that do not have it, “and even more so in states that actually carry out executions.”

Ritchie’s attorneys wanted to explore his FASD diagnosis before the Indiana Supreme Court, but the justices denied requests for a new hearing. The inmate’s lawyers are now seeking a last-minute execution pause from the U.S. Supreme Court. As of Monday morning, a decision had not been issued.
A separate lawsuit filed by Ritchie’s lawyers last week sought to allow clergy to be present at the Tuesday execution. Court records indicate the case was resolved as of Friday, though the terms remain unclear. After suing the state, Joseph Corcoran was allowed to have a pastor in the execution chamber.
It’s also still unclear whether any media representatives will be invited to witness Ritchie’s execution.
A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the Capital Chronicle and four other news outlets to pause a state law and Department of Correction (DOC) policy barring independent media witnesses.
News reporters are granted access to a designated area outside of the Indiana State Prison but are not permitted to directly witness the state’s actions — unless invited by the condemned to fill one of the five spots.
The Capital Chronicle and other news outlets have requested spots on Ritchie’s witness list but have so far been denied.
“We have to make sure that with execution, which you can’t take back, everything is done correctly. In this case, you can’t say that Ben’s had fair process,” said Mark Koselke, an attorney on Ritchie’s defense team. “His most important goal right now is to help as much as possible … to help better the prison system, and help people that are going to get out someday — and to do good on behalf of Toney’s name for what happened, as much as he can, with what’s given left in his life.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Some are questioning the wisdom of Oklahoma Republicans’ plans to cut taxes amid the ongoing push for budgetary reform in the nation’s Capitol that aims to shift the cost for some high-dollar federal programs onto states.
Some critics of the plan to cut Oklahoma’s income tax 0.25% said the state will likely need the revenue the existing tax generates if congressional Republicans move forward with plans to require states to bear some costs of programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as SNAP or food stamps. Experts also point to broader economic concerns that the Trump administration’s tariffs could increase the costs for goods and reduce consumer spending, resulting in less sales tax revenue.
But a top legislative Republican said he is not concerned about the budgetary uncertainty playing out in D.C. 
Republicans said that now is the right time to cut the state’s top income tax rate from 4.75% to 4.5%, which will allow Oklahomans to keep more of their money. They said will grow spending and increase Oklahoma’s competitiveness in luring new residents to the state.
Gov. Kevin Stitt said the state’s income tax used to be 7% and has been gradually reduced.
“And every time we’ve seen that, the economy continues to expand,” Stitt said. “We’ve seen revenue continue to grow.”
A family of four with an income of $50,000 would save about $137 a year, according to Senate staff.
The Oklahoma Policy Institute, a Tulsa-based think tank, said a 0.25% cut will cost state coffers about $338 million annually.
Lawmakers are also discussing reducing the number of income tax brackets to three from six. The organization estimates that it will cost an additional $87 million a year.
“It is not wise at all,” said Aanahita Ervin, the organization’s fiscal policy analyst, of making tax cuts this year. “The (federal) costs are going to impact every state.”
Oklahoma Democratic lawmakers are also sounding the alarm, though being in the minority they can do little on their own to stop a tax cut.
Under the most current plan, congressional Republicans are hoping to reduce Medicaid spending by about $625 billion, and require states for the first time to contribute to SNAP
In Oklahoma, nearly 1 in 4 residents are on Medicaid, and about 17% of people receive food stamps.
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said state leaders don’t have enough certainty from Congress to cut taxes right now.
“We won’t know the federal budget until after session, so we are making decisions in a vacuum,” she said.
Even without tax cuts, Oklahoma would still struggle to cover any federal cost shifts, she said.
Kirt said the federal government has sent states billions in pandemic relief dollars. That has propped up budgets, not prudent planning, she said.
But Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who supports the cut, said he isn’t worried about the federal uncertainty.
“I don’t think it is going to impact this budget year,” Paxton said. “If anything happens, it will be down the road and give us time to plan for it.”
Republicans say the state has about $3.5 billion in savings.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said Oklahoma voters a few years ago approved Medicaid expansion and enshrined it in the state Constitution, so the legislators must pay for it even if the federal government does not, she said.
“There is a lot of uncertainty with what’s happening at the federal level,” she said.
Ervin, with the Policy Institute, said it will be difficult for Oklahoma lawmakers to raise taxes if revenue is needed in the future.
In 1992, voters passed State Question 640 that required a three-fourths vote in both chambers or a vote of the people to raise taxes, something which has only been done once in three decades.
Ervin said lawmakers’ first instinct would be to cut services and or rely on savings before raising taxes.
“I think they will exhaust all those options before they even come close to talking about raising taxes,” Ervin said.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Judging by all the backpatting we witnessed last week, Oklahoma’s Republican legislative leaders want us to believe their latest budget deal will make our state a beacon of prosperity .
In reality, it feels a lot like the opposite.
It appears Oklahomans ended up with a budget agreement negotiated behind closed doors by a small group of influential lawmakers and lobbyists that got their hearts’ desires at our expense. And, it appears this is a budget that has been crafted in a vacuum by people completely oblivious to the giant pile of flaming dog doo that Congress appears poised to leave on our doorstep. (Maybe that fire is the light from the previously mentioned beacon.)
I couch this all with “appears” because 99.99% of us have no idea how Oklahoma’s budget was created.
Last year, Oklahomans for the first time were able to watch budget negotiations play out in real time during a series of public hearings. While those conversations at times were as dull as watching paint dry, they really helped the public — including the media — understand how the deal was reached. And, they helped curtail lobbyists’ influence.
Unfortunately, the House and Senate legislative leaders who championed that strategy termed out or lost reelection. They were replaced by new leaders who, disappointingly, decided to scrap that process and largely revert to conducting budget talks in meetings that aren’t publicly accessible.
So we don’t know why – after years of resistance – that this is the year lawmakers chose to bow to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s pressure to cut the state’s income tax. The expected impact of the 0.25% cut on state coffers varies greatly depending on who you ask.
The timing is a headscratcher because Congress is planning cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps, that could require states like ours to foot the difference. Not to mention that pesky inflation that while slowing has not disappeared.
That $3.5 billion that lawmakers are bragging about having in savings isn’t going to last long if the federal government decides to require our state to pay for federal programs that help low-income residents. Ours is the sixth poorest state after all.
I don’t understand why our Legislature doesn’t want to wait until the dust settles in D.C. before making tax cuts. After all, to raise taxes requires a supermajority legislative vote or a vote of the people. 
Maybe lawmakers are focused on political points for the moment. But cutting taxes now could leave future Legislatures in a precarious financial position. It wasn’t long ago that Oklahoma lawmakers cut taxes and then had to plug a $1 billion shortfall. During that time, in 2018, they had to cut services and even had to raise taxes on gas and diesel, cigarettes and gross production.
I’d rather any savings from Stitt’s tax cut be invested in fixing our pothole-ridden public roadways or boosting teacher salaries so we can get more qualified educators in our classrooms. 
Or perhaps we could invest it in growing other state agencies’ budgets. Most of those will remain flat next year, which would be great, except for the fact that everything is getting more expensive. That means they’re getting cut.
Lawmakers increased public school funding by $25 million, but allocated double that in new money to private schools, which serve only a small fraction of school children. In exchange for that $25 million, public schools will be required to add an instructional day to their school calendar, which will pretty much eliminate any financial benefit from that windfall. Private schools face no such requirement.
But even beyond that, this budget inexplicably contains over $750 million in special interest projects.
Instead of requiring the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University to fundraise to feed their ambitions, lawmakers think taxpayers should foot the $200 million bill to build OU’s new pediatric heart hospital and spend $250 million so OSU can improve its College of Veterinary Medicine.
Taxpayers are being asked to subsidize those projects at the same time our state’s CareerTech is slated to see its budget reduced by about 8.8%, or by over $17 million. 
CareerTech is an entity that provides career and technical training to over 520,000 Oklahomans each year, preparing them to work in many of our professions that don’t require a traditional college degree, but face critical shortages. Health care would be one of those.
Maybe we should fund that and our other core government services adequately before spending $312 million to buy a private prison in Lawton. That purchase sounds like a terrible investment for a state whose voters have signaled at the ballot box that they want to reduce our state’s incarceration rates. There wouldn’t be a need to buy more prisons if lawmakers are taking that missive seriously.
Most years these budget agreements sail through the Legislature, but there are plenty of new faces in the Capitol this year that have proven that they’re not afraid to challenge the status quo. 
No budget agreement should ever be a done deal without giving Oklahomans time to weigh in. 
Like all budgets, it will still need to clear the committee process, be voted on by both chambers and be acted upon by Stitt. Lawmakers have until 5 p.m. May 30 to pass one.
So here’s hoping that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle take the time to listen to their constituents and that they’re thinking critically about whether all the components of this budget along with the proposed tax cut best position our state for success in future years.

(Photo courtesy of the Center for Employment Opportunities)When Karina Lariz was released from a California prison in September 2021, she had only the clothes she was arrested in — stretched out and weathered by time. She had lost her home, her car and her job. Her two children had moved in with other family members.
“I didn’t have nothing, everything that I had within those two weeks of coming home was what I found in donation bins,” recalled Lariz, who was incarcerated for three years. She added: “I was so worried about, ‘How am I going to get to these different programs? Where am I going to sleep at?’”
After her release, Lariz spent two days at a motel before moving into a transitional home. She also participated in a job training program.
Then came an unexpected lifeline: direct cash payments through a nonprofit program called the Returning Citizens Stimulus. The Center for Employment Opportunities, an organization that offers reentry support and services to formerly incarcerated people in 28 cities, runs the program.
With the money, Lariz, 35, was able to buy clothes for job interviews, cover groceries and public transportation fare, and begin rebuilding her life and relationships. The money, totaling nearly $2,500 over three payments, helped her gain footing in the weeks following her release — a period often marked by high risk of recidivism and reincarceration.
“It liberated a lot of stress,” she said.
Now, a new independent evaluation of the initiative suggests that short-term aid may have positive long-term effects. The study comes as some states are considering whether direct financial support is an effective — or appropriate — tool for reducing recidivism.
In 2022, Lariz landed a job with the very organization that helped fund her reentry. She now works as a program associate on the organizing team at the Center for Employment Opportunities, where she helps others leaving prison.
Nearly four years after her release, Lariz is married and again living with her two children.
“If I didn’t have that support, I would have not pushed myself to do half of the things that I did,” Lariz said.
She is one of more than 10,000 formerly incarcerated people across 28 cities who received support through the Center for Employment Opportunities’ stimulus program, which launched in April 2020.
The national organization works with local agencies to distribute up to $2,750 in cash over 60 days, contingent on participants completing basic milestones, such as creating a resume or attending a job readiness workshop. More than 80% of participants complete their milestones and receive the full payments.
People leaving prison often face staggering rates of joblessness, homelessness and food insecurity. Most program participants used the funds to cover food, rent, utilities or public transportation fare. Some participants also used the money to pay off credit card and medical debt.
“The basics of survival are this acute challenge in those early days of reentry, and then you layer on that sort of the big structural challenges,” said Sam Schaeffer, the executive director and CEO of the Center for Employment Opportunities. “Just putting food on the table, just getting to work, just getting that set of interview clothes is so critical.”
The new study supports that assessment.
According to the study — which was conducted by MDRC, a research organization focusing on poverty reduction — participants were significantly less likely to violate parole than peers who did not receive payments. Within the first six months after release, parole violations fell by more than 41%, with violent parole violations dropping by 64%. The study evaluated the outcomes of people who were released in 2020 in Los Angeles and Alameda counties in California.
Roughly 77 million Americans — or about 1 in 3 adults — have a criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. That includes records of arrests, charges and criminal convictions. Formerly incarcerated people often face stigma and major barriers in the job market.
They also often return home without savings or financial resources and earn less than half as much as peers who have never been incarcerated over their careers, according to a 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning law and policy institute at the New York University School of Law.
 Legislation and pilot programs

A bill introduced in the New York legislature earlier this year would create a reentry fund to offer cash payments of $425 each month for up to six months for eligible residents leaving prison. The bill has been stalled in committee since January and is unlikely to pass before the legislature adjourns in June.
Some critics say that the proposed New York program is a redundant and unrestricted handout for people with criminal records, and question whether limited public safety funds should support individuals already eligible for state services, including Medicaid, food assistance, job placement programs and housing aid.
“This is just one more element of what is an overall theme by the Democrats here in Albany to coddle criminals and put their priorities over the priorities of victims and law-abiding citizens,” New York state Sen. George Borrello, a Republican, told Stateline.
This isn’t the first time states have considered offering stipends to people leaving prison.
Most recently, legislators in Colorado in 2024 and North Carolina in 2023 proposed bills that would have provided monthly payments to formerly incarcerated individuals. Neither bill made it out of its originating chamber, but both bills proposed up to $3,000 in support.
In Colorado, the pilot program would have offered money for basic living expenses to those who enrolled in workforce training programs following incarceration in a state facility. In North Carolina, the proposal would have provided monthly stipends for housing, food, clothing and transportation for up to six months after release.
Similar pilot cash assistance programs have launched in New Haven, Connecticut; Gainesville, Florida; and Philadelphia.
The Gainesville program, which ran from January 2022 to February 2023, had 115 participants. They received $1,000 in the first month, followed by monthly payments of $600. An impact report released in February found that participants experienced greater financial security, reduced mental stress and lower rates of recidivism.
 Potential savings

In 2022 — the most recent year with available data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual survey of state and local government finances — state governments spent $58 billion to incarcerate more than 1 million people in state facilities.
Forty-four percent of all state prison admissions in 2021 were people who violated the terms of their parole or probation sentences, according to a 2024 report by the Council of State Governments Justice Center. On any given day, 1 in 4 people in state prison were incarcerated due to supervision violations — costing states more than $10 billion collectively.
Some critics maintain that the most effective way to prevent crime is to punish those who break the law.
“We do not do enough to hold people accountable,” said Borrello, the New York state senator who opposes the bill that would create a reentry fund in his state. “I really don’t give any credence to [supporters’] thoughts on whether or not they think this is going to save money down the road.”
For people such as Karina Lariz, though, the impact is personal and profound.
“I’ve been able to redefine and find who I am today, like the real Karina — not the Karina that grew up in trauma and all the problems that I had before incarceration,” she said.

Green River Rep. Marlene Brady is leading the charge on prohibiting cities, towns and counties from paying dues to elected officials’ associations. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers go after funding for state associations that sometimes oppose their bills appeared first on WyoFile .","As the Wyoming Legislature has shifted further to the right in recent years, the conservative concept of local control has lost sway in debates over several topics, including guns, education and taxes. 
Now, some state lawmakers want more say over local governments’ spending on dues to associations that advocate on their behalf. 
“Elimination of publicly funded associations prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to fund private entities that may prioritize their own interests over those of the public,” Rep. Marlene Brady, R-Green River, told the May 9 Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee in Lander. 
Endorsed by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus last summer, Brady is leading the charge on a proposal to prohibit cities, towns and counties from using public funds to cover elected officials’ membership in associations.
“We’ve also seen that they go and they use our dime, the taxpayer dime, to go and lobby against every one of the bills that the people put forward,” Brady told the committee. “That is unacceptable. We are tired of it.”
Organizations like the Wyoming County Commissioners Association and the Wyoming Association of Municipalities lobby in Cheyenne during the session on behalf of local officials and based on priorities agreed to by their memberships. 
Earlier this year, those associations — alongside firefighters, law enforcement, community colleges and special districts — cautioned lawmakers on passing certain property tax cuts whose cost local governments will shoulder.

Organizations like WCCA and WAM also provide education, training and networking opportunities. Those services, in particular, are an invaluable resource, according to the more than 20 local officials from across the state who testified at the May 9 meeting. That included mayors, commissioners, county attorneys, county treasurers, county clerks and district court clerks. 
Pinedale Mayor Matt Murdock was among them. He recalled to the committee his first Wyoming Association of Municipalities conference more than a decade ago. 
“I got to tell you, it was amazing,” Murdock said. “I learned how to do open meetings. I learned how to navigate ethics rules, budget responsibilities … It is practical, nonpartisan and frankly, empowering.”
When Murdock sees “people trying to quiet the dissenting voice, when they try to quiet the local voice, it just irks the heck out of me,” he added. 
Despite overwhelming testimony against the prohibition, the committee decided by a straw poll to continue the topic at its August meeting in Casper. 
As part of that discussion, the committee will review a bill from 2021 to prohibit the use of tax revenue for lobbying, per a request from Rep. Ann Lucas, R-Cheyenne.
Associations
Government associations play important roles in the legislative process, advocates say.
“We see ourselves as providing a bridge between legislative intent and practical implementation,” Natalia Macker, Wyoming County Commissioners Association president and Teton County commissioner, told lawmakers. 
With four staff members, Macker said, the association focuses on areas of taxation, infrastructure, public safety, health and human services and land use.
“We offer input from counties that have a wide variety of perspectives and help gather that for you so that you can use it in your decision making,” she said. “We also help provide analysis to ensure we avoid unfunded mandates and unintended consequences. We receive requests from the [Legislative Service Office,] from legislative committees, from individual legislators and from state agencies. We also work together with federal agencies and our federal delegation.”
Asked how the organization is funded, Macker said it’s a combination of membership dues, private sector partners and several of its own revenue-generating streams. 
As for membership dues, Macker said it depends on the county. Smaller counties pay less, larger counties pay more. Teton County’s annual dues, Macker said, will be around $36,000 in the upcoming fiscal year. 
Without the association, Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, asked how smaller counties would fare. 
“Financially, it would put a terrible burden on us if we weren’t part of the association,” Weston County Commissioner Ed Wagner said, echoing several other officials from smaller communities who told lawmakers they either did not have the staff or funding to substitute the services associations provide to them.

Like the county association, the Wyoming Association of Municipalities uses a sliding scale when determining membership dues. 
“The City of Casper, which is probably one of the larger due payers, as you might imagine, pays roughly $55,000 a year,” Casper City Manager and WAM President Carter Napier told the committee. 
That cost amounts to roughly 0.028% of Casper’s 2025 budget of $193 million. The town of Shoshoni, meanwhile, pays a “few hundred a year,” Napier said.
“I don’t know how you get a more efficient expenditure of a taxpayer dollar to receive the services, that are premium services, for the same kind of same kind of money,” Napier said. 
Even as one of Wyoming’s largest cities, Casper Mayor Ray Pacheco told lawmakers his community also relies on WAM to track legislation, provide legal clarity and help interpret and implement new policy.
“Let me be clear, this is not just about small towns. This is about local control. I’m going to say that again, this is about local control,” Pacheco said. 
“This is about our ability to govern ourselves as guaranteed by the Wyoming Constitution. When we prohibit cities and towns from voluntarily joining associations like WAM, we weaken that self-governance. We isolate communities and we make it harder, not easier, for local governments to do their jobs.”
Opposition
The two hours’ worth of testimony from local officials did little to sway  Brady, the lawmaker leading the charge on the proposal. Instead, she accused them of having dishonest motivations. 
“I would venture to guess that everyone [who] testified this morning in support of the associations is being paid,” Brady said. 
Brady also clarified that she was not necessarily against the existence of associations, but opposed tax dollars funding them. Instead, local officials should pay for such services out of pocket. 
“The local elected officials, I feel, are given enough salary that I would hope they’d be able to get together and come to some kind of, just work together [for] what’s best for their communities,” Brady said. 
When Brady said 18 states have banned taxpayer dollars from funding associations, Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, followed up.

“My question to you is, where are you getting that information? Who’s providing it to you? Because it’s wrong,” Landen said, pointing to the National Conference of State Legislatures website that indicated otherwise. 
“States just don’t do this,” he said. 
Brady did not say where her information was from but told the committee she would provide a hard copy of her source.
Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, asked Brady in two different iterations whether the state ought to determine the budgets of local governments. She did not provide a direct answer. However, Rep. Gary Brown, R-Cheyenne, eventually weighed in, pointing to Article 4, Section 14 of the Wyoming Constitution. 
“The Legislature shall provide by law for examination of the accounts of state treasurer, supreme court clerks, district court clerks, and all county treasurers, and treasurers of such other public institutions as the legislature may prescribe,” it reads. 
“The Constitution of Wyoming does give the Legislature the oversight of all accounts in the state,” Brown said. “So yes, we need to be looking at those.”
Yin pushed back on the suggestion with a quip. 
“I’m excited to do more micromanagement,” Yin said. 
The committee’s next meeting is Aug. 14 in Casper.

A riotously amusing program in which trained actors perform plays written by elementary students got gouged by Trump’s funding cuts, but debuts new plays Thursday.
The post Despite funding cut, the show goes on for Laramie’s elementary school playwrights appeared first on WyoFile .","“The Moose,” a debut production from Wyoming’s newest playwriting sensation Axel, is a tale of conflict and loss.
Actors from Sheridan’s WYO Theater are rehearsing the performance ahead of a Thursday night curtain raising at the University of Wyoming’s Thrust Theater, which seats 245 people. It’s not yet public which of the troupe’s actors will take on the starring roles: that of the hapless Tim, and that of the moose, named Moose, who (spoiler alert) ousts him from his home.
Over three scenes, Tim tries to win his home back through force (a boxing match), trickery and pleading. 
During a break in production work on a recent Friday afternoon, a WyoFile reporter had the chance to ask Axel about the inspiration behind his play — the kind of darkly tinged tale where the good guy might not necessarily win.
“I wear a moose hat a lot,” the playwright said. “Like almost every day.”
Axel is 10, but almost 11. He’s a fifth grader at Rock River Elementary School, a small rural community around 40 miles north of Laramie.

He wrote “The Moose” through the Play/Write program, an arts education initiative of Laramie nonprofit theater company Relative Theatrics. (WyoFile editor Tennessee Watson is a former board member of Relative Theatrics.) Play/Write today operates in three Albany County elementary schools, where students learn the basic building blocks of writing plays and understanding theater. The curriculum builds toward its annual climax — Thursday’s showcase of 10 plays written by elementary school students and performed by theater groups of various age groups. 
Besides Axel’s play, UW acting students will also perform Wooly Story, written by Karter, who is one grade below Axel at Rock Creek Elementary. Wooly is a cowboy rapper, and a sheep. Karter’s play centers on the efforts of two best friends, Addie and Layla, to attend his concert and ultimately hypnotize Wooly into a dance party. 
(Play/Write asked WyoFile not to use the minor students’ last names, to protect their digital privacy.) 
Another play delves into the psyche of chess pieces — a king grows insecure about the fact that the queen is really the most powerful piece on the board, and seeks to undermine her reputation in the press. 
The play’s authors have not seen their work performed. They will get their first look at how the adults interpreted their characters and storylines Thursday morning, before the evening’s showcase, which is free and open to the public. 
At the 2024 showcase, actors from Relative Theatrics performed a play by a Spring Creek Elementary School fifth grader named Amelia about a group of inanimate objects who together ponder whether they’re alive.

“They got very creative with it,” Amelia tells Relative Theatrics founder Anne Mason after the show, in an interview posted to YouTube. “The jokes were very funny and a lot of people laughed,” Amelia said, “and I didn’t realize that as I was writing the play.” 
Though only some students’ plays get produced for the showcase, every student’s play is published and archived. This year, the program expanded for its second year in Rock River, where the students wrote and produced a play together that they will perform Thursday. The day WyoFile visited the Play/Write program at the Laramie Plains Civic Center, Play/Write founder Will Bowling was teaching Axel a computer program for capturing sounds and music to enhance that performance. 
Bowling is a theatre professional who moved to Laramie in 2021 and brought Play/Write to Wyoming with him. It’s modeled after a program he helped found in 2010, during a prior life in New Orleans. By the time Bowling decamped to Albany County, that program had spread into school districts all around that fabled city of writers and musicians. 
Bowling approached Mason and pitched the idea, explaining he saw a need for additional arts education in the local school system that didn’t cost school districts more funding. Relative Theatrics, he said, could serve as a “third-party arts education provider.” After a year of fundraising, the program launched in two elementary schools in 2023. Bowling hopes to expand into one or two more schools next year. Ultimately, he wants Play/Write to serve as a model for programs in other Wyoming counties.

Bowling has funded the program through a mix of federal, state and private funding streams. Like so much of the public arts in America, he’s seen a swathe of funding cut by President Donald Trump’s administration. That includes a $10,000 grant that he was awarded for this year, but which he said the federal government never actually sent to Relative Theatrics. The federal money represents around 15% of Play/Write’s budget. The cut came, Bowling said, to the Challenge America program, which the National Endowment for the Arts ended under the Trump administration. 
The program existed to support “historically underserved communities that have limited access to the arts relative to geography, ethnicity, economics, and/or disability,” according to a previous federal description of the program found online. 
“For Wyoming, that includes rural,” said Bowling, who was elected to the Laramie city council in 2024. “But those words are now synonymous with diversity, equity and inclusion,” he said — terms that the Trump administration has done its best to wipe out of federal funding programs. 
Bowling worries for other arts programs that don’t have cute kids writing funny plays to tout when they go knocking at the doors of donors. But Play/Write will continue to expand, he said. 
“Arts and culture and the cultural economy are like the fundamental underpinnings of a good communally and civically engaged society,” Bowling said. “And no matter if your kid grows up to be an engineer or to be a performing artist, the arts provide an entry point into educational rigor and achievement that is really unique.”
Take Axel and “The Moose.”
When Axel first began penning his script, the words flowed unhindered, he told WyoFile. “The start of the play was really easy,” Axel said. “I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted the boxing fight.”
But at a peer-to-peer writing session, Axel got mixed up over the development of a girl moose character, named Mooseabelle. He was stumped by a question from his peer about the connection between Moose and Mooseabelle. Were they siblings? Was it a romance?
Axel, who wishes he had a sister, settled on siblings. The writing went on, though not without its fits and starts. 
At one point, “I deleted two entire pages, because it wasn’t any good,” Axel said.
Welcome to the writing life, Axel. We at WyoFile extend our deepest sympathies.

The Michigan Board of State Canvassers approved summary language for a second proof-of-citizenship ballot initiative, setting the state’s voters up to weigh in not only on whether they want such a requirement in the state Constitution but also on how strict they want those requirements to be.
Americans for Citizen Voting won unanimous support from the board Friday for a 99-word summary of its new ballot initiative, and can soon begin collecting the nearly 450,000 signatures from registered voters that are required to get the question on the 2026 ballot
The proof-of-citizenship proposal from ACV, a product of the Virginia-based libertarian Liberty Initiative Fund, follows another one from the Committee to Protect Voters’ Rights, which won unanimous board approval last month for the summary of its proposal.
The two initiatives are similar: Both would require new voters — and possibly currently registered voters — to prove their U.S. citizenship, , and both would eliminate the option for voters who lack a photo ID to sign an affidavit attesting to their identity.
Still, board members focused mainly on the differences between the proposals.
The ACV proposal, for instance, could set Michigan up to maintain two separate voter lists, as Arizona does — one for those who have proven their citizenship and can vote in all elections, and one for those who haven’t and who could only vote only in federal races. The proposal also introduces penalties for registrants and election officials who violate its provisions.
Both Republican and Democratic members of the bipartisan board expressed concerns about the intent of the second initiative. Richard Houskamp, a Republican and the chair of the board, said he feared the proposed penalties would allow for “weaponizing” against other voters. Board Vice Chair Mary Ellen Gurewitz, a Democrat, said she believed the proposal would have “a seriously injurious effect on the voters of Michigan.”
Voters “ought to understand that your proposal is dramatically different from the one that we previously considered,” Gurewitz said to representatives of Americans for Citizen Voting.
But the board’s obligation at Friday’s hearing was to finalize the summary language that appears on petitions. State law requires the summary to be not more than 100 words, accurate in its description of the proposal, unbiased, and written “using words that have a common everyday meaning to the general public.” Petitioners are allowed to gather signatures without getting their language approved by the board, but most opt to come before the canvassers to ensure their effort isn’t later thrown out for not meeting those requirements.
Getting to accurate and unbiased language took several hours. Board members debated among themselves and with representatives from both ACV and CPVR on what should be included.
“I think what’s been done to the summary is a fair way to put it in front of Michigan voters,” Houskamp said of the proposal summary.
While the summary was approved, the form it will appear on was not: After a few typos were discovered in the proposed amendment to the constitution, ACV withdrew its request for approval of the form and said it will bring it back for approval in June.
The twin ballot proposals in Michigan are part of a conservative push across the country to require voters to prove their citizenship before registering to vote or casting a ballot. Michigan Republicans have focused on the effort since at least the fall, when a University of Michigan student from China was found to have cast a ballot in the November election despite not being a citizen. A further review from the state found 15 other noncitizens who may have cast a ballot in the general election.
House Republicans first introduced a proposal to amend the constitution earlier this year that would require voters to show documentary proof of citizenship, but it so far has failed to gain enough support to move to the Senate. The Citizens to Protect Voters’ Rights initiative is nearly identical to that proposal.
To get on the ballot in 2026, each petition initiative would need to get nearly 450,000 signatures from registered voters. If both make it, and both win approval from a majority of voters, the one with more yes votes would be the one that amends the Michigan Constitution.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The final 10-day countdown has begun for the Nebraska Legislature’s 2025 session, with little time or funding to enact a slew of designated priorities.
Every year, all 49 state senators get to designate one bill as a “priority” for the year. Committee chairs get an additional two priority bills, and the speaker of the Legislature gets 25 extra priorities, usually reserved for non-controversial measures. 
This year, there are 106 priority bills or constitutional amendments. All but 10 priority proposals have been reported out of various legislative committees or are in a separate package.
The system is meant to help streamline the limited time in 90-day sessions in odd years and 60-day sessions in even years. Of lawmaker priorities, 39 have passed and 21 are one round of voting away from passage — including a bill related to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits that will have a veto override vote Monday afternoon.


Status of 2025 lawmaker priority proposals, as of May 15

Still in committee: 11 proposals (one identical to a measure on the final stage of debate).
First stage of debate: 19 proposals (of those, one failed, one is in a package).
Second stage of debate: 17 proposals (of those, two failed, one is in a package).
Final stage of debate: 20 proposals (of those, one failed).
Awaiting the governor’s signature: 21 proposals.
Vetoed: 1 proposal (veto override motion filed).
Signed into law: 17 proposals.



In Nebraska, with just one legislative chamber, bills move through three rounds of debate. Lumping together priority bills and all other measures passed this year, a total of 136 bills had passed the Legislature and another 34 more were one step away from passage heading into the final 10 days. These totals would be higher if they separated out the number of bills that have been packaged together.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista, who sets the daily agenda, said it was “very unusual” for at least half of priority bills to be stuck in committee when lawmakers moved March 31 to all-day debate.
However, he said, lawmakers had an opportunity to work through many “good government” bills as they advanced from committee, which he said helped a large freshman class learn the ropes.
“It isn’t just me sitting in my office deciding what’s going to be scheduled, what isn’t going to be scheduled,” Arch said. “The input that I seek from the sponsor and those in opposition kind of tells me, especially the sponsor, whether or not they feel that bill is ready to move.”
Uniting for the ‘common good’
Arch said relationship building among lawmakers has been crucial as senators continue making progress in what he says is “learning how to debate difficult subjects” since he took the reins in the 2023 session — an 88-day session marked by rampant filibusters and partisan rancor. 
That progress is important, he said, because debate shapes final policy decisions.
“We still have strong passion. We still have hurt feelings. We still have strong opinions on what is the right policy,” Arch said. “But how we have handled ourselves, and how we have improved in that area, I think, has been encouraging to me, and I think encouraging to the body.”

State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, joined on day 59 of the 2023 session, calling it a “low bar.” Compared to then, she said, 2025 has been “OK.”
Bosn said all senators “wholeheartedly” want what they think is best for Nebraska, and while there are disagreements, 2025 has featured respect, decorum and compromises.
“I think we’ve had hiccups and then we have moments where we come together and work towards what we can all say is a common good on a lot of things,” Bosn said.
‘I have the clock’
However, some progressive colleagues to Bosn and Arch disagreed that 2025 has improved from 2023, such as State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who defined the 2025 session as working against Nebraskans and “stripping away” recent investments or deals.
“In a lot of ways, I think it’s going to cause a lot of harm, especially when you look at us becoming a ‘felony factory,’” McKinney said, quoting a phrase from State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha as the Legislature creates or expands some felony crimes.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who led the 2023 logjam, has again pledged to weaponize the limited time on those she says have brushed off Nebraskans, such as watering down voter-approved paid sick leave and minimum wage laws. In 2023, she slowed the process to a crawl by talking for days on end, including on noncontroversial bills.
“You have the votes, but I have the clock,” Cavanaugh said last week, aimed at Republicans.
Lawmaker priorities
Part of the balancing act in the final 10 days of 2025 involves the state budget for the next two years. With the expected passage of Legislative Bill 513, to give all judges 1.5% raises each of the next two years, lawmakers have $1.1 million to possibly spend on other priorities.
The governor has until midnight on Wednesday to offer any line-item vetoes to the state budget, which could increase the amount of funds lawmakers have access to.
  State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha. July 21, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
As the session draws to a close by June 9, the window for some measures to move forward is tight and will largely depend on how Arch designs the remaining schedule. Typically, the final day is reserved for possible veto overrides, or lawmakers can adjourn early if none are needed. Bills would need to pass by June 2, the 89th day, to leave time for a veto override if needed.
Some lawmakers’ priority bills will also be filibustered, taking up hours that could jam up the remaining days and place some bills out of reach.
Priority bills left behind
All bills not killed or passed this year can continue in 2026, alongside a new slate of legislation. 
Arch said he hasn’t yet decided what could happen with 2025 priority bills that don’t reach a conclusion this year, as he waits to see how many, if any, are left behind and could find a way back into focus next year.
Among notable priority proposals that are left in committee, at least for now, include:

LB 156, to allow lawsuits against schools in cases of sexual assaults of children, a narrowed version of a bill vetoed in 2024, from State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln.
LB 298, to address and button-up the Legislature’s oversight of child welfare and corrections, from Arch.
LB 538, to require K-12 schools and colleges to adopt a policy and provide training to crack down on antisemitism, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering.
LB 634, to periodically review legislatively created boards, commissions, spending and more to see what can be repealed every 5 years, from Hansen.
Legislative Resolution 12CA, a constitutional amendment to limit annual property tax growth, from State Sens. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and Bob Andersen of Sarpy County.




Major proposals that could be fought or delayed in final days of 2025 session
Proposals expected to be filibustered, based on filed motions or lawmaker threats, include:

Restricting lawsuits and capping damages for certain civil cases, including when a commercial vehicle injures or kills a Nebraskan (LB 79, a Judiciary Committee package led by State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse).
Increasing property tax relief by raising revenue through sales taxes and taxes on cigarettes and vapes (LB 170, from State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth).
Endorsing religious “release time” in schools and increasing a payroll tax on teachers to cover long-term substitutes and teacher retention or recruitment (LB 306, an Education Committee package led by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, the committee chair).
Banning most tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products (LB 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and prioritized by State Sen. Jared Storm of David City).
Concealing certain workplace injury reports and modifying the current standard of paying judgments or settlements in certain workers’ compensation cases (LB 455, from Hallstrom).
Lowering the minimum age for which juveniles could be detained from 13 to 11 and increasing speeding fines as part of a broad “public safety” package (LB 530, a Judiciary Committee package led by Kauth and prioritized by Bosn).
Mandating E-Verify for certain workers and requiring recipients of unemployment benefits to respond to job offers and show up to job interviews (LB 532, a Business and Labor Committee package led by Kauth, the committee chair).
Requiring the burial or cremation of aborted fetal remains (LB 632, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair and prioritized by Dan Lonowski of Hastings).
Passing a medical cannabis regulatory system (LB 677, from Hansen and prioritized by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue as chair of the General Affairs Committee).

Lawmakers are also weighing what to do with a priority bill from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, LB 258, to slow down annual voter-approved increases to the state minimum wage. The measure failed last week when one supporter missed the final vote to pass the bill. One possible path forward that some senators have discussed could be attaching it to LB 415, to weaken a minimum paid sick leave system for all state employees beginning Oct. 1.

(Photo courtesy of Northern Rockies Incident Command)A study by the University of Southern California estimates hundreds of thousands of pounds of toxic metals have been dumped onto forests during aerial fire retardant drops during the past decade, and, according to a new federal lawsuit filed against the U.S. Forest Service, could potentially harm wildlife, specifically endangered and threatened species.
The bright red fire retardant, often seen being dumped from large air tankers, contains cadmium, selenium, chromium, and other metals, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by the Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics on May 7. The organization is a nonprofit made up of current and former Forest Service employees dedicated to protecting the country’s forests and reform within the agency.
“This stuff is astonishingly dirty,” said Andy Stahl, the executive director of the organization. “Why the hell are we using such a dirty retardant?”

The chemicals found in some retardants can also be fatal to aquatic life and high concentrations of the metals can be toxic to humans, too. The lawsuit focuses on the effect on wildlife, alleging the federal agencies are violating the Endangered Species Act.
“At the risk of doing the regulatory agencies job for them, Plaintiff points out the obvious – toxic metals in aerial retardant are bad for many Threatened and Endangered species,” the lawsuit reads.
The National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are also defendants in the lawsuit. The U.S. Forest Service did not respond to a request for comment.
The plaintiffs are seek acknowledgement and disclosure of the toxic metals being used, as well as biological opinions from other agencies assessing the impact of the fire retardant on threatened and endangered animals.
The USC study, which is referenced in the lawsuit, was published in 2024 after researchers bought fire retardant and put it in a mass spectrophotometer to determine the chemical make-up of the retardant.
“Based on information and belief, the Forest Service has known about the presence of some, or all, of these metals in aerial fire retardant since well before the publication of the USC study,” the lawsuit reads.
The study estimated that between 2009 and 2021, about 840,000 pounds of toxic metals were added into the environment due to fire retardant drops in the United States.
Companies only had to disclose part of their retardant formula, according to the study, necessitating the mass spectrometry test. Previous concerns around retardants mostly centered on it containing ammonium polyphosphates, which can kill wildlife.
“They’re the ones who have really blown open this issue that retardant, the Phos-Chek retardant, contains astonishingly high levels of heavy metals like cadmium,” Stahl said. “We’ve suspected that for years.”

 ‘Most expensive, least effective’

The organization filed the suit in Missoula in part due to its long association with wildland firefighting.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a Technology and Development Center in Missoula, which includes a lab where fire retardants are tested and certified. Missoula has been at the center of aerial firefighting since the 1940s.
“Missoula tends to be a focal point with fire retardant,” said Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service fire research scientist with decades of fire experience.
He also worked at the Missoula Technology and Development Center and doesn’t think fire retardant’s work.
“It’s just about the most expensive, least effective mechanism of fire suppression,” Cohen said.
Drops can be impacted by winds, which can also ground aircraft in the first place. Embers can also move over retardant lines and in a famous example, jumped over a six-lane interstate near Santa Rosa during a 2017 fire.
Direct attack on a fire, or when firefighters’ objective is to contain the blaze as quickly as possible, is also a combination of people, machines and tools. Rarely, if ever, is only one method used to work a wildfire.

Cohen said multiple studies into whether retardant drops have any impact on the perimeter of fires have shown inconclusive results as to whether or not they work.
The assumption that retardant drops are effective is a dangerous notion, especially in legal arguments, Cohen said. In a previous lawsuit filed by the ethics group, a Missoula judge ruled that fire retardant does pollute water, but allowed agencies to continue the practice.
“The judge admitted that that was happening and essentially decided against withholding the use of the retardant based on the statement, something on the order of it is conceivable that greater harm to the environment, people and their property would occur without using fire retardant and that assumes that fire retardant is effective” Cohen said. “And to me, that’s very troubling.”
For Stahl, the drops are often about optics and he went on to say the vast majority of aerial retardant drops are ineffective. They are also only used on about 5% of fires, he added.
“Some of the Missoula Fire Science researchers have said to me, quietly, we would accomplish the same damn thing if we just put red food coloring into water and dumped it out of airplanes,” Stahl said. “It would look good on CNN. It wouldn’t be bad for the environment, and it would be just as effective in fire suppression.”
 ‘The cowboy coming over the ridge’

Fighting fires is expected to get more expensive across the country as the climate turns drier and hotter.
Forestry practices in the United States have also focused on suppression, necessitating the armies of firefighters and equipment fire agencies utilize each year. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the five-year average for suppression efforts in the U.S. is about $3 billion annually.
Prescribed fires, or fires set with the purpose of clearing out fuels or other land management goals, are sometimes used as a tool by fire agencies.
Decades of suppression have left many forests overgrown and full of dead wood, generally regarded in the firefighting world as “fuel” that can make fires more intense.
Prescribed burns seek to take some of that intensity out of wildfires by removing fuels ahead of time.
But there’s a problem there too, Cohen said — the scale of prescribed burns is not nearly enough.
“Prescribed burning is pointless the way we’re doing it now,” Cohen said.

Stahl brought up the example of recent wildfires in Minnesota. Prior to European colonization, the area was an oak savannah that did not have dense forest.
“We’ve committed all the great plains to croplands and have suppressed fire, we now have forests and these in Minnesota and similar northern tier states that used to be savanna, oak grasslands, and those forests when the humidity is low and the wind is high, which, by the way, means the airplanes that dump either water or retardant can’t fly. We get these fires, and they got lots to burn, a lot of biomass to burn.”
To address the issue, Cohen said the focus should be on building and planning. He views community wildfire risk as a structure ignition problem – the way we build makes structures too easily burned. He said if more fire resistant buildings are constructed with fire resistance in mind, fire crews can have a better plan to fight fires and fewer structures will be lost.
No community can fully be fireproofed, Cohen said, but that doesn’t mean it hurts to try. The more buildings that are protected, the less limited fire resources are stretched.
“We can reduce the number of ignitions that do occur and can be matched by our fire protection,” Cohen said.
Communities across the country are updating their fire readiness and Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy has made a point of introducing legislation on the topic, including some for aerial response to fires.
The problem for some, though, is whether aerial bombardment is the most effective strategy for fighting wildfires. And whether the cost, both financially and on the environment, is worth it.
“We do it because it looks good on CNN. It’s the cowboy coming over the ridge,” Stahl said. “Everybody’s real excited. And they see the retardant bomber arrive and the red stuff come out of the plane. They think, ‘Oh, my God, we’re saved.’ Yeah, not so much.”

(Getty Images)Uncertainty over the continuation of federal fair housing grants under Trump administration cuts is keeping a West Tennessee legal aid nonprofit from helping as many clients as they typically would.
West Tennessee Legal Services provides free civil legal aid to limited-income clients in counties west of the Tennessee River, helping people secure or retain housing and meet other family safety needs.
The organization gets more than half of its housing services budget from an annual Fair Housing Initiatives Program grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to help people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination. The Fair Housing Act bars discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status and disability.
The funding helps pay for education, outreach, legal casework and investigations, Director of Special Projects Vanessa Bullock said.
Bullock served as the nonprofit’s Fair Housing Project director and was involved in these grants for many years. She said most of the housing work they do — about 50-65% — benefits people with disabilities. The organization serves around 200 West Tennessee housing clients each year and sub-grants funding to Legal Aid offices in Middle and East Tennessee for similar programs.
But on Feb. 27, West Tennessee Legal Services received a letter informing them that the remainder of their $425,000 grant for the year was terminated immediately. The grant was one of 78 fair housing grants scrapped by HUD under the cost-cutting mission of President Donald Trump’s newly named Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
The termination came with no explanation.
West Tennessee Legal Services is used to navigating presidential transitions — every four to eight years, they go through grant re-negotiation when administrations’ priorities change. This time, there was no opportunity to have those conversations, Bullock said.
“There’s been speculation about why certain grants were cut and certain ones weren’t … Did we use too many of their target words in our application when other people didn’t? We honestly don’t know,” Bullock said. “In general, it’s just further fallout from cutting things without really understanding what they’re doing, without clear reason why.”
Four fair housing organizations filed a class action lawsuit in March contesting the sudden clawback. After a judge issued a temporary restraining order, HUD reinstated funding for West Tennessee Legal Services — which was not involved in the lawsuit — and others. The judge has since dissolved the order, noting that the lawsuit should be filed in the Court of Federal Claims.
“This decision should not be read as an endorsement of the brusque and seemingly insensitive way in which the terminations were announced,” Massachusetts District Court Judge Richard G. Stearns wrote in his decision.
The housing organizations are appealing the dissolution of the restraining order, and the lower court case is stayed in the meantime, court records show. HUD has not sent out fresh termination letters as of May 16.
West Tennessee Legal Services is treating the grant as reinstated, for now, but the future remains murky. The first year of the 3-year grant ends on July 31. It’s not clear if HUD intends to renegotiate the grants for years two and three, leaving a total $850,000 in question.
HUD could not be immediately reached for comment.
The organization is stuck in limbo, preparing for the worst and hoping for the best, Bullock said. That means taking on fewer cases than they normally would. If the grant funding doesn’t come through after July 31, they will have to reallocate cases to other funding sources.
The uncertainty, she said, is causing chaos. 
“We could have helped a lot of people with the time we spent trying to figure out the fallout from this,” Bullock said.
Ripple effects go beyond fair housing
West Tennessee Legal Services’ most typical housing cases involve people of all ages with disabilities. This could mean helping people know their rights and ask for things they are entitled to, like landlord approval for their service animal, or a release from their second-floor apartment lease if a mobility impairment forces them to seek more accessible housing, Bullock said.
Other disabilities are not as easily seen. The nonprofit helps people who are in recovery from addiction — considered a disability under the Fair Housing Act — find housing despite rental histories tarnished by their addiction and past behavior. They also help survivors of domestic violence either terminate leases to seek new housing or get other reasonable accommodations like additional locks. 
Current clients will be taken care of, Bullock said. They may not even be aware that future funding is at risk. But moving those cases to other eligible funding sources has ripple effects.
“It’s not necessarily going to affect just housing funds. It’s going to affect our whole organization, to some extent, because we’re going to be taking funds that our family law unit might have been using to do family law work to do some housing work,” Bullock explained. 










The loss of (funding) for our agencies, plus the loss of the Tennessee Human Rights Commission happening at the same time is going to lead to people falling into the cracks,


– Vanessa Bullock, West Tennessee Legal Services


The biggest impact will be for future clients that they will have to turn away, she said.
Tennessee’s recent law disbanding the Tennessee Human Rights Commission and moving its functions into the Attorney General’s Office compounds the confusion, Bullock added.
By law, the Attorney General’s Office has until June 30 to reassign the now-defunct commission’s caseload. 
“The loss of (funding) for our agencies, plus the loss of the Tennessee Human Rights Commission happening at the same time is going to lead to people falling into the cracks,” Bullock said.
Tennessee House passes measure to dissolve state human rights commission

Another consequence of the potential funding loss could be felt by congressional offices and HUD itself, West Tennessee Legal Services Executive Director Ashley Holliday said. 
The nonprofit’s screening process helps educate people about their rights, what the Fair Housing Act protects, and what proof is needed for a successful case, Bullock said. If West Tennessee Legal Services has less resources to take calls and provide education to tenants and landlords alike, those calls are likely to end up going to congressional representatives and HUD instead.
“Frankly, we’re constituent services,” Holliday said. “When congressmen get calls from constituents saying, ‘I can’t get my Social Security case handled, I need help,’ we’re one of the agencies that they send their constituents to … This obviously affects the services that we can provide.”

A 2023 Arkansas law requires third graders who fail to meet literacy standards to be held back beginning with the 2025-26 school year, but the rules haven't been written yet. (Getty Images)Arkansas students entering the third grade at public schools and open enrollment charter schools this fall will be the first cohort to be retained if they don’t meet literacy expectations, a policy established by the 2023 LEARNS Act.
“By the beginning of the 2025-2026 school year, if a public school student has not met the third-grade reading standard, as defined by the state board, or the student does not have a good-cause exemption, as provided under this subsection, the student shall not be promoted to fourth grade,” the law states.
This new requirement could have extreme implications, considering a 2024 assessment showed that only about 36% of the state’s third graders could read proficiently.



Would the state of Arkansas really require all but 36% of the state’s public school third graders to be held back? It’s currently unclear.



State education officials haven’t yet set the new literacy standard by which third-grade reading will be measured for the 2025-2026 academic year.
Kimberly Mundell, spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Education, didn’t answer specific questions about how the policy would play out.



“The law affects this school year’s second graders, who will be third graders next year,” Mundell said. “More information and details will be provided in the future.”



The LEARNS Act — a 2023 law that overhauled K-12 education with increased teacher pay, a controversial school voucher system and new volunteer requirements for public school students — tasked the State Board of Education with establishing the literacy standard for third graders.
Alisha Price, associate legal counsel for the state education department, said the nine-member board hasn’t yet crafted rules related to the literacy requirements, but it will be discussed this year.



“These rules have not started the drafting process but will soon,” Price said. “It usually takes a few months to go on a board agenda for approval, then public comment, but I do not yet have an estimate on that date.”



As with other requirements set by the Arkansas LEARNS Act, mandatory retention for third graders who fail to meet reading standards applies only in public schools. Private school and homeschool students are exempt.
Annual comprehensive testing typically occurs in April and May, near the end of the academic year. The current round of testing is expected to end Friday.
While the standard for next year isn’t set, data from an existing assessment — the Arkansas Teaching and Learning Assessment System (ATLAS) — showed that most third graders had not achieved proficiency, and had only a basic literacy understanding in 2024.
ATLAS replaced the ACT Aspire assessment that was used from third to 10th grade from 2016 through 2023. Last year was the first time school districts used ATLAS. State education officials have said the assessment created a new baseline that should not be compared to previous methods.
Of 250 public school districts included in state ATLAS data, a dozen reported that at least half of its third graders tested at the lowest level for reading, meaning students showed limited skills. Low reading scores also typically correlated to low English language arts (ELA) scores, another component of literacy testing within ATLAS.
Among the lower performers was Blytheville School District in Mississippi County, where 70% of its 109 students showed a limited understanding of reading and another 26% showed a basic understanding. According to last year’s state ATLAS data, only about five Blytheville third graders could read proficiently. The same data was reported for the school’s English language arts scores.
Last week, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said he intended to recommend to members of the State Board of Education that Blytheville School District should receive the highest level of state support due to declining enrollment and administrative challenges, the Arkansas Advocate reported.
Little Rock School District, which had the highest number of third graders in the state in 2024  — more than 1,500 — reported one in three children had only limited reading skills last year. The district’s English language arts scores matched within a few percentage points of its reading results. How those figures will compare to new literacy standards remains to be seen.
States have authority over day-to-day operations and curriculum standards in schools, making apples-to-apples comparisons among states tricky. Though that process leads to varying standards nationwide, the National Assessment of Educational Progress — known as “the nation’s report card” — tracks average reading scores and how they change over time. These national reports focus on fourth grade reading attainment, rather than third.
The congressionally mandated program within the U.S. Department of Education reported that no states saw improvements in reading scores among fourth graders from 2022 to 2019, and Arkansas students’ average scores decreased by three points. The state’s decrease was on par with the national trend among all public school fourth graders.
While the literacy standard the State Board of Education has been tasked to establish will apply to most third graders in public schools, there are some exceptions.
The education board has already adopted rules outlined in the LEARNS Act to set good-cause exemptions for promotion to the fourth grade, such as limited English proficiency students and those with individualized education programs or 504 plans. Other exemptions include students who were previously held back, kids on an intensive literacy intervention program, or those who have received a special education referral.
According to the Pew Research Center, roughly 16% of Arkansas public school students, K-12, have a learning disability. Dyslexia is among the most common learning disabilities, and state law requires school districts to screen each student in kindergarten through third grade for dyslexia, then provide appropriate resources for their academic success.
The State Board of Education further describes the third grade retention policy in the Right to Read Act, which outlines what public school districts or open enrollment charter schools should provide for students who don’t meet the reading standard or are promoted with good-cause exemptions.
The literacy improvement plan extends beyond the classroom and into students’ homes.
According to the rules, schools must provide 90 minutes of evidence-based literacy instruction each school day, assign the students to a high-performing teacher and send legal guardians a “read-at-home” plan.
Students will also be given priority to receive a literacy tutoring grant, and have the option to participate in additional programming.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — For the second time in a month, a long-sought project to bridge a gap between recreation trails from Omaha and Lincoln has seen a setback.
On Thursday, state lawmakers gave final approval to a two-year state budget that includes several budget cuts and claws back millions in previous funding to help close a multi-million budget shortfall.

Among the previously allocated funds taken back was $3.35 million from a trail development fund, which was part of an $8.3 million earmark the Nebraska Legislature made to build an 8-mile-long trail across rural Cass County.
That trail would fill the gap between the Mo-Pac Trail, which ends in Wabash, and the trail across the Lied Bridge, which ends just south of the Platte River.
The cutback comes a couple of weeks after the Cass County Board declined to approve a route for the trail — effectively rescinding a route approval made in November — that left the future of the recreation trail project to connect eastern Nebraska trails in limbo.
Julie Harris, the executive director of Bike-Walk Nebraska, a major advocate for the Cass County link, said the loss of the $3.35 million was “a hit” but not a fatal one for the project.
“We were disappointed to see that happen, because we know the value that this project will bring economically,” Harris said. “But we respect the work state senators have to do. We know it’s a very tough job.”
Some state support remains
Another trail advocate, Gerry Oligmueller, an avid bicyclist who had served as state budget director for many years before retiring, said the fact that $5 million remains allocated for the Cass County link is “continued affirmation” of state support for the trail.
Harris said that it’s possible that private donations could make up the lost $3.35 million, but advocates first need to know the route of the trail and its anticipated cost.
Bridging the gap between the Omaha and Lincoln trails has been in the works for at least two decades but has been slowed by the inability to find a route that is acceptable to local landowners and the county board.
Unlike most hike-bike rails, the Cass County link doesn’t utilize abandoned railroad right of way, thus a pathway requiring some land in county road ditches is being proposed. That makes the project more expensive, due to the need to install culverts and rock walls to prevent erosion, and more controversial, because it crosses some rural driveways.
Cass County has a say
  On the steps of the Cass County Courthouse, a debate broke out after the county board failed to give final approval to a route for a proposed hike-bike trail across the eastern Nebraska county. (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
While Cass County is not contributing funds toward construction of the trail, it has the final say on the route because some of it uses county right of way.
The Cass County Board, at its May 6 meeting, appointed a two-member committee to work with the trail developer, the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District, in the hopes of finding an acceptable route.
At the meeting, a motion to approve the route recommended by a trail consultant and approved by the county board in November died for the lack of a “second” from another commissioner.
No other route was proposed or came up for a vote, thus leaving the route decision in limbo.
Some newly elected members of the Cass County Board have questioned the previous route chosen in November, saying it bypasses a nearby town, Murdock, and wouldn’t bring the $2.5 million in economic benefits projected.
The route chosen, Route D, would cost an estimated $10-15 million to complete, but the new commissioners suggested that another look be taken at a route that would follow a state highway and go through Murdock, which would make the trail more expensive, $24 million.
An official with the Lower Platte South NRD said that Route D was preferred by the consultant and the NRD because it was among the least expensive routes and was the least disruptive, crossing only three driveways.
No timetable was set for the subcommittee and NRD to come up with a new recommended route.

As a share of the population, Idaho has one of the highest number of veterans in the United States. Those veterans bring something Idaho desperately needs at all levels of government: firsthand experience putting mission above ego, country above faction and teamwork above personal gain. 
They understand sacrifice, discipline and the importance of making hard choices for the greater good. Imagine what a group of veterans — running as independents, free from the grip of party machines — could do for the people of Idaho, whether that is as a legislator, city council member, county commissioner or highway district commissioner.
These candidates would not be beholden to rigid platforms or state or national agendas. Instead, they would focus on local issues: improving access to affordable housing, strengthening education at the local level, supporting the transportation (including walking and biking) needs of local communities, protecting farms and water from urban encroachment and fostering economic opportunity for all Idahoans. 
Their independence would allow them to work across party lines and rebuild the trust and civility so often missing from our various seats of government, including the Statehouse.
We need veterans not just as symbols of service, but as active leaders helping reshape Idaho’s political landscape. We call on veterans across the state to consider stepping up — not as Republicans or Democrats, but as principled independents ready to serve again, this time in the helm of government at all levels.
Idaho’s future deserves leaders who understand that loyalty belongs to the people, not the party. Let’s help make that future a reality.

Jared Polis and state energy and transportation officials speak on Feb. 26, 2024. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)About $40 million a year in state funding from new transportation fees could be the key to getting a short passenger rail line from Denver to Fort Collins up and running in the next four years, Colorado officials said last week.
The project, spearheaded by Gov. Jared Polis and some of his top advisers, envisions a “joint service” between the Front Range Passenger Rail District, which eventually plans to serve cities as far south as Pueblo, and the Denver-area Regional Transportation District, which has struggled to complete a commuter line from Denver to Boulder that voters first approved more than 20 years ago.
“What we have in Colorado is a population who very much supports transit and rail, and would like to see an expansion of transit and rail, but they really need to see to believe,” Lisa Kaufmann, a senior strategic adviser to Polis, told members of the state’s Transportation Commission last week. “I think that we have a history of overpromising and not delivering rail projects in Colorado that looms large in all these conversations.”

The service would initially run three times a day between Denver and Fort Collins, with potential stops in Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville, Boulder, Longmont and Loveland. The total price tag, including operating costs and debt payments for projected capital expenditures, is estimated at $83 million a year beginning in 2029, and about half that total would be covered by dedicated revenue from the state’s new fees on rental cars and oil and gas production. RTD sales tax revenue could cover the other half, state officials said.
An intergovernmental agreement between RTD, FRPR and the Colorado Department of Transportation is being drafted and will be presented to each agency’s governing board this summer, Kaufmann said. A joint committee will then start formal negotiations with BNSF, the railroad that owns the track the service will use, over an access agreement.
The railroad giant’s price tag for the use of their tracks was a crucial factor that derailed RTD’s plans for its commuter rail line to Boulder, which voters approved as part of the FasTracks plan in 2004. Agency officials had estimated that a lease would cost $66 million, but BNSF — one half of a duopoly, with Union Pacific, that owns virtually all U.S. railroads west of the Mississippi — quoted an upfront cost of $535 million in 2011, setting the project’s timeline back by decades.
Capital costs for any passenger rail service in BNSF’s rail corridor account for station infrastructure and safety mechanisms, including a so-called positive train control system, that are not required for the freight traffic that currently uses the Denver-to-Fort Collins segment. The state’s initial financial estimates, prepared by engineering consultancy HNTB, include $198 million in expenditures on signaling and communications upgrades, $124 million for vehicles and $92 million for station infrastructure.
“They want to work with us to make this possible, but of course, they are a business that they are running, and they want to do it in a way that’s mutually beneficial,” Kaufmann told commissioners about BNSF.
“In our private conversations with them, they believe that there is more cost savings to be had, once we get into real negotiations with them, than even what we’ve priced out through our study,” she added.
Mountain rail
State officials hope the launch of the northern Front Range route will follow on the heels of a separate “mountain rail” service planned to begin daily round trips from Denver to Granby by the end of 2026. They announced earlier this month that they had negotiated an access agreement with Union Pacific in exchange for the railroad’s continued use of the state-owned Moffat Tunnel, which crosses under the Continental Divide and serves as the only link between the eastern and western halves of the state’s rail network.
The year-round mountain rail route, which could eventually extend as far as Steamboat Springs, Hayden and Craig, will aim to build on the success of the Winter Park Express, a seasonal route that takes passengers from Denver to the Winter Park ski resort and back. Operated by Amtrak, the route was revived in 2017 and reached a new high in ridership during the 2025 ski season, state officials announced Friday. Trains averaged 89% full throughout the line’s three and a half months of operation, serving a total of 43,919 riders.
“We believe that increased ridership at this level is helping to take cars off congested roadways and make everyone safer,” Sally Chafee, CDOT’s acting director, said in a press release. “It also means much lower emissions per passenger mile, so there’s a huge environmental benefit here.”
Meanwhile, officials at the Front Range Passenger Rail District are moving forward with long-term plans for service between Pueblo and Fort Collins, with a vote on a district-wide sales tax hike to fund the project coming as soon as 2026. While the Denver-to-Fort Collins “starter service” could begin by 2029, a “full build” may still be decades away.
The district last week launched a virtual open house to invite Coloradans to give feedback on its service development plan, which it will complete by the end of this year. Out of five different alternatives studied by CDOT and FRPR staff, the district is recommending a plan that envisions a “full build” of 10 daily round trips along the proposed line by 2045. Members of the public are invited to share their thoughts on the alternatives analysis before June 15.
“This is an opportunity to better understand the recommended alternative and ask questions about the Service Development Plan,” said Chrissy Breit, FRPR’s interim general manager. “Community input is vital to shaping a transportation solution that reflects the region’s needs and priorities.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)In 2010, Rhode Island attempted a lively experiment in health care costs by limiting how much hospitals could increase the prices they charge. 
Fifteen years later, a new study led by a team of Brown University researchers suggests the hospital price growth mandate worked, not only cutting hospital prices directly, but flowing downstream to lower consumer spending on health plan premiums. 
By 2022, fully insured plan premiums in Rhode Island were $1,000 lower per member annually than they would have been without the cap, and hospitals saw a 9.1% average price drop between 2010 and 2022, according to the study published May 5 in the journal Health Affairs.
“No other states in recent history had attempted to regulate commercial prices in this way,” Andrew Ryan, the study’s lead author and a professor of health services, policy and practice at Brown’s School of Public Health, said in a recent phone interview. 
Ryan, who also directs the school’s Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research, said the study looked at both the impact of the hospital price growth cap on insurance premiums and on costs to employers and workers,
The hospital growth cap is part of the state’s affordability standards, which are set and overseen by the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC). Using part of the statutory authority it was granted by the General Assembly, OHIC led a Health Insurance Advisory Council in 2009 that in turn authorized the 2010 creation of the regulatory package known as the affordability standards.

OHIC released its own annual health care spending report last Monday, and found soaring prices for hospitals in 2023 and a widening price gap between treatments delivered to hospital outpatients and those offered in other settings like standalone clinics.
In an interview ahead of the OHIC report’s release, Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King acknowledged the Health Affairs study and called the findings “significant,” as they underscore that even amid increased inflation and demand for medical services, the state still has “some levers in place to mitigate spending growth or cost growth” when it comes to hospitals.
Alas, not all consumers and companies have saved money under the 2010 affordability initiative, as not all health plans are made equal. The study found only “a modest impact on overall commercial premiums” because of differences in employee health insurance.
Employers generally offer two kinds of health plans. Rhode Island’s affordability standards only apply to fully insured plans, in which employers pay a fixed premium to an insurer and the insurer assumes the financial risk. This type of plan, Ryan said, might be chosen by smaller companies who “could go bankrupt if they have an employee that has a huge medical expense.” 
But larger companies are more likely to possess the capital to pay claims outright. That’s why big companies may opt to offer their employees self-insured plans, in which the company pays health claims directly, and contracts with insurance companies only to manage plan benefits. In this arrangement, insurers serve as third-party administrators who are paid fees to manage benefits and process claims. 
“The standards worked as intended in a fully insured market…but we didn’t really see that dynamic happen in the self-funded market,” Ryan said.
The study authors observed price reductions in the self-insured market.“There was kind of a spillover of the policy,” Ryan said. “Hospital prices fell in lockstep in the fully insured market.” 
But, he added, “When we looked at the effects on insurance premiums, we saw only a reduction in the fully insured market, not in the self-funded market.”
Before the affordability standards were enacted, there were on average 295,883 Rhode Islanders in fully insured plans. After the standards, the average dropped to 189,500 members. Today, OHIC data shows that self-insured plans account for about 60% of employee health plans statewide.
Self-insured plans are largely shielded from state intervention by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which established national rules so self-insured plans can operate under the same standards nationwide — a plus for companies which do business across state lines.
“For a company like Home Depot that has stores all over the country, that’s going to be self-funded, but there won’t be a Rhode Island premium equivalent,” Ryan said. “There’s like a national premium equivalent. Even if their own employees are spending less in Rhode Island, that reduction in spending is kind of being spread across their entire set of employees.”
ERISA rules preempt states from mandating more rigorous reporting or price controls, leaving local regulators in an awkward position — and largely in the dark, too — since data on what employers or contracted insurers do with possible hospital savings is limited, Ryan said.
“You hear employers really struggling to get reliable information from their third-party administrators about just basic things, about the prices that different providers are charging,” Ryan said.
Out-of-pocket spending decreased for both fully-funded and self-insured plans, for example — by about $2.9 million and $5.3 million annually, respectively— but it was hard to surmise exactly how those savings materialized. 
The study had to rely on estimations of self-funded costs, Ryan said, because self-insured plans don’t have to submit detailed spending data to state regulators like OHIC.
“Part of the issue here is these ERISA standards that basically make this segment almost totally unregulated,” Ryan said. “I think that this is, frankly, in need of revision, so that the whole number of stakeholders can have greater insight into what’s happening in that self-funded market.”
Hospitals take a hit
More obvious was the financial hit hospitals suffered. The researchers estimated that Rhode Island hospitals lost a combined $158.3 million in commercial revenue per year since the affordability standards were introduced — outpacing the $87.7 million in annual savings enjoyed by fully insured employers and their employees.
“When you reduce prices, you’re taking revenue from hospitals. It’s a simple calculation,” Ryan said. “If there’s a drop-off in clinical care or important operational capacity, then we worry about the impact of this kind of revenue loss. I think it’s still an open question, what kind of impact does this have on quality and operations.”
Since the OHIC standards debuted, Ryan and his team found that Rhode Island hospital operating margins averaged −0.4% by 2021, compared to a national average of 4.8%.
Reduced revenue’s effects on hospital services or access was not within the study’s scope, nor could the study determine if the pricing caps were too high or the hospital margins too low. 
“Whether Rhode Island hospitals’ margins are ‘too low’ can be determined only with more detailed financial information that was not available in our study,” the authors note. “Nonetheless, hospital price growth caps under the standards may need to be periodically recalibrated to avoid undue financial strain for hospitals.”
Ryan said people tend to think hospitals charge excessive prices.
“It doesn’t mean that all hospitals are doing great, and that some massive revenue losses can all be handled equally by hospitals,” Ryan said. “That’s certainly not the case.”
Howard Dulude, interim president of the Hospital Association of Rhode Island, said in an email Friday that the association has not yet reviewed the Health Affairs report in full but offered a succinct take on the affordability standards.. 
“Rhode Island’s affordability standards have, over time, contributed to Rhode Island’s growing health care crisis,” Dulude wrote.
Dulude pointed to two pieces of legislation in the House and Senate’s Health Care Action Package that he called “an important first step in addressing this challenge and beginning to stabilize a system under increasing strain.”
Bill H5832 would expand OHIC’s authority to review and approve hospital contract rates with insurers, especially if annual increases exceed the Consumer Price Index plus 3%. It was heard before the House’s Health and Human Services Committee on April 1 and held for further study.  
Senate resolution S0873 would appropriate $90 million from the state’s general fund to raise Medicaid reimbursement rates for physicians and advanced practice providers. The resolution was introduced and referred to the Senate Committee on Finance on March 21. It is not directly related to OHIC or the affordability standards.

(Courtesy photo by Gary Mataronas Jr.)A bright red buoy near the entrance to Sakonnet Harbor has long served as a waypoint for lobsterman Gary Mataronas when sailing back to Little Compton on foggy days.
“It’s a tremendous aid to navigation,” Mataronas, a Little Compton town councilor, said in an interview. 

The U.S. Coast Guard will accept written comments on the proposed buoy removals through June 13, 2025. The proposed changes can be seen at www.bit.ly/D1Buoy. Comments can be sent via email to D01-SMB-DPWPublicComments@uscg.mil.

Which is why he and other Rhode Island mariners are concerned over a proposal from the U.S. Coast Guard to remove more than three dozen navigational buoys from the state’s waterways, including the Sakonnet River buoy.
“It’s actually a safety risk if they take that out,” Mataronas said. “A lot of these buoys put along the coastline were put there for a reason.”
The Coast Guard is seeking public comment on the proposal to discontinue 350 buoys in the waters between New York and Maine in an effort to modernize the navigation aids — most of which were deployed before modern GPS systems. That includes 38 buoys in the waters from Westerly to Sakonnet Point.
Rhode Island is home to roughly 400 buoys maintained by the Coast Guard.
Proposed buoy changes are intended to “support the navigational needs of the 21st century,” deliver efficient and economical service to manage vessel transit at an acceptable level of risk, according to the Coast Guard’s announcement.
“We recognize that discontinuation of buoys rightfully raises concerns from a variety of waterway users and thus we are also committed to enabling mariner input in the process,” Petty Officer 3rd Class Rajesh Harrilal, a Coast Guard spokesperson, said in an email to Rhode Island Current. “In fact, it is required.”
U.S. Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) has similarly encouraged all commercial and recreational boaters and harbormasters to write to the Coast Guard by its mid-June deadline for public comment. 
“The Coast Guard’s goal should be to ensure safety through an effective, efficient, and resilient navigation system,” Reed said in a statement. “Rhode Islanders know these waters best, and their views should guide Coast Guard decision-making.”
Sail Newport Executive Director Brad Read wrote to the Coast Guard May 8 that buoys placed in Narragansett Bay are “crucial for safe maritime operations in the region.”
“Without these visual aids to navigation, there will be loss of property, there will be environmental damage from groundings, there will be personal injuries, and there will potentially be fatalities from taking out some of these very important beacons,” Read said in an interview.
He likened the Coast Guard’s buoy elimination proposal to taking exit signs off highways.
Most modern boats are equipped with electronic navigation and GPS, but a significant number of vessels in Narragansett Bay still lack that technology, Read said. That includes the 180-boat fleet at the Newport-based sailing education center.
“We want their heads out of the boat looking for those aids to navigation, looking for traffic that’s coming, making good decisions based on what they see with their eyes, not what they see on a screen,” Read said.
North Kingstown Harbormaster James Broccoli told Rhode Island Current that his office is still looking into the Coast Guard’s proposal, but is firmly against the removal of a buoy off Wickford Cove.
“When you’re approaching Wickford Cove, there’s a lot of lights in front of you from land,” he said. “That bell is really a good marker.”
In Little Compton, Mataronas said the Sakonnet River buoy also helps guide students learning to sail at the Sakonnet Yacht Club. Mataronas said removing the marker could lead boats into fish traps set up along the coastline between the breakwater and the beach during the summer.
“If you get over one of those, it can net your propeller and stop you dead in your tracks,” he said.

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)In the 30 days after several damaging twisters hit Arkansas on March 14, the state saw nearly four times as many tornado warnings as Texas did.
The National Weather Service issued 144 warnings in Arkansas, compared to 39 in Texas from March 14 to April 14. Mississippi also recorded 144 warnings over the same period and Tennessee saw 125 warnings. Alabama noted 57 warnings.
It’s an indication that the classic “Tornado Alley” region — the area from central Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, so named because of the number of tornadoes there — is shifting eastward.
The shift is attributed to climate change, the warming of the Gulf of Mexico’s waters and a dip in the cold jet stream pattern.
Arkansas, scientists say, is nearly in the bull’s eye of a new tornado-prone area that’s referred to as “Dixie Alley.”  The region, which has seen a vast increase in tornadoes over the past several years, also encompasses Mississippi, Alabama and western Tennessee.
Weather Service survey teams have already confirmed 35 tornadoes have touched down in Arkansas through April. The state averages 42 twisters per year.
The storms have also been larger.  Arkansas was hit with two EF-4 twisters on March 14 — one in Jackson County and one in Izard County
The last time a tornado of that strength hit the state was on April 27, 2014, when a tornado cut a 41-mile path of destruction through western Pulaski County, Mayflower and Vilonia in Faulkner County, and on into White County. Sixteen people died in that storm.
Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, conducted research about the shift, authoring a paper in 2018 that noted the change. Since then, he’s continued to monitor the trend and says the trend is ongoing.
“It’s still more prevalent in the southeast,” he said. “And we’re seeing more evidence of that each year.”
 ‘Drying up’

Gensini tracked tornado reports from 1979 to 2018 for his initial study, but also noted atmospheric conditions in the areas at the time that were favorable for the formation of tornadoes.
Gensini blames a combination of weather phenomenon for the increase in Arkansas’ tornadoes. A drought in the southwest is taking away needed moisture for the formation of twisters in the traditional Tornado Alley region.
More than 67% of Arizona is experiencing “extreme” and “exceptional” drought conditions — the two highest levels of drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. The Drought Monitor is based at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln and records weather conditions and patterns weekly.
Three months ago, only 17% of Arizona was under the same two drought conditions. A year ago, the state was considered free from extreme and exceptional drought.
New Mexico, Texas and Utah have also seen increases in drought in their respective states. Thirty percent of Texas is in “extreme” and “exceptional” drought, an increase from 14% three months ago.
“The most intense levels of drought now cover a broad area from southeastern California, southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah through much of Arizona, New Mexico and the Texas Big Bend, said Richard Tinker, a meteorologist with the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, and the author of the latest drought report.
“The southern Great Plains are drying up,” Gensini added.
 Faster rate of change

The dry atmospheric conditions in the southwest create a dome of high pressure over the western U.S., sapping energy from the atmosphere and forcing potential tornado-producing systems to move further east. The jet stream, a strong current of frigid Arctic air, is also dipping further south into the Mississippi delta region because of the Southwestern drought.
Water temperature in the Gulf has also increased on average by one or two degrees, creating the moist, humid air needed for tornadoes.
“One or two degrees may not seem much. But think of the difference between 32 degrees and 33 degrees,” Gensini said, referring to the temperature when water freezes. “It’s early in the season, and the waters are warmer. That warm, humid air is heading into Arkansas where the air has been unstable already. It makes things more potent.
“We’re seeing weather pattern changes over the last 70 to 80 years that didn’t happen in 100,000 to 120,000 years before,” he said. “There is such a rapid rate of change, and it’s not lessening.”
Of the 144 warnings issued in Arkansas between March 14 and April 14, not all produced tornadoes, said Dennis Cavanaugh, the National Weather Service warning coordinator in North Little Rock.
In fact, the Weather Service strives to keep its “false alarm” rate of tornado warnings to less than 80%. Warnings are issued when Doppler weather radar picks up rotation in clouds, signature “inflow notches” that indicate the building of cyclonic air patterns, hail cores and other indicators.
The Weather Service also must balance the need to warn people while also not unnecessarily alarming them. Issue too many warnings that don’t produce tornadoes, and the public may become complacent and not heed future warnings as seriously.  John Robinson, a former Meteorologist in Charge at the North Little Rock station, used to say that more people were injured in tornadoes while gawking at clouds for confirmation of those tornadoes rather than seeking shelter when warnings were issued.
On the other side, if the Weather Service curtails its warnings and an unwarned tornado does form, results could be devastating.
“Radar can’t see tornadoes,” Cavanaugh said. “It can see circulation aloft when it’s likely a tornado is forming. If we wait to see the debris cloud from a tornado that’s on the ground to issue a warning, it’s much too late.”

 More hail

Cavanaugh said continued advances in technology should help the Weather Service lower its rate of false alarms. But the service will always rely on trained storm spotters who can see the lowering of wall clouds — a first step in the formation of tornadoes — and any circulation of clouds overhead.
“That’s really not applicable to this year,” he said of the fear that the scores of warnings issued may eventually be ignored. “I don’t think the average Arkansan thought he or she was not warned unnecessarily.”
During a round of storms one April evening, Ryan Vaughn, the meteorologist for KAIT8 in Jonesboro, was broadcasting live storm coverage. At one point, most of northeast Arkansas was placed under a myriad of tornado warnings.
Vaughn took a deep sigh on air.
“I don’t think I’ve ever said this before, but if you’re anywhere in northeast Arkansas, take cover now,” he told viewers.
Tornadoes are formed by opposing winds at various levels. Strong winds in opposite directions cause a shear and a horizontal column of air circulating overhead. Warm, humid air feeds the twister and eventually the column of air begins tilting vertically and lowering to become a destructive tornado.
And if the increase in tornadoes in Arkansas and the Delta is not enough, Gensini said the ingredients for twister formation should also cause larger hail storms.
Hail is formed inside supercell thunderstorms. The rising air inside a building storm lofts raindrops into freezing air. It causes hail, which falls to the ground. Many times, a frozen raindrop falls in the size of a pea or gravel. But with more convection inside the stronger storms, that pea-sized bit of hail is lofted over and over again inside the system, growing larger as more water freezes on it.
That’s what causes the golf ball- and baseball-sized hail and are indicative of stronger storms and tornadoes.
Gensini is about to embark on a 40-day field study this summer of hail storms.
“Tornadoes get all the attention on the news because of the visual destruction,” he said. “You see a path of destruction with shattered homes. But hail is much worse overall.  It damages roofs, cars and agriculture in a much larger area.
“I think the south and southeast will see a lot more problems in the years coming,” he said.

(Bob Wick/BLM/Public Domain Mark 1.0)As an ecologist and someone who grew up hiking Colorado’s foothills and enjoying its alpine streams, I’ve seen firsthand how our relationship with the land shapes who we are — and what we stand to lose. These landscapes aren’t just backdrops for recreation. They’re places of memory, meaning and sustenance.
And they’re at risk.
In May 2021, the Biden-Harris administration outlined a hopeful, ambitious vision: conserve 30% of the nation’s lands and waters by 2030. Known as “30×30” or the America the Beautiful initiative, the goal was clear — work locally and voluntarily to conserve and restore the lands, waters and wildlife that support and sustain the country.
But when the Trump administration rescinded this federal directive, the coordinated momentum was lost. Now, it’s up to states like Colorado to carry this vision forward.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The 30×30 initiative goes far beyond drawing boundaries on a map. It’s about supporting Tribally-led restoration efforts that honor generations of stewardship. It’s about rewarding ranchers, farmers and forest owners who protect soil, water and biodiversity. It’s about investing in restoration and resilience projects that create jobs, buffer us from wildfire and drought, and strengthen our climate future. And it’s about ensuring every community — especially those historically excluded from public lands access — has nearby green spaces to connect with nature.
As someone who’s spent the past decade studying ecosystems and the species that depend on them, I can tell you: The stakes are real. Wildlife corridors are shrinking. Watersheds are drying. Pollinators and other keystone species are in decline. These aren’t distant problems. They’re happening right here, and they’re impacting the places we call home.
When I think about the future of conservation in Colorado, I think about the families I’ve met while working on ecological projects — the ranchers eager to pass healthy land on to their kids and the scientists and volunteers planting native species along fire-scarred slopes. These people aren’t waiting for action. They’re already doing the work. Now, we need policy to meet them there.
America the Beautiful has earned the support of Tribal leaders, organizations, and local officials across the country. But to make meaningful progress, we need state-level action that reflects those same values.
Fortunately, Colorado has a strong foundation. Programs and coalitions like Keep It Colorado, Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s Regional Partnerships Initiative, and the state’s Gross Conservation Easement tax credit program are already connecting the dots between conservation and community. But we can — and must — go further.
Let’s build on that momentum. Let’s invest in nature-based climate solutions. Let’s strengthen partnerships with Tribes, landowners and local governments. Let’s expand access to outdoor spaces and ensure the benefits of conservation flow to every Coloradan. And let’s commit — clearly and publicly — to protecting at least 30% of our state’s lands and waters by 2030.
Our future depends on how we treat the natural world today. The choices we make now will shape the rivers our children fish in, the mountains they hike, and the air they breathe. Colorado has a chance to lead. Let’s not miss it.

The first Trump administration paid out $23 billion in relief to farmers who suffered a loss of trade because of high tariffs. Most of the North Dakota soybean crop has traditionally been shipped to China, the focal point of ongoing trade negotiations. 
According to the North Dakota Soybean Council, 90% of the state’s soybean production leaves North Dakota, with about two-thirds shipped to China and countries in Southeast Asia.
Soybean crushing plants create new marketing opportunities for farmers

But in recent years, two soybean crushing plants have opened in North Dakota, capable of crushing about half the soybeans grown in the state. 
“That’s huge for us, because now we’re not so dependent on China,” Thompson said. 
The Green Bison plant at Spiritwood and the North Dakota Soybean Processors near Casselton produce soybean oil for renewable fuels, soymeal for livestock feed and other products.
Thompson, who farms about 50 miles northwest of Fargo, has sold soybeans to the Casselton plant that opened in 2024.
Without the crush plants, “I’d have to think that our local cash price would be suffering quite a bit more than what it is,” Thompson said. 
The soybean market has been affected by the tariff policies, said Alan Poock, of the American Soybean Association. 
“With all the tariffs and everything going on, the prices have dropped,” Poock said of the soybean market. 
Poock is the director of the Asia Division for the World Initiative for Soy in Human Health. He was in Fargo this month as part of a soybean trade team hosting representatives from Cambodia and Kazakhstan. 
He emphasized the quality of the soybean grown in the Upper Midwest for livestock feed. 
The higher quality, specifically soybeans higher in amino acids, can mean better quality hogs or fish that are fed the soybean meal, Poock said. 
“I tell them, ‘Don’t look at the initial sticker cost … Look at your end result,’” Poock said.

Thompson said the trade teams are key to developing alternatives to China. 
“You can’t just replace that customer with a couple customers here and there. You need to expand your footprint into many different areas,” Thompson said. 
Exporting to small markets comes with some challenges. Poock notes that Kazakhstan is land-locked, so the soybean products will have to go by rail through other countries. Cambodia has ports, but not with the same size and capability of Chinese ports that can take huge shiploads of whole beans.  
Poock said Cambodia prefers soybeans to come in a container like those seen on railcars and cargo ships. 
The availability of containers and the cost of shipping could be a concern if the trade war drags on, he added 
“Right now, things are looking OK, but it seems like every day there’s a new announcement on tariffs or what is going on (with trade),” Poock said. “No one knows what’s going to happen.” 
The United States and China last week announced an agreement to temporarily slash the tariffs that had built up in recent weeks as negotiations continue. 
The China tariff effect has been delayed somewhat because the U.S. usually sells and ships soybeans to China later in the year. 
Nancy Johnson, executive director of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association, said this is the time of year when China is buying soybeans from South America, which is finishing up its growing season.  
The U.S. and China negotiated what is known as the Phase 1 agreement for soybean trade under the first Trump administration, which is still in place. 
While North Dakota has the shortest route of a major soybean growing state to ports on the Pacific, China tariffs are an issue for soybean growers nationwide. 
In the most recent marketing year, U.S. exporters shipped 46.1 million metric tons of soybeans to foreign markets, accounting for over $24 billion in sales. Of those exports, nearly 25 million tons of soybeans went to China — 54% of U.S. soybean exports. 
Those China exports total $13 billion in value, according to the American Soybean Association.
Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky farmer who is the American Soybean Association president, said in a post on the organization’s website after last week’s trade truce announcement that the 90-day pause on the increased tariffs will end in August — right before the U.S. harvest season. 
“We need the administration to continue its negotiations with China to find a long-term, sustainable solution that removes retaliatory tariffs and protects market access for our agricultural products,” Ragland said.

Josh Stein signed the Disaster Recovery Act of 2025 (Part 1) into law. (Photo via the Governor's Press Office)Under the Trump administration, the future of the U.S. disaster management agency is far from certain.
The White House has established a council to study the future of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The president has on multiple occasions said he would like to see it abolished altogether. And when the interim head of the agency told Congress earlier this month that he did not want to see it eliminated, he was swiftly ousted.
North Carolina’s Gov. Josh Stein has made it clear he’d like to see changes to FEMA, too. On Friday, he put those thoughts in a formal letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — outlining a series of recommendations as western North Carolina continues to recover from Hurricane Helene.
“There is no doubt that FEMA could be better and faster,” Stein wrote. “But let us improve it, not abolish it. As governor of a state vulnerable to hurricanes, flooding and other extreme weather, I know we cannot afford for FEMA to be eliminated.”
Among Stein’s suggestions: create a block grant program to let the agency get money out the door quickly and easily. States could submit pre-approved plans ahead of disasters in order to track spending.
And he wants FEMA money to immediately be able to go toward permanent repairs. In almost all cases, aid from the agency can only be used for temporary or pre-storm condition repairs.
As previously reported by NC Newsline, Stein’s administration asked FEMA earlier this year for money to build permanent housing. It was rejected, with a FEMA official citing the fact that “alternative housing options in North Carolina exist.”
The governor also recommended that the agency move away from reimbursement programs. FEMA’s current model forces “cash-strapped local governments to put up funding” for projects, Stein wrote, slowing recovery and often leaving those governments in financial straits.
And he recommended that the agency make it easier for individuals and households to apply for aid. FEMA should consider a “common application” that allows a person to more easily apply to aid across multiple programs and departments, he wrote.
As it rebuilds from the deadliest storm in state history, North Carolina has at times found itself at odds with FEMA under the new administration. The agency denied a request to extend full reimbursement on debris cleanup earlier this year; the state has appealed that decision.
Stein is not the first North Carolina official to recommend fixes for FEMA. U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, a Republican who represents the region hardest hit by Helene, has sent a list of proposals of his own. But Edwards later cancelled a planned press conference after the White House said it needed more time to review his recommendations, the Asheville Citizen Times reported.
Among Edwards’ recommendations: forgiving loans to families and small businesses, loosening building codes and reimbursement for property owners and the state.
And last week, more than 80 lawmakers from both parties — including Edwards and North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis — signed a letter calling on FEMA to begin spending money already approved by Congress for the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. As with Stein, the letter called for improved programming from the agency.
While the program “has room for improvement,” the lawmakers wrote, FEMA and Congress should work together “to improve the application review and funding distribution process to more effectively reduce the costs disasters pose to our communities, economies, and livelihoods.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/unnamed11-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-19 05:59:10.259497

(Photo by Rise To It Productions, Courtesy of Children’s Friend)I am a nurse in the First Connections program at Children’s Friend. I recently spoke at Home Visiting Day at the Rhode Island State House and joined Rep. Joshua Giraldo, a Central Falls Democrat, on the floor of the House for the reading of a resolution commemorating May 8 as Home Visiting Day. Home visiting programs are designed to support families during the crucial early days and years of a child’s life. Nurses like me, along with social workers and family support specialists, bring our expertise directly into a client’s home — making home visiting one of the most accessible forms of support available to new parents. 
Unfortunately, most new parents don’t even know this kind of help exists. 
Last year, the Rhode Island Legislature included updated rates for First Connections in the fiscal year 2025 budget, which effectively saved the program. I am incredibly grateful for this investment. However, significant challenges remain. 
Uncertainty at the federal level, combined with Rhode Island’s shift to a new fee-for-service Medicaid model, continues to strain our ability to deliver services. That’s why passing the RI Home Visiting Act (H6073/S677) is more critical than ever. This legislation would require the state to invest enough to qualify for the maximum federal match. The federal government contributes $3 for every $1 contributed by the state. If the state allocates $356,000 for family home visiting in the fiscal year 2026 budget, that would generate $1.1 million in federal funding. Right now, Rhode Island is one of just three states leaving that money on the table. The other two states are North Dakota and Tennessee.
I believe the lack of investment is simply a lack of awareness. More people need to understand just how vital these programs are. First Connections provides peace of mind and essential support to new parents across the socioeconomic spectrum. This includes addressing the mental and physical health needs of postpartum mothers. 
Through First Connections, I’ve visited families who needed help with the basics: safe sleep, breastfeeding, diapering. I’ve also walked into homes where mothers or babies were in acute medical crisis: dangerously high blood pressure, infant dehydration, undiagnosed postpartum mood disorders, infected C-section incisions. In those cases, serious illness — or even death — could have been the outcome. But it wasn’t, because First Connections was there. Being able to guide and intervene at such a critical moment in a family’s life is deeply fulfilling.  










I believe the lack of investment is simply a lack of awareness. More people need to understand just how vital these programs are.


First Connections is a short-term program, which covers up to three visits. It’s crisis management and an essential connection to longer-term resources for many families. At Children’s Friend, nearly 40% of the families we serve through First Connections are referred to longer-term home visiting programs, like Healthy Families America and Early Head Start. In some cases, we also refer older siblings for Early Intervention services after observing developmental challenges in their home environment.  
Take Maryam’s story for example: 
We visited Maryam and her family just days after she gave birth to her son, Eli. Our priority was making sure both mom and baby were safe and healthy. For Maryam, that meant helping her get to a doctor to refill a critical medication for a pre-existing condition. For Eli, we secured a pediatrician and helped resolve a health insurance issue caused by an error on his birth certificate. We also made sure the older children were safe by installing locks and screens on windows and doors. 
Without First Connections, Maryam’s health and Eli’s development could have been seriously at risk. For Maryam and Eli, three visits weren’t enough, so we connected the family with Early Head Start, a longer-term home visiting program at Children’s Friend. Now, the entire family receives ongoing education and support alongside other families with young children. 
According to a report by the Department of Health, we are only reaching a quarter of the most vulnerable children in our state through home visiting programs. My hope is that awareness will improve participation in these life-changing programs.  
I consider nursing my life’s calling. Through home visiting, I’m not only helping to ensure the immediate health of moms and babies, but I’m working to build stronger, healthier futures for entire families.

Pictured from left are Pria Dua, Charles Alexander, Bett Kilby and Elizabeth Kidd. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A state historical marker titled “Resilience Amid Resistance” now stands on the Western District U.S. Courthouse grounds in Harrisonburg, where a Virginia judge twice upheld the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to desegregate schools in America, allowing local Black students to attend white schools and access an equal education.
Betty Kilby was the lead plaintiff in one of the Virginia cases stemming from localities’ failure to comply with the high court’s Brown v. Board of Education ruling, part of the state’s Massive Resistance policy to buck desegregation, history referenced in the marker unveiled on Saturday. At the unveiling ceremony, Kilby said that when her father James Wilson lost his land and lived an enslaved lifestyle, he vowed his children would have a better life and fought in court to get them an education equal in quality to that of the white children in Warren County, where the family lived. 

A judge ruled in the family’s favor, ordering Kilby’s local high school to be integrated, according to a personal narrative Kilby shared with the American Psychological Association. Although the state then closed the school for six months to delay Black and white pupils learning together, the Virginia Supreme Court dismantled Massive Resistance in January 1959 and the school reopened, with Kilby and 22 other Black students attending at first by themselves and then alongside white students. 
Attending the desegregated school from 8th grade to her senior year was traumatic and intimidating, Kilby recalled at the event, saying she had been called names and was attacked by white students.
“It was pretty consistent all five years, and it got worse in my senior year because my whole attitude changed,” said Kilby. “I didn’t care whether I lived or died.”
The marker’s unveiling in the city of Harrisonburg fell on the anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision that declared segregation in public schools unconstitutional. The emblem of Virginia’s fraught educational history was the brainchild of two then-high school students, as part of the Farmville Tour Guides Project. The project’s goal is to connect modern-day students with the stories of students who lived through the turbulent Civil Rights Era and paved the way for generations of integrated education.
“We wanted to keep going solely for the reason of continuing to be able to share their story,” said Pria Dua, a Rockingham County Public Schools graduate, adding that she and her collaborators wanted to make the monumental court desegregation decisions a permanent symbol.
Elizabeth Kidd, a Rockingham County graduate who worked with Dua, said the two met many “incredible people” during the research process. She said it was only fitting to support telling their stories.
“A lot of them, still today, are still trying to get their story out there, or make known this history that happened and I think the marker was kind of just like sitting there for us as a way for us to keep working,” Kidd said. 
 Marker illuminates Black Virginians’ struggle for equal education

Although it was a lengthy process, Kidd and Dua said one of the keys to installing the marker was the support they received — from the community, lawmakers including U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and U.S. Rep. Ben Cline, R-Botetourt, and the Virginia Board of Historic Resources, which approved the manufacture and installation of the historical marker last September.
Virginia has more than 2,600 state markers, which are primarily maintained by the Virginia Department of Transportation, according to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, except in those localities outside of VDOT’s authority.
Rocktown History, a museum, archive and genealogy library, covered the unspecified costs of the marker. According to the Department of Historic Resources, the cost to create a marker is approximately $3,000. For localities outside of VDOT’s jurisdiction, there is a $415 charge for the post.
The students worked with Harrisonburg City Council, judges at the federal court, Virginia Board of Education member and former Virginia Secretary of Education Anne Holton and Kaine to obtain approval for the marker to be placed on federal property.
The Farmville Tour Guides Project, the student-led independent study that has operated for over a year and one of the driving forces behind the new marker, allows students to explore Virginia’s Civil Rights history through accounts of figures like Barbara Johns. In 1951, Johns led a student strike at R.R. Moton High School in Prince Edward County in protest of the unequal conditions of her segregated school. The protest, along with lawsuits by the NAACP, were crucial to the success of the Brown v. Board of Education case.

Joan Johns Cobbs, a Moton student striker, plaintiff in the Brown v. Board case and the sister of the late Barbara Johns, was one of several guests at Saturday’s ceremony. 
Other guests included Charles Alexander, the youngest plaintiff in the Allen v. Charlottesville case, in which federal judge John Paul Jr. issued the first school desegregation order in the commonwealth to favor the NAACP against Charlottesville City Public Schools. Alexander is a member of the “Charlottesville 12,” named for the first 12 Black students who attended the city’s all-white public schools in 1959. Ann Rhodes Baltimore, the first Black graduate of a desegregated school in Virginia, was also present.
With cases of Black history being omitted or minimized in school curricula, Alexander told the Mercury before Saturday’s marker unveiling, it’s important to continue passing on such historical stories of segregation and discrimination.
He hopes the public would remember the story of his fellow plaintiffs, similar to that of Ruby Bridges, the first Black child to desegregate an all-white school in the South.
“We just didn’t all of a sudden appear; there were folks that sacrificed, gave up their jobs and made a commitment for this to come about, and so we need to share that,” Alexander said. 
The Farmville Tour Guides Project also stemmed from a desire for students to learn about Black Virginians’ historic struggle for equal educational opportunity. The project was founded in 2015 by Beau Dickenson, supervisor of history studies at Rockingham County Public Schools, and history teacher Owen Longacre at Spotswood High School in Rockingham County.
Dickenson said both educators were surprised to see that the Moton story was not covered in Virginia’s public education curriculum, which spurred them into action.
“We just thought that that was such a tragic shame given the significance of that event,” Dickenson said. “It felt like it had been omitted from history. So we wanted to amplify that story, but we also because of the nature of that story thought this has to be something different than just a field trip. This needs to be something that’s active and engaged.”
Dua and Kidd also worked with three other students on the Knocking Down Walls documentary about school desegregation featured nationally on Good Morning America.

Board of Education case, which ruled that segregation in schools was unconstitutional. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)
Holton, the event’s keynote speaker, said amid the concerns and questions about how students are doing in Virginia’s public schools, students like Dua and Kidd are examples of incredible work pupils in the state are undertaking. Holton is the daughter of former Gov. Linwood Holton, who ended Massive Resistance in Virginia.
“I’m going to be at a Board of Education meeting next week (and) I’m going to tell them that the kids are all right,” Holton said. “ The future is in great hands, and these incredible teachers — this is public education at its best.”
Holton also talked about the courage of the plaintiffs, the attorneys, and judges in desegregation cases. She said judges were threatened and one even had a cross burned in front of their home,  a once-common practice of the white supremacist terror group, the Ku Klux Klan. 
Holton said she hopes judges in Harrisonburg, and nationwide, “will be inspired by this marker every day as they walk past it going into the courthouse and courthouses like it all across the country to that resilience amid resistance that we all need to have that’s so crucial to what makes our country work.” 
Saturday’s unveiling, hosted by Rockingham County Public Schools, Rocktown History, and the City of Harrisonburg, was capped off with students from the Farmville Tour Guides Project presenting a companion exhibition on the fight for school equality across Virginia at the Moton Museum in Farmville, formerly the high school where Johns led the historic student protest. 
Dickenson said the exhibit showcases how students are engaging in civic life and using history to inform action.
Cainan Townsend, executive director for the Moton Museum, said the efforts by area students to apply for the marker, develop a museum exhibit and seek out historical information have been impressive. 
“I think it’s really young people deciding that our history is more than battle sites,” Townsend said. “Our history is more than just these 10, 15 (and) 20 people you think are important. There are important stories from all parts of Virginia, and by increasing the volume and the diversity of these historical markers, I think that’s a great way to show that.”

Photo By Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia MercuryWhen Denodra Bennett stepped into Another Level Barbershop and Cosmetology School in Petersburg on Friday morning for a haircut, she didn’t realize she would also be leaving with a shifted perspective on her health and reminder to set up her next doctor’s appointment. 
The experience stemmed from a partnership between the American Heart Association, Aetna Better Health of Virginia and Capital Area Health Network to raise awareness about hypertension and encourage community members to keep tabs on their blood pressure and heart health. Petersburg, recently dubbed a “Healthy Hearts City,” is making strides to address heart disease and stroke, the leading causes of death in the locality. 
Bennett, a Chesterfield County resident, took advantage of health professionals’ presence at the shop to have her blood pressure checked and was surprised to learn it was slightly elevated. 
It’s never been an issue for her before, she said, but feels like she’s been “slacking” on her diet and fitness lately.  
“I would say ‘don’t assume that your health is where you think it is, you need to actually go and let that professional check you out,’” she said. 
Likewise, Archie Robinson got his levels checked by happenstance when he came in for his haircut Friday. Participants received $5 dollars off their trims at ALBC that day. 










You take care of your car maintenance every three to four months. You have to take care of your body like that, because if you neglect your medical needs, it's gonna eventually break down on you, and we don't want that to happen.


– Capital Area Health Network outreach coordinator Robin Tyler


Wesley Nicholas Jr., who owns the shop with his wife Candace, said that he was excited to coordinate with the health professionals for the event. The couple frequently utilizes their shop for community engagement events with their spirituality a key role, so when CAHN outreach coordinator Robin Tyler approached them about hosting the heart health awareness event, they were all in. 
“Miss Robin and her team are always out in the community doing great things. So she explained to me about awareness of high blood pressure and I said ‘I think  that’s something we can work together on,’” Nicholas explained.  “The awareness that we bring into our community and to our customers are so exciting to help to realize that we can save someone’s life, or they can save their own.”
Nearly half of adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure, which puts them at a higher risk for heart attacks or strokes. Research shows high blood pressure is more prevalent in Black communities, in part from systemic racism’s impact on people’s lives. Examples include historic redlining, which  decades ago determined where many Black people could live and how resources like public transportation, road improvements, and access to healthy foods were invested in their neighborhood. 
For anyone with hypertension, their high blood pressure can be hard to detect without blood pressure checks. The condition can be managed through medication or lifestyle changes, depending on patients’ specific needs. 
Offering health care services outside of a doctor’s office is important, Tyler said, because heart issues associated with high blood pressure can be tricky to detect without regular checkups. 
“You take care of your car maintenance every three to four months. You have to take care of your body like that, because if you neglect your medical needs, it’s gonna eventually break down on you, and we don’t want that to happen,” she said. 
By addressing preventable or manageable health issues like high blood pressure, Tyler hopes to avert people from needing to accrue costly emergency room visits down the line. It’s an especially needed service: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control identified parts of Petersburg as having the highest rate of hypertension in Virginia, the Progress-Index reported. 
In her role with the federally qualified health center, Tyler regularly engages Petersburg-area residents to connect them to the CAHN clinics or their own health care providers. 
Likewise, it’s Angela Taylor’s job as senior community impact director with the American Heart Association to coordinate with local organizations on initiatives like the heart health awareness campaigns taking place in area barber shops and beauty salons. 
It’s one facet of helping to break down barriers to accessing health care, she said. Sometimes emotional reservations keep people from making doctor’s visits, and transportation or financial access issues can also be a challenge. Local communal hubs like the Nicholas’ barbershop can be an entry point for people to seek further assistance, be reminded to keep up regular physician visits and gain tips to improve their heart health.
“Our goal with doing these community blood pressure stations is truly to meet people where they are,” Taylor said.

(Charlie Paullin/VirginiaMercury)On May 5, attorneys general from 17 states and the District of Columbia — not including Virginia, regrettably —  sued the Trump administration over its attacks on the wind industry. The lawsuit challenges an executive order, signed by President Donald J. Trump on his first day in office, stopping all approvals, permits and funding for wind projects across the country and offshore. 
Since the order was signed, the administration hasn’t just blocked new projects, it’s issued a stop-work order for one project under construction in New York and revoked a permit for another. The actions inflict enormous damage on the wind industry and on the economies of states that need the energy and jobs this industry could deliver.
One state that will lose big under Trump’s order is Virginia, which has positioned itself to be a national leader in offshore wind deployment, supply chain and manufacturing. On top of that, Virginia badly needs the electricity from offshore wind to help meet the demand from data centers; it can’t afford to have a major new source of energy strangled in its infancy. Yet Attorney General Jason Miyares did not join the lawsuit.
Will special rate classes protect Va. residents from the costs of serving data centers?

Sure, Miyares wants to be a good soldier in the Trump putsch. And no doubt he wouldn’t feel at home among all those Democratic AGs (there were no Republicans signing the complaint). But he could at least speak up in his state’s interest. Some well-timed advocacy would go a long way in showing the administration that wind energy is not a partisan matter. 
It doesn’t have to be just our attorney general, either. The silence from Gov. Glen Youngkin has been equally deafening. What are they afraid of? Youngkin can’t run for reelection, and Miyares has already secured his party’s nomination in his bid for reelection this fall.
Youngkin vetoes clean energy bills supported by Dominion, environmental groups

Any politician who styles himself as pro-business ought to be pushing back on the Trump administration’s interference with contracts, destruction of American jobs and infliction of billions of dollars in damage to a growing domestic industry. Especially when it is happening to their own state, the big risk is in not speaking out.
And let’s face it, attacking wind energy is Trump’s own peculiar hobbyhorse, not his party’s. Though Republican support for wind energy has dropped a bit in recent years, it remains above 50%. Onshore wind is the largest source of electricity in Iowa and South Dakota and a major source in several other Republican strongholds. Wind power is responsible for billions of dollars in economic investment while keeping utility rates low in states that rely on it. 
Offshore wind is more expensive, but states have embraced it for its potential to lower electricity bills over time while relieving grid congestion, creating well-paying jobs and providing clean, zero-carbon power to East Coast cities. Thirteen states have established offshore wind development goals, totaling over 112 gigawatts (GW) by 2050. 
In Virginia, Republican leaders have been among the biggest boosters of offshore wind for more than 15 years. Legislators from both parties supported the creation of the Virginia Offshore Wind Development Authority. With a boost from then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, the Virginia Department of Energy partnered with Dominion Energy on a research project that produced the nation’s first offshore wind turbines in federal waters. Republican support also paved the way for Dominion’s development of the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project, now more than halfway to completion and expected to begin delivering electricity next year. 
Nor is CVOW a one-off; the Virginia Clean Economy Act declares twice as much offshore wind power to be “in the public interest.” At the offshore wind International Partnering Forum held in Virginia Beach last month, Dominion displayed a poster of the projects it has in the works. These include a project off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, which Dominion acquired last October, as well as a huge lease area east of CVOW, which Dominion secured in a lease auction from the federal government last August. All told, Dominion’s projects could deliver a total of 9 GW of clean, renewable power. 
As important as the energy itself is, Virginia leaders believe offshore wind can be a driver of economic development and job creation for the Hampton Roads area. The Virginia Economic Development Partnership touts Virginia’s strategic location, strong maritime industry and ready workforce as draws for businesses up and down the offshore wind supply chain.
Some businesses have already set up shop in Virginia to serve the industry. These include most recently a Korean subsea cable manufacturer that is investing almost $700 million for a facility in Chesapeake. Gov. Glen Youngkin was on hand for the groundbreaking last month, calling it “a proud moment for Virginia.” Attracting the company was only possible because of Virginia’s commitment to the wind industry – as well as the availability of federal tax credits that Trump also intends to eliminate. 
CVOW will likely survive Trump’s attacks (albeit at a higher cost due to his tariffs), but Virginia’s ability to develop an offshore wind workforce and supply chain are very much at risk. The Trump administration’s war on wind power already threatens developers with losses in the billions of dollars. With permitting at a halt, companies are headed for the exits instead of creating the project pipeline necessary for offshore wind to become the powerhouse industry that it is in Europe and Asia.
Trump may have planned his economic sabotage to hurt northeastern states with Democratic governors, but the collateral damage to Virginia is considerable. As it is, our economy has taken a hit from Trump’s mass firings of federal workers, thousands of whom live here. We can’t afford to lose four years of offshore wind progress for no better reason than that Trump wills it. 
Silence is not an acceptable response. Miyares and Youngkin must speak up for Virginia.

(Photo by Chip Jackson/Richmond Public Schools)A state grant program called Safe Routes to Schools, which funds crossing guard training, teaches students how to safely ride a bike and sponsors walk and bike to school days, has gone through a metamorphosis that could put the brakes on those initiatives.
Safe Routes to Schools was created in 2005 under the federal Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act but got an influx of funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which was passed in 2021. 
Safe Routes to School funds Fit4Kids, an initiative promoting a healthy lifestyle through nutrition and movement implemented in Central Virginia school districts including in the cities of Richmond, Hopewell and Petersburg, and Chesterfield and Henrico Counties.
“Fit4Kids has been the Safe Routes to School program for the city of Richmond for about 10 years,” said Mary Dunne Stewart, chief executive officer of Greater Richmond Fit4Kids. 
Stewart said in that time, they were able to grow it from a small pilot program, to a district-wide one that trains more than 100 crossing guards and teaches 750 students annually in their Learn to Bike program.

In Harrisonburg, project coordinator Andrea Troyer said though their program has been “on and off” for 10 years, and was originally led by a part-time coordinator. But because of a SRTS grant, they were able to hire her as a full-time coordinator back in November. Since then, she’s been trying to restart the bike program.
“One of the big things that’s been a success, is the education around students in their bike units,” she said. I was coming from a school that had started up their bike unit for the first time in six years. And so it’s really exciting to kind of see the excitement from teachers, administrators, students, (and) from parents.”
A major change to how program facilitators request funding and use it has left them unsure if they’ll be able to grow their outreach efforts in the fiscal years of 2027-28. 
Stewart said in the beginning, the Fit4Kids program was funded in a certain way.
“It used to be funded by a specific line item at VDOT that was for Safe Routes to School with federal funding. And that funding went away about three years ago,” Stewart said.
According to Jessica Cowardin, assistant director of communications for the Virginia Department of Transportation, when federal funding for the SRTS program was eliminated, the activities under the program became eligible under the Transportation Alternatives Program (TAP).
“Because dedicated SRTS funding has not been federally reestablished, all SRTS projects must be administered in accordance with the federal TAP guidance,” Cowardin said in an email to Virginia Mercury. 
Stewart thought the change was “great,” and  said the funding stream still allowed localities to apply for various bike, pedestrian and infrastructure projects. But the issue is in the numbers.
 How Fit4Kids and other programs get grant funding, and the challenges with the process

Normally when requesting funds, programs such as Fit4Kids work in conjunction with city departments. In Richmond, for example, it’s the Department of Public Works. In turn, DPW piggybacks Fit4Kids requests into their bigger pile of funding requests for infrastructure projects.
In the past, localities could request funding for up to 11 projects. But now, that number has dwindled to five. This means projects under TAP have to compete with the larger, more expensive infrastructure projects cities need money for.
The purpose of the change, some local leaders said, remains unclear. 
“We’re trying to figure out, why is this happening? Is this a big picture strategy decision from the governor’s office or from the Secretary of Transportation? Or is this kind of a mid-level decision?” asked Stewart. “The only response we’ve gotten is that they’re trying to incentivize new programs.”
Cowardin of VDOT said they have to administer TAP funding in accordance with federal and state code and in line with policies established by Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB), which were last updated in summer of 2023. She said the change in maximum TAP applications to five per cycle went into effect this year. 
This drastic application reduction spurred major concern for Justine Blincoe, policy director of Richmond’s Fit4Kids. She said her organization has had a great relationship with DPW over years but the cap on grant applications they can submit threatens it.
“Because the city of Richmond is kind of earmarking one of the project submissions for us each year, if they were limited to doing five project submissions versus two times that amount, it would really limit their opportunity to be able to apply for other higher cost projects,” she said. 
Blincoe said if you compare the cost of a big paving project to how much money Safe Routes to School needs to operate, for example, it’s possible the youth biking programs will be left out. 
“It just really kind of puts into perspective that they could be losing out on opportunities to apply for something that’s higher cost. And it really kind of disincentivizes localities to partner with a Safe Routes to School program to be able to do this,” Blincoe said. 
Because of the uncertainty of being left out of funding, Stewart met with representatives from Richmond Public Schools on May 13.
“I’m meeting with RPS to ask them to be the applicant instead of DPW,” she said to Virginia Mercury in an email ahead of the discussion. “I feel very uneasy asking DPW to forgo a much more expensive project for a VERY low reimbursement rate for SRTS.”
The day after that meeting, Stewart said RPS agreed to be the lead applicant in future applications.

Everyone knows the state legislature must operate under a set of parliamentary rules and procedures. After all, maintaining order in a large group of opinionated and talkative politicians is no easy feat.
That said, when the rules become so numerous, complex and restrictive that they make majority rule effectively impossible, they’ve gone too far and right now, that’s the case in the North Carolina House of Representatives.
Last week, House leaders rolled out their new state budget proposal in a series of appropriations subcommittees and, at least in theory, opened it up to debate and amendment.
Unfortunately, there was catch: a long list of restrictive rules that barred even the consideration of most meaningful amendments.
For example, no amendment to spend additional dollars was allowed unless it reduced another line item from a very restricted list by the same amount – even if a majority of lawmakers wanted to do so.
The bottom line: In representative government, the majority is supposed to rule. In the North Carolina House a list of anti-democratic restrictions make sure that’s not the case.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)As Ohioans pleaded for more support for the state’s public libraries, there was also outcry against a provision that library staff and supporters say would add more work and unnecessary regulations to the local institutions.
The Ohio House added a provision to their budget draft that was not in the governor’s executive proposal, one that would require public libraries to place “material related to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression in a portion of the library that is not primarily open to the view of minors.”
As budget plans move through the Ohio Senate, state residents asked the chamber to push back on the House’s proposal and eliminate the provision in their own draft.
Librarians who spoke at the Senate Education Committee last week noted the vague language of the provision, and tried to give legislators an idea of the heavy lift this might mean for libraries. Library visitors and advocates criticized the provision as targeted toward LGBTQ+ content, such as transgender issues.
“Books are an outlet, an escape,” said Bree Taylor, founder and executive director of the non-profit transgender advocacy groups Trans Unity Coalition. “A children’s book isn’t going to turn a kid gay or trans, but it will bring comfort to a kid who already is.”
Toledo resident Erin Prestwich said the idea of separating out the content speaks not only to keeping children from accessing content some may find objectionable because of its connection to LGBTQ+ issues, but to simply keeping children from seeing perspectives that match their own.
“I ‘acted like a boy’ as a child, like climbing trees, playing with trucks in the dirt,” Prestwich wrote to the committee. “I am not transgender, and never thought that I was, but I did enjoy reading books as a child (with characters) who did things that I wanted to do. That is normal. It is important for children to read about characters that are like them.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe libraries themselves spoke to the already existing ways in which parents can control a child’s access to certain materials. Library systems have collections and purchasing policies that come with opportunities for public feedback and input, and many libraries have tiered library cards based on the amount of access a parent wants a child to have.
“While libraries do provide access to information, we do not act ‘in loco parentis,’” said Jay Smith, director of government and legal services for the Ohio Library Council. “We do not act in the place of the parent or guardian. Parents and guardians play a vital role in determining what their children are reading and have a right to determine what is best for their child.”
Amelia Green, who identified herself as a married transgender woman who plans to raise children in Ohio, agreed that parents should be the deciding factor in what children have access to, not state leaders.
“This provision is not just misguided – it is a violation of parental rights,” Green told the committee. “As a future parent, it should be my right – not the government’s – to decide how and when I introduce my children to stories about people like their parents, their friends and potentially themselves.”
Green also said the language contained in the state budget proposal would mean taking her children past “actual adult material” just to find “a simple picture book about a kid with two moms, or a young adult novel with a trans protagonist.”
“That’s absurd,” she said. “Queer stories are not adult content – they are human content.”
Funding the provision
As libraries face an uncertain financial future while they wait for the state to decide whether or not to fund the Public Library Fund, the provision to separate out certain content could come with its own financial load.
The House budget draft noted “potential costs” for identifying and relocating the “restricted materials.”
With no additional funds added alongside the proposed changes, library staff said moving books based on their content would be extremely costly in some cases and in other cases nearly impossible, based on the limited space in branch libraries.
Paula Brehm-Heeger, director of the Cincinnati & Hamilton County Public Library, said she recently visited one of the smaller libraries in her system, and could see the entire library as soon as she entered it. Even if separating the materials is possible, the cost at the southwestern Ohio library system would “likely be upwards of $1 million per year, adjusting for inflation and current library procedures,” according to Brehm-Heeger.
Having the provision in place with the vague language as it stands would lead to “inconsistent and arbitrary enforcement across Ohio,” Lauren Hagan, CEO of the Columbus Metropolitan Library, told the committee. Her team could only make an “educated guess” at the financial impact such a policy would have.
“We anticipate the initial cost for compliance at $3.14 million, with continuing costs of approximately $1.7 million every year,” Hagan said.
The Senate is still working on their budget draft, expected to be released in the coming weeks, with a deadline for a final draft combining the House and Senate priorities due by the end of June.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
State wildlife agencies focus on ‘hook and bullet’ work. Some see a new path.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Howard Pearl said, ""We have to sometimes make that tough decision to slow things down just a little bit."" (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)It’s boxy, angular, and typically yellow. And when it lights up on a car dashboard, the next step is often hundreds of dollars in repairs.
But some in New Hampshire believe the “check engine” light is not always reliable, and that its presence can cause vehicles to fail their state inspection even when everything is working fine. 
“That has been weaponized by this (inspection) program,” said Paul Wolf, one of dozens who spoke at a Senate hearing recently. “A hood latch out, or AC refrigerant low would set that light off.”
That sentiment is part of what’s driving an effort to end mandatory annual state vehicle inspections altogether. A bill to do so passed the House in March. 
But on Thursday, the Senate applied the brakes and retained the bill, arguing it needed a little more work. That action would delay passage of the bill until early 2026 at the earliest. But the issue could return in the June negotiations between the House and Senate over passage of the two-year budget.
Some senators were frustrated, citing constituents who feel burdened by the inspection costs.
“We owe it to them to fix this problem,” said Sen. Tim McGough, a Merrimack Republican. “We’ve inspected it and inspected it. It’s time to fix it. The time is now to get it fixed.” As passed by the House, the bill would end New Hampshire’s mandatory state inspection system, in which vehicles must pass inspections in the owner’s birth month and a windshield sticker displays that compliance.
Supporters of the repeal say inspections are costly and unnecessary, and that drivers can safely maintain their cars without them. They have cited reviews and studies that suggest there is no correlation between mandatory inspection laws and lower traffic accidents and fatalities. And they argue the inspection law largely benefits car dealerships and mechanic shops. 
Opponents of the law, who include the New Hampshire State Police and many industry groups, say the inspections help identify vehicle safety issues that could lead to crashes, and that they help the environment by reducing harmful emissions. 
But while the House had pushed for an all-out repeal of the inspections, some Republicans on the Senate Commerce Committee had favored a shift toward requiring the inspections every other year, instead. That disagreement — which included a last-ditch attempt at an amendment — in addition to opposition to the entire idea from Democrats, doomed the bill on Thursday.
“It’s a challenge for us, but when a bill isn’t ready, a bill isn’t ready, and that’s the hard part,” said Sen. Howard Pearl, a Loudon Republican who said he supported the main objectives of the bill. “And … we have to sometimes make that tough decision to slow things down just a little bit.”
In 2023, 1,048,001 million vehicles were registered in New Hampshire, according to the Department of Safety. 
New Hampshire is one of 14 states that require car inspections either every year or every other year. Most of those states are in the Northeast; the list includes Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts.
Those in support of repealing the car inspection requirement have pointed to states that had mandatory inspections and then eliminated them. 
They argue the inspection creates the potential for conflicts of interest, since vehicle repair shops carry out both the inspections and the necessary repairs.
Some advocated for state employees to conduct the inspections, so that the diagnoses are more impartial. 
“Other states do this,” said Wolf. “They hire their own technicians, and all they do is inspect. They don’t do the work. There’s no conflict of interest.”
Supporters of the law have also raised issues with certain diagnostic lights that must be addressed before a car can pass inspection — in particular, the check engine light. Advocates for repealing the inspections say that indicator can often be a false alarm. 
Repealing the inspection would cost the state about $3.4 million of revenue a year, according to the Department of Safety. About 85% of that revenue goes into the Highway Fund, while the rest is split between the motor vehicle air pollution abatement fund and the general fund. 
Of the amount that goes to the highway fund, 12% — or about $346,500 a year — is distributed to cities and towns, according to the department.
But the bill has also created a backlash, with 489 people registering their opposition to the bill over two Senate committee hearings, compared to 129 people supporting it.
Those opposed include the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Environmental Services, the New Hampshire Motorcyclists’ Rights Organization, the New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association, and a number of individual vehicle repair businesses.
“House Bill 649 seeks to shift the responsibility of identifying unsafe vehicles entirely onto law enforcement, placing an undue burden on troopers who are already stretched thin, expecting them to spot mechanical issues during routine patrols without the tools, time, or training of a licensed inspector,” said New Hampshire State Police Captain Matthew Amatucci, speaking in a Senate hearing last month. 
Relying on police to catch problems, Amatucci said, “means that the danger has already reached the road.” 
David Dupont, who founded Dupont’s Service Center in Dover but has since retired, said the inspections catch a number of flaws or broken parts, especially with older vehicles and motorcycles. And he said the indicator lights do serve a purpose. 
“The check engine light is more than just a light,” he said. “It’s telling you that the vehicle is polluting more. It’s telling you that the consumer is not getting optimal fuel economy, and the vehicle emissions most likely are out of compliance. How is that good for New Hampshire?”
Dupont also pushed back against the idea that repair shops are engaging in fraud, noting that there is a legal penalty for fraudulent inspections that can lead to misdemeanor charges. 
“We’re held to a standard, and no one wants to end up in court because they pass a car that didn’t pass inspection,” Dupont said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5153655-Howard-Pearl-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 05:59:10.259497

The Legislature advanced three statewide ballot measures North Dakota voters will consider in 2026. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers passed three ballot measures during the legislative session that will go to voters in 2026.
If passed by a majority of voters, the state could see a new 60% voter threshold for passage of future constitutional changes; a single-subject rule that limits the scope of future ballot petitions; and adjustments to legislative term limits.
 60% constitutional measure threshold

House Resolution 3003, sponsored by Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, would require approval of 60% of voters to pass constitutional ballot measures. The new threshold would apply to both citizen-initiated petitions and constitutional changes advanced by the Legislature.
Sen. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo, said the state’s constitution should have a different standard than the Century Code.

“The constitution should be harder to amend,” said Roers, chair of the Senate State and Local Government Committee, which held hearings on the ballot measure proposals.
Opponents of the resolution argued that bringing a citizen-initiated measure is not easy and the higher threshold undermines voters’ rights.
The ballot measure will be voted on during the November 2026 general election.
 Single-subject rule

Senate Resolution 4007, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, would require the Secretary of State’s Office to deny any citizen-initiated constitutional ballot petition that is “comprised of more than one subject.”
The single-subject rule would also apply to future constitutional amendments proposed by the Legislature. 
Mary Tintes, vice president of the League of Women Voters of North Dakota, said the organization does not support the ballot measure and has concerns that the language is ambiguous, leaving it open to interpretation.
“We’re just afraid that it’s going to be used as a tool against some of the initiated processes that we are using,” Tintes said.
Lawmakers directed that the single-subject rule ballot measure appear on the June 2026 primary election ballot.
Roers said the Legislature chose the primary so the general election ballot wouldn’t be “overloaded” with ballot measures.
Some opponents of the resolution object to it being placed on the ballot of the June primary, an election that typically sees a lower turnout than the general election. 
 Amending legislative term limits

Senate Resolution 4008, sponsored by Sen. Michael Dwyer, R-Bismarck, would amend North Dakota’s term limits law that was approved by voters in 2022. The law limits lawmakers to serve no more than eight years in each legislative chamber.

Under the new resolution, lawmakers would be able to serve for up to 16 years in one chamber. It also clarifies that partial terms, such as being appointed by a district executive committee to fill a vacant seat in the Legislature, would not count toward the term limit total.
The resolution would also repeal Section 4 of the term limit law that prohibits the Legislature from amending, repealing or altering the term limits portion of the law, which has raised concerns about a potential lawsuit over the resolution, if it becomes law.
Roers said members of an opposition group, U.S. Term Limits Foundation, testified against the resolution during the committee process and said it could be challenged in court. 
Tintes said the League of Women Voters has not taken a position on the term limits ballot measure, but she thinks voters may be getting annoyed with addressing the same things over and over again.
“It certainly doesn’t require much of a memory to say, ‘Didn’t we already vote on term limits?’” Tintes said. 
The resolution will be voted on during the November 2026 general election.
Citizen-initiated measures
A sponsoring committee for a separate citizen-initiated ballot measure is gathering signatures that would eliminate window tint requirements for North Dakota vehicles. If the committee gathers and has more than 15,582 signatures verified by the Secretary of State’s Office, the measure would be put to the voters in 2026. The committee must submit its signatures by Feb. 24, 2026.
House Bill 1340, signed by Gov. Kelly Armstrong in March, decreased the amount of light required to pass through front vehicle windows from 50% to 35%.
A group of citizens submitted a petition in February for a ballot measure focused on transparency of lawmaker records, legislative salaries and lobbying. It has not been approved for circulation. Secretary of State Michael Howe said his office is waiting for the committee to resolve some issues with sponsoring committee member affidavits.

Local leaders and community members gathered to celebrate breaking ground on the new development, 4401 Rosa Parks Apartments, which will feature 40 one-bedroom and 20 two-bedroom units, according to a news release from the City of Detroit.
Amongst attendees at the building site was Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, the news release said, who remarked that despite slow population growth in Michigan, Detroit has experienced recent population growth. U.S. Census Bureau data this week reflected that Detroit saw positive population growth in the past year for the second year in a row.
“Breaking ground on this beautiful new affordable housing development on the same day the Census Bureau released data showing that Detroit is leading the state in population growth is so meaningful,” Duggan said. “Adding 60 new units of beautiful affordable housing right here in the Woodbridge District demonstrates how as the city continues to grow, we are working together to make sure Detroiters of all incomes can afford to live well, even in some of the hottest neighborhoods.”
Duggan is running as an independent candidate for governor in 2026.

The housing development is a collaboration between nonprofit real estate developer Cinnaire Solutions and Woodbridge Neighborhood Development, a community-based non-profit dedicated to redeveloping the area as an affordable place to live, the release said. Funding comes from public and private sources, including a grant from the Detroit/Wayne County Port Authority and financing from Independent Bank and the Michigan State Housing Development Authority, or MSHDA.
And part of the project will include building commercial space on the ground-floor of the building, as well as a community room, the release said. There will also be a bike share station, a new playground, green gathering spaces and a corner plaza.
Residents in Woodbridge are invested in making the neighborhood a place not only for families to live, but make a life, Executive Director of Woodbridge Neighborhood Development Jai Singletary said in the news release.
“4401 Rosa Parks is the cornerstone of a resident-led plan to preserve affordability, promote connectivity, and protect the neighborhood’s sense of place,” Singletary said. “Bringing new affordable, accessible apartments with modern amenities reflects our commitment to expanding housing options in Woodbridge.”

House Bill 2, a sprawling budget bill working its way through the New Hampshire Legislature, includes under-the-radar provisions that could gut an important state renewable energy program.






The 183-page bill, already approved by the House, includes measures that would redirect millions of dollars from a state renewable energy fund to the general budget and to rebates for utility customers.


Advocates say the changes would endanger renewable energy development in New Hampshire and do not belong in this bill, which is intended to lay out policy changes needed to implement the state budget.


“Major policy changes do not belong buried in a bill with no chance for significant scrutiny,” said Nick Paul, director of legislative affairs for nonprofit advocacy group Clean Energy New Hampshire. ​“It’s undemocratic, and it’s irresponsible.”


Supporters of the measures, however, say they are sensible approaches to saving consumers money at a time when energy bills have been soaring.


“You can’t keep piling costs on the backs of ratepayers indefinitely because eventually they’re going to rebel,” said Rep. Michael Vose, a Republican and the chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee. ​“We’re not against clean energy at all, but we are for cost savings and efficiency.”


The provisions in question relate to the state’s Renewable Energy Fund, which utilities pay into when they are unable to meet state requirements for procuring renewable energy. The fund supports programs including competitive grants for non-residential renewable energy projects, rebates for solar installations, and funding for community solar projects benefiting low- to moderate-income residents.


The pending bill would transfer all of the fund’s uncommitted dollars to the general fund, as the state deals with ongoing budget shortfalls. Then, from 2027 on, most of the money that flows into the renewable energy fund would be returned to residents as a rebate on their electric bill. The fund would only retain enough money to cover administrative costs and the budget of the state’s offshore wind and energy innovation office — a total of $660,000 in fiscal year 2024 — as well as incentive programs at the discretion of the New Hampshire Energy Department.
“It would effectively eliminate the fund,” said Nick Krakoff, senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation.
The fund’s annual revenue has ranged from less than $1.4 million to more than $19 million since it was launched in 2007. In 2023, the last year for which numbers are available, the fund took in $5.9 million and disbursed about $4.5 million. The awards included a $140,000 grant expected to cover most of the cost for a solar installation on housing for older adults in Portsmouth, and a $400,000 grant to support a biomass-burning system to provide heat and air conditioning to an assisted-living community.












Projects like these would be at risk if the proposal to return renewable energy fund money to utility customers becomes a reality, Krakoff said. ​“They’re unlikely to be able to make up that money elsewhere,” he said.


Vose acknowledged that the plan for the fund would deprive some proposed projects of access to money, but said tackling high energy bills is more important right now. In addition, the renewable energy market has developed to a point at which it might not need as much support from state incentives anymore, he said.


“A vast majority of the legislative caucus in the House thought it was more important to save ratepayers some money at this particular point in time,” Vose said. ​“It’s time to start rethinking what kind of money we’re spending on these projects.”


The bill is now under consideration in the Senate. Supporters and opponents alike expect the Senate to remove the provision that funnels money out of the renewable energy fund, though that does not mean it will be completely off the table. It is possible the measure could be restored when the two chambers conference to resolve the differences in their versions of the bill, Vose said.


Otherwise, it is probable the idea will return as a standalone bill at the beginning of next year, he said. It would likely be joined by another measure adjusting some of the requirements for renewable energy procurement by utilities and lowering the payments they make into the fund for noncompliance.


That, said Paul, is where these ideas belong: In their own bills, facing public scrutiny, rather than deep within a budget implementation bill.
“I don’t think these are proposals that would pass on their own,” he said. ​“They are deeply unpopular, and they don’t make any sense.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/statehousemedex-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-19 05:00:56.186048

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector) 
 In partnership with Public Health Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom focused on public health inequities, Kansas Reflector is examining the overlap between housing and health as rates of homelessness continue to rise and access to affordable health care remains out of reach.

PITTSBURG — Stevie and Brandon Perez could not stay awake any longer. They found two chairs in Mercy Hospital’s intensive care unit waiting room, a place they knew would be open, and they drifted off.
Around 1 a.m., a hospital staff member shook them awake: “You guys gotta go.”
It was time to move again, but this time would be the last.
They were serious.
Stevie and Brandon mostly walked around at night. They would stay with friends, sleep in people’s yards or camp in public places, sometimes in the shelter of playground equipment.
“It was,” Stevie said, then paused.  “It was. It was very degrading.”
They were sick and tired of living on the streets. Cold winters. Glares and murmurs from other residents of Pittsburg. Drug addiction. It had become unbearable. It had become life-threatening.
In southeast Kansas, which is home to the highest poverty rates in the state, collaborative solutions tailored to the needs of the community have proven successful in addressing homelessness and in shrinking uninsured rates for people like Stevie and Brandon. These programs act as safety nets for people whom traditional systems leave behind. The Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas is one of those safety nets, expanding the definition of health care to consider every aspect of a person’s life, including housing.
Stevie and Brandon, at the time they were homeless, fell into what health care advocates call the coverage gap, which includes the more than 240,000 Kansans who are uninsured because of unaffordable health insurance. The gap is especially prominent in the 10 states, including Kansas, that haven’t expanded Medicaid to include low-income adults without children or disabilities. 
A parent or caretaker living in a two-person household and making more than $8,100 a year is ineligible for Medicaid in Kansas. The state spends about $10,000 on each of its roughly 427,000 Medicaid patients each year, but as congressional Republican leaders look to cut federal funding for the program, its future here is uncertain, and advocates fear more people could lose coverage.
About one-third of people in the U.S. who have experienced a bout of homelessness in their lifetime relied on Medicaid, a Kaiser Family Foundation survey found. 
In Kansas, relying on Medicaid is nearly impossible.
People who experience homelessness, particularly those who don’t stay in a shelter like Stevie and Brandon, often have unmet health needs and are more likely to have chronic diseases, serious mental health challenges or substance use disorders. Without housing or income, health care is often out of reach. That’s especially true when health care for those with housing and income can be unaffordable and inaccessible.
“The stability of the place came first,” Stevie said. “Then we got better physically and mentally.”
Recovering from drug addiction and a persistent pain in her side, which she suspects is from the years of drug use and living outside, only could be addressed once she had a stable place to sleep.
Then came the job, “and then it was like, sky’s the limit,” she said.
 
Housing as health care
Stevie, 43, was born and raised in Pittsburg, a daughter to a well-off family who took a wrong turn, as she describes it. She is a former pageant kid, which remains evident in her bouncy personality and constant smile. Optimism and gratitude are part of almost every breath, even as she confronts the side effects of homelessness, including rebuilding relationships with her three children.
The first time Becky Gray, the executive director of Building Health Inc. in Pittsburg, met Stevie was at a temporary overnight shelter.
“I was walking in and she held the door open for me,” Gray said. “I said, ‘How are you doing?’ ”
“I’m three days sober,” Stevie told her.
“And she hasn’t come back,” Gray said.
Building Health, a subsidiary of the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, was designed specifically with the relationship between housing and health in mind.
“Housing is health care,” Gray said, “and oftentimes homelessness is preceded by poor health.”
Sometimes it causes it.
People experiencing homelessness — particularly those living in cars, encampments or makeshift shelters — are at a higher risk of contracting infectious and noninfectious diseases, including HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also often face mental illness, alcohol and substance use disorder, diabetes, and heart and lung disease. Homelessness and its side effects shorten a person’s life expectancy by more than 17 years.
Since the 2010 Affordable Care Act authorized Medicaid expansion for low-income adults, experts identified unhoused populations as a group that could benefit from expanded coverage and, in turn, improve public health outcomes. In recent years, the federal government, for the first time, allowed states to use up to 3% of their Medicaid budgets toward specific housing-related services, cementing the link between housing and health. But states have to opt to do so.
Homelessness in Kansas reached its highest number in a decade in 2024, with more than 2,500 people experiencing homelessness on any given night, according to data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Stagnant wages and increasing housing costs have catapulted homelessness numbers in the U.S. since the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Housing and health go hand in hand, according to Becky Gray, the executive director of Building Health, a subsidiary of the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas that seeks to address homelessness with compassion and collaborative solutions. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)
Building Health was formed in 2020 and is just beginning to get off the ground. Gray has a 15-year plan full of meaningful solutions that enable the community to track new housing units and effects on health outcomes in certain areas. With funding from the federal government and a local philanthropic foundation, the project, dubbed “The Station,” will include 10 rental units for people exiting homelessness with supportive services and an adult education center.
“Our homeless program managers are currently designing courses so that when people who are homeless come into our program, we can, in addition to their housing goals, adjust some of their education and employment goals as well,” Gray said.
That includes a model kitchen to prepare people for hospitality jobs and basic courses on how to set up an email account and create a digital calendar. The $4 million project also plans to fund street outreach and access to showers, lockers, laundry machines, telehealth visits and mental health care.
Kansas is at a point, in Gray’s mind, where large-scale change is possible. That’s because statewide organizations have shifted from competition to collaboration, Gray said. Pittsburg is operating as a pilot program, meaning its approach to addressing homelessness is set to be replicated across the state.
 
Everyone matters
Of the more than 443,000 Kansans on Medicaid, 32% of children and 11% of adults live in rural communities, according to the American Hospital Association. Rural areas contain about a third of the state’s population.
Uninsured rates across the state vary, with higher percentages in rural and impoverished areas. The portion of the state’s population without health insurance plateaued at around 8.5%, beginning in 2022. 
Crawford County, where Pittsburg is the largest city with around 20,000 people, has been able to reverse its uninsured rate, despite having one of the highest poverty rates in the state. In 2010, nearly 22% of residents were uninsured. That number shrank to roughly 16% in 2020 and is now around 12%.
The Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas offers care to the region regardless of a patient’s ability to pay. The center is one example among several rural solutions across the state, filling in the coverage gap and turning the tide of generational poverty by fostering healthier communities.
Stevie, a patient at the center, calls it a one-stop shop.
“They’ll go out of their way to make sure you get what you need done,” she said. “They also facilitate everything out there.”
That includes housing help, clothing, transportation, legal assistance and education.
The health center’s headquarters in Pittsburg sit on the grounds of a former hospital run by the Sisters of St. Joseph, who cared for the town’s miners at little to no cost beginning in 1903.
The health center has grown since then into a multimillion-dollar nonprofit receiving grants from the federal government. Its 1,000 employees serve 85,000 patients a year across almost 20 locations in 10 counties in southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. With one foot in the city’s history and another in its future, the health center’s leaders have grappled with how to confront disproportionate levels of poverty and poor health outcomes.
The center’s board of directors realized that only about 30% of a person’s health is affected by what happens in an exam room, said Jason Wesco, president of the health center. Health care providers can’t solve a lifetime of problems in one visit, or even a series of visits, he said.
“I want our providers to feel like they matter and they’re making progress, and often they don’t, because the problems we’re trying to solve have taken 150 years to happen,” he said.
  Jason Wesco, president of the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas, walks around the center’s clinic in north Pittsburg, where patients can receive care regardless of their ability to pay. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)
So he began asking questions about how to house people, create infrastructure for transportation and provide food — the other 70% of a patient’s health.
“At the core of all that is a belief that all this matters,” Wesco said, “that there aren’t throwaway communities, and there aren’t throwaway people.”
At the same time, Wesco tries to cut through the politics of the decidedly political issues of homelessness and affordable, accessible health care.
“I think we waste an awful lot of time blaming, and I think that gets left behind,” Wesco said. “And I think rural communities have this really unique opportunity to solve problems quickly.”
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, has proposed Medicaid expansion each of her seven years in office. The Republican-led Legislature has blocked the proposal every year.
Despite the unpopularity of potential federal Medicaid cuts and the popularity of Medicaid expansion among Kansas residents, Republican leaders continue to demonize the program. House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, applauded the prospect of massive federal cuts.
“For years, we have said that expanding Medicaid beyond those who truly need it will jeopardize the program, and now here we are,” Hawkins said in a May 5 press release. “Our country cannot continue spending money like drunken sailors.”
If Kansas lawmakers were to adopt Medicaid expansion, nearly 150,000 adults and children would gain coverage, and the state would have access to an additional $650 million in federal funding each year, according to a 2023 estimate.
 
Watching her blossom
Since December 2023, Stevie and Brandon have been drug-free and off the streets. They married in March 2024, then moved into an apartment two months later with rental help from a charitable organization as they built up their income from working at a local fried chicken restaurant.
Stevie obtained health insurance from the private marketplace with an affordable plan that is tailored to lower-income earners who can’t qualify for Medicaid. After five years of waiting for public housing assistance, Stevie and Brandon now have subsidized rent, which means they can build up their credit, keep their bills paid and look toward the future.
For Stevie, that could mean owning a home or a career change that puts her college degrees to use, she said. In her free time, she volunteers at a local food bank called Wesley House, which once functioned as a homeless shelter where Stevie spent the night.
“The thing is that they’ve all seen me at my lowest,” she said, “and now they’re all seeing me, like, blossoming.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal)Ohio medical regulators have a warning for the growing number of retail IV hydration clinics in the state: They’re practicing medicine and pharmacy, and if they don’t follow the rules, they could face severe penalties.
The State Medical Board and the Ohio boards of pharmacy and nursing on Thursday released a joint regulatory statement reminding the businesses that they have to adhere to high standards. 
“Retail IV therapy clinics have proliferated across Ohio, often offering the administration of preselected IV fluid ‘cocktails’ that include a mix of saline, vitamins, prescription drugs, and amino acids,” a press release accompanying the joint statement said. “While these services claim to treat conditions such as dehydration, migraines, and to enhance athletic recovery, the Boards emphasize that such IV therapy is a medical practice requiring licensed professionals and compliance with Ohio laws and regulations.”
There are 201 such clinics in Ohio, according to a spreadsheet from the pharmacy board. They administer intravenous infusions promising to cure hangovers and speed recovery from tough workouts. They also said their IVs deliver vitamins and other compounds that can help improve patients’ complexion, boost immune systems and relieve stress.
“Generally, a patient will walk into the business, review the menu of treatment options, complete a health screening questionnaire, and undergo a precursory evaluation (including pulse oximetry, heart rate, blood pressure, review of medications, and allergies) with an employee who is not a prescriber, usually a registered nurse or a paramedic,” the medical regulators’ joint statement said. “The employee will then recommend an IV cocktail, with or without additives, based on the ‘protocol’ established by a licensed prescriber…” 
The regulatory boards said they’re concerned that personnel in the clinics are doing things for which they’re not licensed.
“The operation of a retail IV therapy clinic involves the practice of medicine, nursing, and pharmacy,” the statement said. “The practice of these professions requires a license and adherence to a scope of practice established by Ohio law.  A license to practice these professions is specific to the licensee and does not generally permit the delegation of their scope of practice to any other unlicensed person except under specific laws and rules.”
The statement cites several specific concerns. One has to do with the cocktails the clinics are running into customers’ veins.
“Compounding may only be performed by a licensed pharmacist or licensed health professional authorized to prescribe drugs,” the statement said. “The preparation of IV cocktails as previously described is considered compounding under Ohio law and the clinic is required to obtain a license as a terminal distributor of dangerous drugs… from the Ohio Board of Pharmacy.”
Similarly, the statement said, “The services provided by retail IV therapy clinics constitute the practice of medicine or osteopathic medicine” and must abide by all the licensure requirements and other regulations pertaining to those fields. Violations can result in fines, license suspensions or revocations, and even criminal charges.
In a related matter, the board of pharmacy last week suspended the distribution licenses of two more wellness clinics and those of two out-of-state suppliers.
It suspended the license of Jenerous Hydration in Dover in part on allegations that it was selling retatrutide, a weight-loss drug that hasn’t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It also suspended the license of Brooksville Pharmaceuticals, the Florida-based company that allegedly supplied the compounded drug.
In addition, the pharmacy board suspended the license of Harmony Aesthetics, a spa in Mason, partly on allegations that it had mislabeled a drug meant to ease frown lines. The person in charge there first told inspectors she got the drug from its U.S. distributor, then she admitted she had gotten it at a deep discount through a Facebook group, the report said.
It also suspended the license of CRE8 Pharmacy Group of Coral Springs, Fla., on allegations that it sold compounded drugs to Ohio clinics that contained unapproved components.
The pharmacy board already this year has suspended the licenses of more than a half-dozen spas, largely over their practices regarding high-demand GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. As retail hydration clinics boom, suspensions related to their practices seem likely.

The committee had four hearings on the budget, which Senate lawmakers are currently working on. The Ohio House passed the budget last month and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine must sign the budget by June 30.

Todd Jones, president and general counsel of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio (AICUO), spoke out against provisions the Ohio House added to the budget regarding new requirements for private colleges if they want to continue to participate in the Governor’s Merit Scholarship, which gives the top 5% of each high school graduating class a $5,000 scholarship each year to go to an Ohio college or university.
Under the new changes made in the House, private colleges would also have to accept the top 10% of Ohio’s graduating class and comply with parts of Senate Bill 1 — Ohio’s new higher education law that bans diversity and inclusion efforts and regulates classroom discussion, among other things. 
“I want to be clear that our concerns are not about DEI and SB 1,” Jones said. “Our concerns are about the very nature of our institutions and what it means to be a private, nonprofit institution. … When the state dictates our missions, board structures, curriculum, hiring practices, workloads, and public engagement, the autonomy that defines nonprofit institutions disappears.”
Tiffin University President Lillian Schumacher said the S.B. 1 mandates would increase operational costs without improving educational outcomes.
“For many institutions, these new burdens could lead to closures, reduced financial aid, higher tuition, and a reduction in critical educational services for students,” she said in her testimony.
Forcing private colleges and universities to accept the top 10% of Ohio’s graduating class would create challenges for those institutions, Chancellor of the Ohio Department of Higher Education Mike Duffey said.
“Public universities have the infrastructure with branch campuses, large-scale facilities, and state funding to absorb enrollment increases,” Jones said. “Independent institutions operate on much smaller scales.” 
Eight AICUO institutions function out of a single academic building, he said. 
“Imposing this mandate without providing financial or logistical support places an impractical burden on private colleges,” Jones said.  
Being able to welcome an additional influx of students depends on various factors including the students’ major, housing and financial needs, University of Findlay President Kathy Fell said. 
“I know we all agree that students will not benefit from this opportunity if approbate supports and resources for success are not available,” she said in her testimony. 
Aultman College President Jean Paddock said the 10% acceptance mandate would not be possible in healthcare programs that are limited to a capped number of seats.
“With a nursing shortage well documented, sending our best and brightest who want to enter the healthcare field to other states is the opposite of what we want,” Paddock said in her testimony.
The Governor’s Merit Scholarship was enacted through the last state budget two years ago and 76% of the state’s 6,250 eligible students from the class of 2024 accepted the scholarship. The acceptance rate was 100% in Hocking, Holmes, Putnam, Adams, Monroe, Noble, and Vinton counties, Duffey said.
In the second year of the scholarship, 87% of Ohio students accepted the scholarship and 11 rural counties had a 100% acceptance rate, Duffey said. 
Ohio Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, said she has received several inquiries from private colleges and universities with concerns about the Governor’s Merit Scholarship requirements being linked to compliance with parts of S.B. 1. 
“Clearly we would lose some students if they weren’t able to access those funds,” Duffey said. 
The budget currently allocates $47 million for fiscal year 2026 and $70 million for fiscal year 2027 for the Governor’s Merit Scholarship.

(Ron Osborn photo)Montgomery County in southeast Kansas is an isolated place.
Two-lane, often shoulderless, highways lead into the main towns: Independence, Coffeyville, Cherryvale and Caney. With an ever-declining population of 31,448, most rural residents have no access to high-speed internet unless they want to spring for Elon Musk’s Starlink. TV antennas don’t really work. Dish and streaming services offer network TV channels out of Oklahoma and Missouri, further isolating residents from Kansas news.
When Kansas went 57.2 percent for Donald Trump in the 2024 election, Montgomery County residents gave him 74.7 percent of their vote. In the heart of this red bastion, a group of protesters persevere. Who are they, and what do they think they can accomplish?
Carol Sanders, chairwoman of the Montgomery County Democratic Party, plays a major role in organizing the rallies, but the system has a grassroots feel. People just invite people and post Facebook calls to anyone feeling the need to make a statement or find community.
Now 72, Sanders doesn’t have a long history of protests. Her activism started in 2017 when Trump was first elected.
When asked her motivation, Sanders paused before she sighing and launching into a list of issues: abortion, immigration, Ukraine, economics, LGBTQ+ rights, and the separation of church and state.
“Really, I guess what it comes down to is a threat to our democracy,” she said. “What is going on is abhorrent to me.”
Sanders continued: “I was a Republican for years. I voted. I paid attention, to some degree, to the news. I never in a million years thought I would be organizing political protests.”
A retired system analyst for Phillips Petroleum, educated at Kansas State University, Sanders stood in front of Memorial Hall on April 10 in Independence with approximately 35 others. She held a sign saying “Democracy Is At Risk!!” Other signs supported medical research, Ukraine, human rights and denounced DOGE (unfortunately spelled Dodge).
Debbie Dye stood with Sanders on the steps facing the traffic on Highway 75. Some cars honked, making the protesters cheer. Dye’s reasons for braving the 28 mph wind gusts were personal.
“I have three daughters, and one benefited from Kansas University’s Cancer Research,” she said. “Hearing of research cuts for KU broke my heart.”
She also found community: “Being here makes me feel I’m not alone.”
Dye, 74, has six grandchildren from her three daughters and one great-grandchild. Retired after 25 years as a paraprofessional for the Tri-County Education Co-op, she still volunteers as a tutor. Her activism started when her daughters were in local public schools and Dye became involved in reducing class size.
“I went to PTA meetings. I spoke at board meetings, and I saw the system worked,” she said.
Two high-school aged boys walked along the sidewalk through the protesters. One respectfully asked Dye why she was there.
She explained: “My mother had better health care options than my granddaughter. I grew up here and I had such a great life. I want that a for you.”
They thanked her and moved off toward the local Sonic.
Ivory Porter, 42, has attended three of the Montgomery County protests and one Labette County town hall meeting.
“It’s important to stand up and fight back,” she said. “Plus, it lets like-minded people know they are not alone.”
Porter received her Anthropology degree from Kansas State University when she was only 20. She works nearly full-time substitute teaching for area schools.
“I just protest because I know it’s the right thing to do,” she said.
Dale Belcher, a male-minority member of the group, said he had been a Republican most of his voting years. Now 68, the retired music teacher was motivated to march for many of the same reasons that found him serving in the Peace Corps in Jamaica for two years after college. He wants a better world.
“I don’t like controversy,” he said. “I’ve never protested before in my life and I’m basically a conflict avoider.”
So why is he standing with a red, white and blue banner waiting for an approving car honk?
“I’ve done everything right,” Belcher said. “I voted. I worked election jobs, and now I’m really frustrated. For me it’s about respect. … Respect for all people, the economy, immigrants, science.”
None of the protesters appeared to fit Trump’s label of “Radical Left Lunatics,” and none appeared to be “fighting hard to bring Murderers, Drug Lords, Dangerous Prisoners, the Mentally Insane and well known MS-13 Gang Members and Wife Beaters back into our country,” as a recent Trump social media post warned us.
Turnout fluctuates depending on weather and what community activities lure the faithful away, but Sanders plans more events. So far there have been four protests in Independence and three in Coffeyville. On May 3, protesters gathered at the junction of US 169 and US 166 in Coffeyville . Sanders will call for the first gathering in her home town of Caney (“the reddest town in Montgomery County,” she said) on May 31.
None of the Montgomery County protesters seemed likely to key a Tesla or “conduct an illegal boycott” to make their points. Teslas in Montgomery County are elusive anyway. Even the protesters seemed unsure just how their actions were going to effect change. Still, they hope their stance will residents consider the costs incurred by the current administration.
As Dye summed it up: “I just had to do something.”

Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
Vets fret as private equity snaps up clinics, pet care companies

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

Jim Pillen for his signature to transform them into state laws. If you’re keeping score at home (Pro tip: You should be.), that’s nearly six times more than the U.S. Congress has sent along to the president to become federal law as of this writing. 
And one of those was a simple continuing resolution, which meant Washington pols couldn’t agree on how to fund the government, so they did some can-kicking down the road towards a place called Do Nothing Congressville. 
Federal lawmakers would do well to emulate the Unicameral’s 2025 output. That said, the measures that landed on Pillen’s desk — despite earning enough votes to arrive there — surely came with a variety of opinions about either their efficacy or their expedience. Some good. Some not so. A couple stinkers.
What they’re doing
Obviously, the governor could veto any of them. Suffice to say, however, that the ideas and principles contained within those 31 were something enough state senators liked.
A drone’s eye view of the proceedings reveal what you might expect: We’re against smut, illicit drugs and thieves, and we’re for interruption-free school days and lowering property taxes.
Some were even legislative slam dunks, passing 49-0. Still others were big vote getters such as LB 383, which requires you to be at least 18 to establish a social media account and prohibits the use of AI to generate pornographic images of minors. We’re also about to codify what many school districts already do: ban cell phones in public schools during the day, and to just say no to sales of lab-grown meat, making sure our cheeseburgers have parents other than petri dishes.
Among the senators’ handiwork was a dead aim at assorted crooks and ne’er do wells who use ATM and gas pump skimmers and their felonious brothers and sisters in the business of shoplifting for profit: stealing and then reselling or fencing the pilfered goods. One bill, LB 230, regulates the sale of tianeptine, known as “gas station heroin,” sold as a dietary supplement but which can be dangerous, even deadly. 
A two-year budget closed a looming deficit for now, and some property tax relief may be on the way, but some other high profile subjects were left in committee or on the legislative chamber floor for lack of votes. Such is a representative form of government.
Devil in details
Senators also found a number of devils in the details of trying to mitigate the will of Nebraska voters by tweaking the minimum wage law, which voters approved at the ballot box. Playing footsie with ways to diminish the wishes of voters never plays well in the Legislature, despite new and creative ways to dress up the idea.
Even LB 89, among the session’s most contentious proposals, the “Stand With Women Act” has — thankfully —moved away from policing bathrooms and locker areas to address only the “fairness” issue through a gender lens in high school and college athletics. That alone is one of modern society’s stickiest wickets, so getting off the toilet and locker snide was a reasonable step for legislators.
Nevertheless, to my knowledge, during the entire discussion and debate of LB 89, little if any evidence was provided that men were regularly using women’s bathrooms in Nebraska … or anyplace else for that matter. While I’ve read of no particularly solid, universal solution to the transgender athletes and competitive sports conundrum, the incessant attention the Legislature has paid to this issue — not uncommon among state legislatures — can work against those in the transgender community as they feel put upon and devalued. 
Finding legislation that addresses these issues without such side effects would be a real legislative triumph. Thinking it can be done is a start.
Finally, if we really want to stand with women, we should do so comprehensively. To their credit, lawmakers did just that when they voted 49-0 for LB 78, which gives housing support to survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking. 
Protecting young women from unfairness on the playing fields or intruders in their private spaces may be one thing, but in a state where, according to the World Population Review, over a third of Nebraska women have experienced domestic abuse, including intimate partner violence, standing with women should include working to reduce that number, too.
The Legislature will still add to the pile on the governor’s desk. To the state’s Congressional delegation and the other 430 elected to do the people’s business: Take note.

State regulators oversee Georgia Power rate cases. John McCosh/Georgia Power (file)Monday is the last day to register to vote in the June 17 primary to fill two Georgia Public Service Commission seats on an embattled board that has faced criticism for a series of Georgia Power rate hikes over the last several years.
Winners of the upcoming primaries will face off in November to determine who will serve on the five-member charged with regulating a number of  telecommunications, electricity and natural gas services across the state. The winners will serve on a board that has approved six utility rate increases since 2023 for Georgia Power customers.
This year’s primary and general elections will mark the first time since 2020 PSC contests have appeared on Georgia ballots following lawsuits challenging redistricting and the fairness of the PSC election process for Black voters. Typically, the terms of the five commission districts are staggered over a six-year period.
The 2025 PSC early voting period for the primary election will be held from May 27 to June 13.
If no candidate receives 50% of the vote in the June 17 election, a runoff election will be held on July 15.
Georgians can find information about registering to vote and more about elections on the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.
Currently, Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Fitz Johnson are facing challengers seeking to upset their bids to remain on the board. The other three members of the board are also Republicans.
Echols, who is seeking his third term on the PSC, will face challenger Lee Muns in the Republican primary for the commission’s District 2 seat. Whoever wins will go on to face Alicia Johnson of Savannah, the sole candidate for the Democratic Party.
Although the commissioners must reside in the geographical district that they represent, every Georgia voter can determine the winner since the state regulators are elected statewide.
There is a large field of candidates for the metro and suburban Atlanta area represented by Johnson, who is seeking re-election after being appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp to fill a vacancy in 2021.
One of the Democratic candidates is Daniel Blackman, who served as a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden, and went to a run-off against incumbent Lauren “Bubba” McDonald in the 2020 Public Service Commission election.
The District 3 Democratic primary also includes Keisha Waites, a former member of the Atlanta City Council and the Georgia House of Representatives, as well as Peter Hubbard, founder of Center for Energy Solutions who has been an expert witness at PSC hearings, and Robert Jones, who has had a career involved in energy regulation in California.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Friday that a residency challenge has been filed against Blackman after he moved into the PSC district one day before the deadline for candidates.
Since the start of 2023, the average Georgia Power residential customer is paying about $43 more to cover base electric rate increases, recover excess fuel expenses, and cover the cost of completing two nuclear power generators at the Plant Vogtle expansion.
The Southern Company subsidiary serves about 2.7 million customers and is the state’s largest supplier of electricity.
Georgia Power’s 2025 resource plan details the company’s ambitious energy deployment goals for the next decade, including accelerated plans to add both fossil fuel and clean energy sources.
Georgia Power projects that over the next decade the growth of data centers will significantly increase the state’s electricity consumption. The proliferation of data centers has become a source of consternation for a number of consumer and environmental watchdogs.
There has been some optimism among Republican members of the PSC that the new federal administration under President Donald Trump will curb inflation and stabilize some of the high electricity bills Georgians pay. Additionally, they stated that they supported efforts to increase solar production and usage in the state.
Georgia isn’t the only state with customers frustrated about rising utility costs. Consumer education nonprofit PowerLines and the polling company Ipsos conducted a nationwide survey in March that revealed 73% of 2,000 respondents were concerned about rising energy prices.
“The results held consistent across the political spectrum, with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike expressing similar levels of concern,” the report said.
However, 90% of respondents could not identify the name of the state regulator that oversees gas and electric bills.

Free.,"Conservatives on U.S. House Budget Committee switch votes, advance GOP package",Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/conservatives-us-house-budget-committee-switch-votes-advance-gop-package,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans on the Budget Committee moved the “one big, beautiful” reconciliation bill a step closer to the chamber floor in a rare Sunday night vote after a handful of conservatives blocked the bill Friday. The massive deal squeaked through on a 17-16 vote, with four far-right panel members voting “present.” They were Reps. Josh Brecheen of Oklahoma, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Chip Roy of Texas. All four voted no on the bill Friday.Rep. Lloyd Smucker of Pennsylvania flipped his Friday vote of “no” to support the massive budget reconciliation deal that cuts safety net programs to pay for extending, and expanding, President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law — at a cost of $3.8 trillion over the next decade.Smucker, the panel’s vice chair, switched his vote Friday because of committee procedural rules that allowed him to propose reconsideration of the measure.Brecheen, Clyde, Norman and Roy voted “no” on Friday after demanding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients begin prior to the bill’s stated date of 2029, and that clean energy tax credits phase out at a faster pace.Roy wrote on social media Sunday night that he changed his vote “out of respect for the Republican Conference and the President to move the bill forward” but that the bill “does not yet meet the moment.”Other details on why the members changed their votes to “present” were unclear. When asked by Democrats on the panel whether anything had changed in the bill, Budget Committee Chair Jody Arrington said negotiations were “fluid.”“Deliberations continue at this very moment. They will continue on into the week, and I suspect right up until the time we put this big, beautiful bill on the floor of the House,” said Arrington of Texas.Ranking Member Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania said his side of the aisle wanted “transparency.”“If the bill has changed and there's been some side agreement reached, I think it's important that all the members have the full details on that in advance of any vote,” Boyle said.Massive billThe committee’s tense Sunday night meeting began nearly 30 minutes late.House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana told reporters on Capitol Hill shortly beforehand that talks were going “great” and that “minor modifications” had been made over the weekend.The 1,116-page bill package that includes bills from 11 separate committees will now need to clear the House Committee on Rules to advance to a full House vote. House members are set to leave for Memorial Day recess on Thursday.As written, the bill cuts more than $600 billion over the next decade from Medicaid, the government health program for low-income individuals as well as those with disabilities.Credit downgradeSunday night’s vote came just two days after Moody’s Ratings downgraded the U.S. government’s credit rating, citing a gloomy outlook for U.S. debt and interest burdens.“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” a Friday statement from the investment rating service read. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”The reconciliation package could add up to $3.3 trillion to the national debt through 2034, reaching $5.2 trillion if temporary provisions are made permanent, according to analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Congressional Budget Office has not yet released scores for all parts of the megabill.The far-right House Freedom Caucus board released a statement shortly after Sunday night’s vote, saying the bill continues to increase deficits “with possible savings years down the road that may never materialize.”“Thanks to discussions over the weekend, the bill will be closer to the budget resolution framework we agreed upon in the House in April, but it fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget,” according to the statement posted on social media.Members of the caucus who do not serve on the Budget Committee made similar public statements.“America faces the reality of financial insolvency and looming bankruptcy. For 9 years, I have remained faithful to principles that include an end to the continuous growth of FedGov deficit spending. I will not support a federal budget that increases federal deficit spending,” GOP Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana wrote on his X profile Sunday.Republican Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee wrote on the social media site, “The Moody’s downgrade is yet another wake up call. We need to decrease spending immediately!”Thin marginsAs expected, and following Friday’s same result, Democrats on the panel voted unanimously against the package.Republicans hold a slim 220-213 margin in the House, meaning that if more than three Republicans vote with Democrats — who are all expected to vote against the package — the bill would fail on the floor.Republicans swiftly voted down several last-ditch efforts by Democrats on the panel to protect low-income health care and food assistance programs, as well as clean energy and manufacturing tax credits.Johnson must also contend with a parallel — and expensive — fight among his conference on the state and local taxes, or SALT, deduction.

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)Pennsylvania voters head to the polls on Tuesday for the 2025 primary election. 
In the first election since Donald Trump won back the White House, Democratic voters across Pennsylvania are selecting who they want to be their mayoral candidates in several of the state’s biggest cities. 
After suffering significant defeats in 2024, which included losing a U.S. Senate seat, all three statewide row offices and two congressional districts, the primary races may indicate which direction the Democratic Party will be taking over the next few years.
Most of the state’s largest cities have contested primary elections, with the exception of York, an outlier in this cycle, with only one candidate being on the ballot for mayor. Since most of these cities are Democratic strongholds, the winner of the primary election will likely have an easy path to victory in November. (In Pennsylvania’s closed primary system, only registered Democrats and Republicans can vote in their party’s primaries.)  
Here are a few cities where voters will select nominees for mayor on Tuesday. 
Pittsburgh’s primary 
Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey made history four years ago by defeating incumbent Bill Peduto – becoming the city’s first Black mayor and the first challenger to defeat a sitting mayor since 1933.
Now, he is trying to avoid becoming the second incumbent mayor in a row to lose a re-election bid. 
Gainey faces a strong challenge from Allegheny County Controller Corey O’Connor in tomorrow’s Democratic primary, which will likely determine the next mayor in the heavily blue city. (Pittsburgh hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1934).

O’Connor, a former city councilman and the son of former Mayor Bob O’Connor, has out-raised Gainey, received big support from developers and has been endorsed by the city’s trade unions. He has drawn some heat for accepting support from mega-donors to Donald Trump. 
In ads, O’Connor has targeted Gainey over blight and crime. He’s also gone after the police chief’s sudden decision to retire after public controversy because he was working part-time on the side as NCAA basketball referee. 
“Our city needs stable, dedicated leadership, not revolving door appointments or part-time commitments,” O’Connor told WESA last month. “I will ensure we have a chief who is focused on rebuilding trust, strengthening Pittsburgh’s public safety and delivering real results for our community.”
O’Connor did not respond to requests for comment. 
Gainey supporters have shot back that homicides and nonfatal shootings have dropped due to Gainey’s use of more community-based violence prevention programs. Several prominent African-American groups have accused O’Connor and his allies of using “racist tactics” by focusing heavily on crime in his attacks against the Black mayor. The city is about 22% Black.
They’ve also sparred over development, with O’Connor saying Gainey has slowed housing growth in the city. O’Connor disagrees with Gainey’s push for citywide “inclusionary zoning,” which creates affordable housing requirements for developments in the city, in favor of a more neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach.

Noting developers have supported O’Connor by a margin of 4-to-1, Gainey said attacks on his zoning initiatives are yet another sign that O’Connor is the candidate of the developers. 
“For decades, the rich and developers have ruled things in this city and now with Corey O’Connor, they want to take back that power because I am trying to help poor people,” Gainey told the Capital-Star. 
The conflict between Israel and Palestine has also played a role in the race. In August, Gainey’s communication director, Maria Montaño, resigned after blowback stemming from her signature on a petition calling on the city to avoid firms with ties to Israel. 
Gainey also apologized for “mistakes” in a statement he signed onto on the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas that was criticized as “victim blaming” by the Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh. 
“We have asked time and time again for (Gainey) to be our ally and to stand up for us — and unfortunately, we have been met with great disappointment,” Jeremy Kazzaz, executive director of the local Beacon Coalition, a pro-Israel Jewish advocacy group, told Jewish Insider earlier this year. 
Allentown
Voters in the state’s third largest city will also cast their ballots to determine if their incumbent mayor will serve a second term. 
Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk and Allentown City Councilmember Ed Zucal are both vying for the Democratic Party nomination. 
Tuerk, seeking a second term, made history in 2021 when he became the first Latino mayor in the city’s history. He writes on his campaign website that he “will continue to bring a fresh voice to City Hall, maintaining a focus on the power of partnerships and building coalitions, not tearing it down and trying to build it back up.”
“Our government will continue to be run effectively and efficiently, serving all of Allentown’s residents and reflecting the incredible diversity of the city,” the site says. 
Zucal, a two-term city council member, says on his campaign website that he’s “tired of seeing our residents get ignored.” 
“It’s time to get back to basics, put residents first, and deliver results for the people of Allentown,” he said. 
Tuerk has a fundraising advantage over Zucal, according to Armchair Lehigh Valley. The incumbent has raised $50,970 from January through May 5, while Zucal raised $21,279 in that same time period. Tuerk’s campaign had $32,981 on hand at the end of the filing period on April 30, while Zucal’s campaign had $31,022.
In 2021, Tuerk, a longtime economic development official, unseated incumbent Mayor Ray O’Connell in the Democratic Party primary by a narrow margin in the six-candidate race for the nomination. He cruised to victory in the general election over Republican Tim Ramos.
Depending on Tuesday’s outcome, it may not be the only time Tuerk and Zucal face off this year. No Republicans have filed to run for mayor, although Zucal is also actively seeking Republican write-in votes, which may pit the two candidates against each other in the general election.

Erie
Erie Mayor Joe Schember, who is seeking a third and final term, is facing two challengers in the Democratic primary.
“Despite the pandemic, despite the societal issues, and despite the financial challenges facing the city, my administration has made significant progress in positioning Erie for a more prosperous future,” Schember writes on his campaign website. “I remain committed to my mission: build opportunity, restore hope, transform Erie. In my first six-plus years, I have remained open, honest, transparent, and accessible, and that will continue as long as I am mayor.”
Daria Devlin, an Erie School Board member, and Sheila Woeger, a retired teacher, are also both hoping to lead the northwest Pennsylvania city. 
Devlin said in a campaign video that it’s “time for change” in Erie.  
“For too long, we’ve been sleeping on our potential as a city, and the time to act is now,” Devlin said. “Working families can’t wait four more years to find affordable housing. Can’t wait for jobs to come back. Can’t wait for the safe streets our kids deserve.”
Woeger told Erie News-Now that her top priority is to “look at the books and go over the budget line-by-line to see how the money is being spent and that it’s going to the appropriate places,” adding she also wants to meet with city employees one-on-one to see what Erie can do better.
According to Erie News-Now, the race is believed to be the first time two mayoral candidates in Erie have raised more than $200,000. Schember raised $203,841 from Jan. 1 to May 5, while Devlin’s campaign has raised $217,840 since launching her candidacy last year.
The Erie County Democratic Party endorsed Devlin over Schember and Woeger.
During his successful 2021 campaign, Schember cruised to victory over Democratic challengers Tom Spagel and Sydney Zimmerman. In 2017, he was first elected to the office after winning a crowded seven candidate race for the Democratic Party nomination. 
The Erie-Times News notes that the winner of the Democratic Party primary will be a “huge favorite” given the party’s registration advantage and that no Republican has been elected mayor since 1961. 
The winner of the Democratic primary will likely face Republican Matthew Thomas, an attorney and sole GOP candidate, in the general election. 
Scranton
The race to lead the Electric City includes several candidates, although just two are featured in the Democratic Party primary: incumbent Mayor Paige Cognetti and Robert Sheridan, a former Scranton School Board member. 
Cognetti is seeking her second full term in office. She was first elected to the office as an independent in 2019 in a seven-candidate special election to fill the seat previously held by Mayor Bill Courtwright, who was sentenced to prison on public corruption charges.
She ran as a Democrat in 2021 and coasted to victory in the primary election over Scranton City Controller John Murray. Cognetti went on to defeat Republican Darwin Lee Shaw II in the general election. 
Prior to winning a school board seat in 2009, Sheridan ran for multiple offices in the past, including the Republican nomination for mayor in 2001, although he lost in the primary election. Sheridan is also the Scranton Democratic Party chairman.
Former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a lifelong Scranton resident, has backed Cognetti’s campaign.
Patricia Beynon, an accounting executive, and Lynn Labrosky, a business owner, are vying for the Republican Party nomination, while Scranton Councilman Gene Barrett is running as an independent.
Bethlehem
William Reynolds, seeking a second term in office, is going up against city Councilwoman Grace Crampsie Smith in the Democratic Party mayoral primary. 
According to Armchair Lehigh Valley, the incumbent has the fundraising edge. Reynolds had $123,379 in total funds from Feb. 1 to May 5, while Crampsie Smith’s campaign had $73,945. Armchair Lehigh Valley has also reported the two “have often clashed on city issues, especially when it comes to creating more affordable housing.”
In 2021, Reynolds, then a Bethlehem City Councilman, won the Democratic party nomination for mayor over former city administrative employee Dana Grubb and later won the general election. In that same year, Crampsie Smith was the top vote getter for the four open seats on Bethlehem City Council, per Armchair Lehigh Valley.
No Republicans have filed for the race, meaning the winner of the Democratic Party primary will likely be elected to the office for the next four years. 
Lancaster
The race for mayor of Lancaster is one of the contests that is an open race after Mayor Danene Sorace announced in July 2024 that she would not seek a third term. 
City Council Vice President Jaime Arroyo and Councilwoman Janet Diaz are seeking the Democratic Party nod, while no Republican challengers have filed for the race.
Arroyo has been endorsed by the Lancaster City Democratic Committee, the Pennsylvania Working Families Party, and Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania PAC, and several local elected officials, including Sorace. Diaz’s campaign website lists endorsements from two Philadelphia City Council members, plus an attorney and a cardiologist in Lancaster.
Harrisburg
The state’s capital also features an incumbent Democrat running for a second term. Wanda Williams, then Harrisburg City Council president, won the Democratic Party nomination in 2021 over incumbent Mayor Eric Papenfuse.
On Tuesday, Williams is facing Harrisburg’s City Treasurer Dan Miller, Harrisburg City Councilman Lamont Jones and community activists Lewis Butts Jr. and Tone Cook Jr. 
PennLive reports that Miller is significantly outraising and outspending the rest of the field. 
There are no Republican candidates that have filed for the primary election. 
  Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (via Krasner campaign)
What about Philly?
Cherelle Parker made history in 2023 when she was elected to become Philadelphia’s 100th mayor and the first woman to hold the position. Although Parker isn’t up for reelection until 2027, the state’s largest city will be voting on a few citywide races on Tuesday, including district attorney.
Democratic primary voters will decide between incumbent Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner and former Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Pat Dugan.
Krasner is seeking a third term and has been endorsed by the Working Families Party, Our Revolution, a progressive political organization, U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-2nd District), and several other Philadelphia lawmakers aligned with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. 
Dugan, who is more moderate, has been largely backed by influential building trades labor unions, as well as multiple elected officials, mostly representing Northeast Philadelphia.

For the second election in a row, the Philadelphia Democratic Party decided to not issue an endorsement in the district attorney race, which the Philadelphia Inquirer described as a “snub” for Krasner. Instead, the party is leaving it up to the individual ward leaders to determine who they want to support in their respective wards. 
Both candidates have raised more than most of the mayoral primary candidates across the state, although Dugan has outpaced Krasner since he declared his candidacy. WHYY reports that between November 2024 and May 2025, Dugan raised about $900,700, while Krasner’s campaign raised more than $499,900 during the same time period.
In 2021, Krasner coasted in the Democratic primary, securing a roughly 30 point victory over challenger Carlos Vega. He won by more than 40 points in the general election over Republican candidate Chuck Peruto, to formally secure a second term. 
Running as the progressive outsider, Krasner was first elected in 2017 after winning a seven candidate primary and later defeating Republican Beth Grossman in the general election.
No Republican candidates have filed to run for district attorney. 
While Tuesday’s primary election will likely be decisive, Republicans have started a write-in campaign to nominate Dugan for the general election despite his commitment to not run as a Republican.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-19 04:01:24+00:00,CT Mirror,What fighting antisemitism means to Donald Trump,Robert Helfand,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/19/what-fighting-antisemitism-means-to-donald-trump/,Trump found “very fine people” among the marchers at Charlottesville who chanted “Jews will not replace us.”,"The Trump Administration says it’s “combating anti-semitism” when it arrests students and threatens universities.
 That rationale might be a flimsy pretext, as opponents claim, but it also reflects something subtle and more dangerous. Trump is stealthily narrowing the definition of “antisemitism,” aligning it with ideas that undermine the position of Jewish Americans.
Trump’s administration does not, after all, condemn all ideologies that vilify Jews.  The “Great Replacement Theory” inspired the murders at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue and elsewhere, yet Trump found “very fine people” among the marchers at Charlottesville who chanted “Jews will not replace us.” JD Vance also sees plots to “replace” the white electorate, and Robert Kennedy, Jr., claimed COVID was “ethnically targeted to attack Caucasians” but spare Ashkenazim.
Nor does Trump oppose every form of religious discrimination.  The creator of the “Muslim Ban” served dinner to Nick Fuentes, who draws a hard line between Judaism and “Western civilization,” and he’s invited “proud Islamophobe” Laura Loomer to the White House.
Where Trump has been consistent is in supporting Jewish territorial claims in Israel/Palestine. In his first term, he overturned a decades-old policy declaring West Bank settlements illegal, and he proposed the immediate annexation of large portions of Palestinian territory. He now questions why Israel “gave” Gaza to its residents,[18] and he appointed an ambassador who believes “Abraham and his heirs” hold “the title deed” to the West Bank.
Supporting these policies is not the same as accepting Jews.  The American Jewish Committee says Germany’s Alternativ für Deutschland party has “a clear record of antisemitism.”  Yet AfD’s support for Israel is “unmatched by any other German … party.” Among other goals, that position serves to sanitize AfD’s Christian nationalism.  Its deputy chair connects Israel’s “efforts to preserve its unique culture and traditions” with her own opposition to multiculturalism in Europe, arguing, “The same should be possible for Germany and any other nation.”  AfD’s co-founder asserts, “When we stand with Israel, we are also defending our way of life.”
Trump’s team promotes AfD because he, too, believes our essential identities derive from connections to homogeneous “nations.” By “nation,” he means a privileged subset of the inhabitants of a political territory: as Vance explained at the Republican convention, a “nation” is not a country or an idea, but “a group of people with a shared history.” That’s why Trump opposes birthright citizenship, and why he can casually propose expelling two million Gazans from the place they were born. For Trump, people naturally belong only where their “nation” resides.
This form of nationalism finds the meaning of Judaism in the political movement for a homeland in the Middle East—as when Trump’s Congressional allies declare that anti-Zionism simply “is” antisemitism. But it exposes Jewish Americans to the same threats we face from more conventional Jew-hatred. It allows Trump to tell us Israel is “your country,” and Benjamin Netanyahu is “your prime minister,” making our status in the U.S. a matter of tolerance, not true belonging.
Worse still, Trump makes that tolerance contingent on adherence to his beliefs. If we don’t support the actions of Jewish nationalists abroad, he says, we can’t be truly Jewish, either.  After Democratic politicians first expressed concerns about Netanyahu’s tactics in Gaza, Trump fumed: “Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion … and they should be ashamed of themselves.”  More recently, Trump said of Sen. Chuck Schumer, “He’s not Jewish anymore.  He’s a Palestinian.”
Linking Jewishness to real estate makes Trump see Palestinians as the antithesis of Jews.  In his eyes, a Jew who fails to share that outlook becomes the monster of traditional antisemitic lore: something perverted from its essential nature.
In these ways, Trump’s politicized definition tells a story about “antisemitism” in which most Jewish Americans (the large majority who support the Democratic Party) are the villains —alien perpetrators of “hate” against the Jewish faith.  
This same upside-down logic is now being used to portray the suppression of campus speech as a blow against religious persecution.   Nobody should fall for it.

Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, as they discuss a budget amendment with aide Pete Ecklund, right, on Sunday, May 18, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)This year’s Permanent Fund dividend will be $1,000, according to a final draft state budget approved Sunday afternoon by six House and Senate negotiators.
The dividend was among the biggest items in a $5.9 billion document that will fund state services from July 1 this year through June 30 next year. 
The draft approved Sunday is scheduled for a final vote as soon as Tuesday in the House and Senate and will advance after that to Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who may reduce or eliminate individual line items. He may not increase a line item.
The Legislature’s regular session reaches its constitutional limit on Wednesday.
The latest forecast from the Alaska Department of Revenue expects significantly lower oil and gas revenue over the next year, and lawmakers significantly cut services and programs during the budget drafting process. 
Unlike in previous years, the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend was not a contentious issue for budget negotiators at the end of the legislative session.
Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, said on Sunday that lawmakers had already argued the issue earlier in the session, and even though she unsuccessfully voted for a $1,400 dividend on Sunday, she knew the $1,000 figure would be final.
“From my perspective, I already knew what this number was going to be,” she said.
Compressing the dividend is the state’s precarious budget situation. 
In December, Dunleavy handed lawmakers a budget draft with a $2.1 billion deficit and a $3,900 dividend; the budget will leave the Capitol with a surplus of about $55 million. Legislators expect that surplus will evaporate in the coming months — oil prices are running below the Department of Revenue forecast, and Republican members of Congress are planning to reduce the amount the federal government pays for major programs, including food stamps and disaster relief.
The Senate approved a budget draft with deeper cuts than the final document, but during the compromise process, lawmakers added individual line items preferred by the House, which proposed higher levels of spending and a draw from the Constitutional Budget Reserve, the state’s main savings account, to pay for that spending.
The final version of the budget eliminates that draw from savings, except as needed to cover a deficit remaining in the current fiscal year. 
If lawmakers don’t approve the CBR draw, money would be taken from the state investment bank — better known as the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, or AIDEA — and the state’s education trust fund. 
That will put pressure on members of the House’s 19-person Republican minority caucus, who previously voted against drawing from the CBR. Thirty votes are needed in the 40-person House to spend from the CBR.
The final version of the budget includes an additional $13.7 million for child care programs, $5.7 million more for infant early learning programs and 15 new full-time positions to help process public assistance applications. 
The conference committee, in charge of negotiating the compromise budget, also approved a House proposal to increase funding for behavioral health services used by mentally ill homeless people by $13.75 million.
“The Alaska Behavioral Health Association made a strong case that they need that,” said Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage and chair of the conference committee.
In future years, the state will try to obtain behavioral health funding through federal Medicaid grants.
A $1 million grant to food banks — proposed by the House — was rejected in the final version of the budget, as was funding for public radio.
There will be no new troopers for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough; the committee voted 4-2 to eliminate a section of the House budget that would have re-established the trooper post in Talkeetna. Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage, and Johnson voted in favor of the addition.
Sen. Lyman Hoffman, D-Bethel and a vote against the addition, said that the reopened trooper post was suggested by Gov. Mike Dunleavy who withdrew that proposal — and all of his other proposed budget increases — before the conference committee met.
Johnson said the failure to include the troopers, who could be used to curtail the Railbelt drug trade, was “probably one of the bigger disappointments for me in there.”
The final version of the budget also eliminates a paragraph that sought to restrict gender dysphoria treatment, the kind used by transgender Alaskans. That paragraph was inserted by the House in its budget draft, but the Senate didn’t include it.
Conversely, a paragraph limiting abortion care, adopted by the Senate but rejected by the House, was included in the final budget draft. 
That paragraph has been repeatedly challenged in court, and the effect of including it in the budget is a small cut to Medicaid funding. 
Josephson said the result of the two decisions is a return to the status quo — the Legislature has included the anti-abortion language in its budget for years, and the anti-transgender language was new this year.

Education alone comprises roughly 40% of the general fund budget.
Democratic and Republican legislative leaders hope they can finish their work with a one-day special session before Memorial Day, but that depends on quickly hammering out the most contentious parts of a $66 billion to $67 billion two-year budget that their respective caucuses can support.
That won’t be easy, given the dynamics of a 67-67 House and 34-33 Democratic-Farmer-Labor majority in the Senate.
Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy, DFL-St. Paul, said on TPT Almanac on Friday that this has been the most difficult session of the 18 she’s been through in the Legislature.
Still unresolved is whether the state will roll back access to subsidized health insurance for undocumented adults and cut funding to private schools, both of which have staunch advocates and opponents.
Lawmakers must pass a budget by June 30, or the government shuts down. Only Gov. Tim Walz can call a special session, but only lawmakers can adjourn once they’re in a special session.
While lawmakers and staff scrambled behind the scenes Sunday afternoon, lobbyists turned the television outside the Senate chambers to the pro golf championship to pass the time until more bills came to the floor.
The House and Senate both passed the judiciary policy and budget bill (HF2432), which in addition to funding law enforcement and the courts, approves closing the Stillwater correctional facility over four years. Walz and legislative leaders announced Thursday that they agreed to close the more than century-old prison, which came as a surprise to other lawmakers, who nevertheless have broadly supported the decision.
Rep. Josiah Hill, DFL-Stillwater, said the prison looks worse than the one in “The Shawshank Redemption.” He said it has to be closed, but in the least disruptive way for the prison’s more than 550 full-time workers and 1,200 inmates.
“We need to make sure we get this process right,” Hill said on the House floor on Sunday.
Union leaders representing correctional officers blasted the decision to close the facility, saying it was made without their input.
The Senate also approved a House bill (HF1143) by a wide margin that cancels $77.2 million in funding for a passenger rail line between Minneapolis and Duluth to help school districts pay for unemployment benefits for bus drivers, paraprofessionals and other hourly school workers.
The Northern Lights Express, a longtime dream of Duluth residents and transit enthusiasts, is dependent on winning federal grants to cover the majority of the cost. That funding seems unlikely to materialize under the Trump administration while it pursues drastic cuts that will further strain the state’s tight budget.
The bill didn’t cancel all the funding for the rail project, and Sen. Jen McEwen, DFL-Duluth, said she’s holding out hope that it will happen one day.
“Although we are making a substantial cancellation because of this austerity that is being imposed upon the people of Minnesota … the Northern Lights Express project is still alive,” McEwen said on the Senate floor.
The bill, which passed the House on Friday and is expected to be signed by the governor, would give school districts $100 million for unemployment insurance for hourly school workers.
Republicans have pushed to end the entitlement, which was passed in 2023 under Democratic control. School districts have complained the benefits make it harder to recruit staff to work part-time summer jobs, and that the mandate will take away critical resources for classrooms.
The state has been funding the cost so far, having appropriated $135 million in 2023. There’s about $33 million left in the account, only about half of what’s expected to be needed this summer.
The Senate also passed a bill (SF2884) with bipartisan support that increases pension benefits for public employees, including school teachers, firefighters and state patrol officers. If it becomes law, teachers would be eligible to retire at 60 years old with lower early retirement penalties if they have 30 years of service. State patrol retirees will receive a permanent 1.25% annual increase in their benefits to help keep up with the cost of inflation. The police and fire plan also gets a one-time 3% boost. The bill must still pass the House.
The House and Senate have also passed a bill funding housing and homelessness prevention (SF2298) as well as agriculture, broadband and rural development (HF2446).",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrE9lzpWQAAKeSW-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-05-18 21:59:05.381793

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)NJ Transit and its engineers have reached an agreement to end a three-day strike that entirely stopped rail service on the nation’s busiest commuter rail line, officials announced Sunday.
The deal, which must still be ratified by the union’s members and NJ Transit’s board, comes after a seven-year bargaining standoff that included years of mediation, interventions by two presidential emergency boards, and the first strike to hit the agency in more than 40 years. NJ Transit said service will resume Tuesday.
Details of the tenative agreement remain unknown. Tom Haas, the union’s general chairman at NJ Transit, said it would boost hourly pay for train engineers. Gov. Phil Murphy called the deal “fair and fiscally responsible.”
Though negotiators reached a tentative deal in March that offered wage hikes in line with those accepted by NJ Transit’s 14 other unions, rank-and-file members of the NJ Transit Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen overwhelmingly rejected that agreement.
Engineers argued wage differentials with counterparts at other rail agencies and the lengthy training process for their workers — it takes NJ Transit 20 months to train a locomotive engineer — justified larger wage increases.
Officials at NJ Transit resisted, worrying larger increases would trigger provisions to guarantee similar raises in other unions’ contracts, ballooning the cost of the engineers’ proposal into the hundreds of millions of dollars, costs NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri warned would bankrupt the agency.
In the hours ahead of the Friday’s strike deadline, union negotiators offered concessions on work rules and health benefits that would produce savings for the agency and allow larger raises for engineers without triggering increases for other NJ Transit workers, Haas said Friday.
The impact of the strike on New Jersey’s economy was not immediately clear. NJ Transit’s rail service carries roughly 350,000 riders daily, Kolluri has said, and the agency’s contingency plan for a work stoppage could only handle roughly 20% of that volume, and that at a cost of about $4 million per day.
Negotiations spilled into public acrimony with accusations of bad faith negotiation and mental health issues earlier in May, but the two sides appeared to moderate their tone in the final days before the strike.

 The union has been working under an expired contract since 2019.

Free.,Joe Biden diagnosed with a ‘more aggressive form’ of prostate cancer,Jane Norman,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/joe-biden-diagnosed-more-aggressive-form-prostate-cancer,,"WASHINGTON — Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with “a more aggressive form” of prostate cancer, according to a statement from his office on Sunday.The statement said Biden, 82, last week was seen for a new finding of a prostate nodule after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms. “On Friday, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade group 5) with metastasis to the bone,” the statement said.“While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,” it continued. “The President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.”The New York Times had reported on May 12 that a few days earlier, a “small nodule” was discovered on Biden's prostate that required “further evaluation,” according to a spokesman.According to the National Cancer Institute, prostate cancer is slow-growing, the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States and the most common cancer.‘Joe is a fighter’Statements of support immediately began pouring in on Sunday as word spread of the diagnosis.“Doug and I are saddened to learn of President Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis,” his former vice president and the 2024 Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, said on X. “We are keeping him, Dr. Biden, and their entire family in our hearts and prayers during this time. Joe is a fighter — and I know he will face this challenge with the same strength, resilience, and optimism that have always defined his life and leadership. We are hopeful for a full and speedy recovery.”“Melania and I are saddened to hear about Joe Biden’s recent medical diagnosis,” President Donald Trump wrote on social media. “We extend our warmest and best wishes to Jill and the family, and we wish Joe a fast and successful recovery.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who was the party’s vice presidential candidate after Biden dropped out of the race and  Harris took his place at the top of the ticket, said on X that Biden was “a truly decent man and a friend.”“Gwen and I are praying for President Biden and his family,” he wrote.“I am saddened to hear of President Biden’s cancer diagnosis and am wishing him and his family well as he begins treatment,” Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins wrote on X.Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor who served as Biden’s Transportation secretary after running against Biden, Harris and others in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, said Biden “is a man of deep faith and extraordinary resilience.”“Chasten and I are keeping him, and the entire Biden family, in our prayers for strength and healing,” Buttigieg wrote on X.“Joe has been a fighter his whole life. He will prevail. Sending Dr. Jill Biden and their family my absolute support,” Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania posted on X.“This is very sad news. Praying for his recovery,” GOP Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna said on X. “We are rooting for President Biden in this fight!” former Florida U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz wrote, reposting Luna’s post.Age a factor in presidential raceBiden’s doctors said he was fit and healthy enough to be president after evaluations in February, 2024.“President Biden is a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency,” Dr. Kevin C. O’Connor wrote.But by that summer, Biden’s deteriorating state  — though not connected to the diagnosis disclosed Sunday — would force him out of his reelection bid.Biden dropped out of the race for the presidency on July 21, 2024, creating an unprecedented vacancy atop the Democratic ticket one month before he was scheduled to officially accept his party’s nomination. He endorsed Harris to take his place as the Democratic nominee, and she was nominated by Democrats but lost the election to Trump.Biden’s withdrawal came after a weeks-long pressure campaign from party insiders following a disastrous June 27, 2024, debate performance against GOP candidate Trump and rising criticism that he could not mount a winning campaign against the man he had defeated in 2020. Biden appeared frail and confused at several points during the debate, leading to worries he was no longer up to the task of governing.After leaving the White House on Jan. 20, Biden kept a low profile and did not make public remarks until April 15, when he criticized the current administration for cutting thousands of employees at the Social Security Administration and rebutted those who have questioned the program’s relevance.“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breathtaking it could happen that soon,” Biden said. “They've taken a hatchet to the Social Security Administration, pushing 7,000 employees — 7,000 — out the door in that time, including the most seasoned career officials.”Book publicationIn more recent days, the publication of a book by two political reporters, CNN’s Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson of Axios, sparked controversy by its claims that those in Biden’s inner circle worked to keep his cognitive decline from public view.Titled “Original Sin,” the book — based on interviews with what the authors said were more than 200 people, mostly Democratic insiders —  included new details about the presidency, such as Biden apparently failing to recognize movie star George Clooney at a fundraiser in June 2024 in Los Angeles. Biden’s decline was such in 2023 and 2024 that use of a wheelchair was discussed, if he was reelected, the book reported.Just Friday, the White House released audio of an interview of Biden by Department of Justice special counsel Robert Hur who issued a lengthy report concluding that while President Joe Biden “willfully retained” classified materials following his time as vice president, he would not be charged with a crime.Hur wrote in the 388-page February 2024 report that prosecutors considered “that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”Jacob Fischler contributed to this report.",,,,2025-05-18 19:01:09.912353

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)For a second year in a row, New York City and Los Angeles were among the cities with the most population growth last year as the nation’s largest cities continued to recover from devastating pandemic losses.
The U.S. Census Bureau released new July 2024 city population estimates Thursday.
In New York City, a recent city planning report suggested that “two consecutive years of growth suggest that pandemic-era losses were short-lived.” The city is still almost 328,000 short of its 2020 population, however.
Los Angeles returned to the list of top growth cities for the first time since 2016, according to the Census Bureau.

Are you a teacher, nurse or skilled trades worker looking to buy a house or condo in today’s market? We’d like to talk to you about the experience of trying to buy a home with a household income of around $75,000 a year — email Tim Henderson at thenderson@stateline.org.



The largest one-year population increases for mid-2023 to mid-2024 were New York City (87,184), Houston (43,217), Los Angeles (31,276), and the Texas cities of San Antonio (23,945) and Fort Worth (23,442). The same cities were in the top five the previous year, but the growth is a big turnaround from 2021-22, when New York City lost almost 100,000 people and Los Angeles gained only about 2,000.
A new interest in living in big cities could be impacting rents: Zillow reported this week that there now are eight cities, double the number from 2020, where renters need more than a $100,000 annual income to afford typical rent: New York City ($145,000 needed), San Jose, California ($137,000), Boston ($127,000), San Francisco ($124,000), San Diego ($123,000), Los Angeles ($119,000), Miami ($110,000) and Riverside, California ($103,000).
Homes for sale in the fastest-growing city areas also are getting further out of reach for even moderate-income buyers, according to a National Association of Realtors report also released Thursday. The New York City and Los Angeles areas were listed as “moving in the wrong direction” on affordability, “reflecting a growing divide between what homes actually cost and what local families can afford.”
For instance, even a Los Angeles-area family with a $200,000 income can afford less than a third of the homes listed for sale, including condominiums and townhouses, according to the report.
Houston, San Antonio and the Dallas-Fort Worth area were listed among three tiers as “stuck in the middle” of affordability, “showing signs of progress, yet still falling short of offering real affordability to most families.”
For the four years combined after the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, both New York City and Los Angeles have not completely recovered population. New York City is down almost 328,000 people and Los Angeles is still short about 21,000 since the 2020 census, but they remain the nation’s two largest cities.
The largest percentage growth since 2020 was in some fast-growing suburbs: Westlake, Florida, near Palm Beach, has grown to 7,664, more than eight times its 2020 population, and Josephine, Texas, near Dallas, has quadrupled in size to 8,807. Medicine Lake, Minnesota, west of Minneapolis, also quadrupled, to 1,343.

Terrell McKinney recalls Nebraska’s rockier relationship with Malcolm X, the rather rough road to getting the Omaha-born human rights leader into the state’s Hall of Fame.
John Ewing Jr., who last week became Omaha’s first elected Black mayor, was a toddler when Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965, and what sticks with him is how Nebraskans early on used him largely as a comparison point with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.

Standing out to JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike is the slow march toward gaining communitywide buy-in to build up the Malcolm X memorial birth site and nonprofit foundation she now heads. Burned into her mind is a moment 15 years ago when she thought: “Where’s the people? Where are the people who are going to move this thing forward?”
But they and other fans said they’ve seen increased recognition and understanding in their state of what Malcolm X stood for. Buoyed by his rising national prominence, local voices have championed Malcolm X’s journey as one of self-determination, personal reformation and quest to unify Black people — and have successfully advocated for ways to enshrine his name in the state where he was born.
Efforts intensified as the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birthday approached — and is being observed Monday, May 19.
“There’s a shift of the tide,” McKinney said, for the Black empowerment advocate he says is often misunderstood. “People are actually honoring his legacy and respecting it. It’s a show of understanding of who he was and what he means to North Omaha, the city and the world.”
Racial antagonism abandoned
Born Malcolm Little, his family left Omaha after suffering harassment from white supremacists, before Malcolm X was two years old. He evolved from a street hustler who, while in prison, became self-educated and converted to the Nation of Islam. He took the new surname “X” to signify the unknown African surname of his ancestors.
After completing a pilgrimage to Mecca, Malcolm X had a new outlook that abandoned concepts of racial antagonism. He changed his name again and denounced the Nation of Islam, which led to death threats.
At 39 years old, as he was about to give a speech in New York City in 1965, the father of six daughters was shot multiple times at close range by three gunmen identified as members of the Nation of Islam.

McKinney, a lawmaker who represents the North Omaha area where Malcolm X first lived, reflected on the Little family that he said was a target of racism. Malcolm’s father, a minister, was active in the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which led to the family’s being harassed. McKinney said the Littles would not have fathomed the recent turn of events in Nebraska.
Shifts
Consider these milestones:
In May 2024, the state inducted Malcolm X as the 27th person and first African American into Nebraska’s Hall of Fame. Some along the way thought he was too controversial for the hall the Legislature created in 1961 to recognize Nebraskans who have made significant contributions to the state and nation.
Indeed, it took three different nominations over nearly two decades, in 2004, 2007 and 2022, before he was selected in 2022 by a governor-appointed commission who considered public testimony. The formal induction came two years later, with a bronze bust in Malcolm X’s image installed in the State Capitol. Due to legislation passed in 1998, no more than one person can be added to the Hall of Fame every five years.


Malcolm X, 100 years celebration

	
Various activities, including a block party and youth poetry contest, helped mark the 100th anniversary of Malcolm X’s birth date.
Bus tour “pilgrimages,” which come with an admission cost, will continue through June 1 to view the slain civil rights leader’s bust in the State Capitol — “the very institution that once ignored him,” says the marketing material. Included are presentations, held in partnership with the Black Studies Department at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, to deepen understanding of his legacy and relevance today.
Also part of the celebration is a May 30 free public screening of “Divisible,” a documentary film focusing on the history and current impacts of redlining in Omaha. The show starts at 7 p.m.
A May 31 Legacy Gala at the Durham Museum has an admission cost.

At the induction, former State Sen. Ernie Chambers quipped about what he saw as a near impossibility: “I never thought in my wildest dream that I would live long enough … to see a white conservative Republican governor in a white ultraconservative state like Nebraska participate in the induction of Malcolm X.”
Also in 2024, the Nebraska Legislature passed a law establishing a “recognition” of Malcolm X every year on his birthday. McKinney had pushed for a state holiday, but that measure stalled. He said financial barriers to designating a paid holiday prompted him to change direction. He called the alternative a “good first step.”
The legislation calls for each May 19, starting this year, to be “set apart for holding suitable exercises in the schools of the state in recognition of the sacrifices of the late Nebraska Hall of Fame inductee El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, Malcolm X and his contributions to the betterment of society.” El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz is the name Malcolm adopted after completing the “Hajj” pilgrimage to Mecca and converting to Sunni Islam.
Museum on the horizon
Also in 2024, the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation officially was awarded a $20 million grant from the state to create a museum devoted to its namesake near 35th and Evans Street, a site where Malcolm X first lived with his family. The funds followed through on legislation, approved the previous year, to build the cultural center supporters foresee as a tourist destination.
Originally, the foundation had requested funding through a competitive process set up to dole out economic development grants to North and South Omaha from the state’s federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The museum was not among recommendations by a consultant, however. Amended legislation led by State Sens. Justin Wayne and McKinney carved out funds for the project.
As planned, the public dollars are set to build the museum, which is an anchor of a broader vision to transform the 17-acre campus that marks Malcolm X’s early childhood home.

Construction has yet to launch, but LeFlore-Ejike says planning is “moving along” with a review ongoing of requests that have been submitted for the master site plan development.
LeFlore-Ejike became executive director of the foundation in 2022, taking over work initiated in 1971 by Rowena Moore.
She said efforts to transform the still largely undeveloped area, which has gardens and a visitors center, has had “ebbs and flows.”
LeFlore-Ejike recalled the moment in 2010. She was a volunteer still in school, and the foundation had a grant for “visioning” work after having just purchased the current visitor’s center, which was the former home of a Jehovah’s Witnesses congregation. She recalled disappointment in the lackluster support to continue building momentum.
Now, she said, “We’re finally in a season of harvest.”
Citing LeFlore-Ejike’s work with the foundation, USA Today named her a nominee for its Women of the Year program in 2025. The selection recognizes “heroines” across the country who break barriers, push for change and make communities better.
LeFlore-Ejike hopes Malcolm X supporters are proud that decades of volunteer work “has not been in vain.”
History-making

Malcolm X’s 100th birthday observance comes as Ewing also celebrates a historical win in Nebraska’s largest city. In last Tuesday’s election, he soundly defeated three-term Mayor Jean Stothert.
“It all goes to show how far we’ve come as a community when it comes to being inclusive and accepting of leaders in our community,” he said.
Ewing said leaders “come in all shapes and sizes and backgrounds.”
“It’s important they are accepted and know they belong here in Omaha and in Nebraska.”

Until last month, Nick Panicola was working at two environmental nonprofits in northern Michigan.
His jobs at SEEDS Ecology & Education Centers and Crosshatch Center for Art & Ecology ranged from organizing educational events to community composting. That included developing “a food recycling network in the area, which we just launched a few weeks ago.” He held the positions through AmeriCorps.
Then came a stop work order from the Michigan Community Service Commission at the end of April.
AmeriCorps provides paid community service jobs that span a wide range of fields, from disaster recovery to education, generally through temporary, low-paying positions.
In April, the agency placed most of its staff on leave.
The Trump administration also ended around $400 million dollars in funding for AmeriCorps grants. That was a big chunk of the program’s roughly billion-dollar budget, which effectively ended over 32,000 positions.
And almost instantly, those cuts were felt in communities across the country.
In Michigan, more than $15 million in funding was cancelled. That means nearly 700 people across dozens of organizations won’t receive the rest of their stipends, education awards and other benefits, according to the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, or LEO.
The state was expecting a National Civilian Community Corps team to assist with ice storm recovery. But that program was terminated.
Grants were canceled for MI Healthy Climate Corps, an AmeriCorps program that funded positions — like Panicola’s — at local governments and other organizations to further the state’s climate goals.
In northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, the program provided staff members to several organizations, including the Inter-Tribal Council of Michigan, Groundwork Center for Resilient Communities, the Marquette County Planning Division, and Northern Michigan University.
At the state’s Office of Rural Prosperity, a Climate Corps member worked with rural communities to take advantage of revenue from renewable energy, among other duties, according to Erica Quealy, LEO’s deputy communications director.
In an email to IPR, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote that “Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump is restoring accountability to the entire Executive Branch.”
The AmeriCorps Office of Inspector General’s 2024 audit found that independent auditors found multiple issues but that the agency “took appropriate actions” to address some of the recommendations from the previous year. AmeriCorps didn’t respond to a request for comment on Thursday afternoon.
The agency has also reported that its environmental programs pay for themselves many times over, with high returns on investment.
At the end of April, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined other states in a lawsuit challenging the cuts as unlawful. A group of community organizations and grant recipients from across the country filed a separate lawsuit earlier this month.
The White House did not address IPR’s questions about how AmeriCorps work should be completed moving forward or the legality of the cuts.
Applications for the third cohort of MI Healthy Climate Corps members were still open on the website of the state Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, or EGLE, as of Thursday afternoon.
In an email, EGLE spokesperson Jeff Johnston wrote that the initiative supports Michigan’s leading clean energy job growth, “which currently accounts for over 127,000 jobs and is expanding rapidly,” along with areas like public transit and waste reduction.
Johnston said the department was “disappointed” in the Trump administration’s cuts, adding that the department hopes there will be an outcome that allows the program to continue.
In the meantime, those who were told to stop work are waiting — with little information about what’s next and bills to pay.
“I think we all have to figure out how we’re going to make that work in this time period,” said Panicola, who was in the midst of his term with SEEDS and Crosshatch. “And I think for a lot of us, that might just be in exiting the program and finding a full time job, hopefully within the same framework of what we cared about and what we were doing before.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-17-064610-1024x755.png,,,2025-05-18 14:03:14.729390

Attorney General Pam Bondi sold between $1 million and $5 million worth of shares of Trump Media the same day that President Donald Trump unveiled bruising new tariffs that caused the stock market to plummet, according to records obtained Wednesday by ProPublica.
Trump Media, which runs the social media platform Truth Social, fell 13% in the following days, before rebounding.
Trump’s “Liberation Day” press conference from the White House Rose Garden unveiling the tariffs came after the market closed on April 2. Bondi’s disclosure forms showing her Trump Media sales say the transactions were made on April 2 but do not disclose whether they occurred before or after the market closed.

Trades by government officials informed by nonpublic information learned through work could violate the law. But cases against government officials are legally challenging, and in recent years judges have largely narrowed what constitutes illegal insider trading.
It’s unclear from the public record whether Bondi as attorney general would have known in advance any nonpublic details about the tariffs Trump was announcing that day. Trump, of course, publicly announced his plans to institute dramatic tariffs during the election campaign. But during the first weeks of his term, the market seemed to assume his campaign promises were bluster.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to questions about the trades.
The disclosure forms do not include the specific amount of stocks sold or their worth but instead provide a rough range. The documents do not say exactly what time she sold the shares or at what price. The company’s stock price closed on April 2 at $18.76 and opened the next morning, after the press conference, at $17.92 before falling more in the days ahead. In addition to selling between $1 million and $5 million worth of Trump Media shares, Bondi’s disclosure form shows she also sold between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of warrants in Trump Media, which typically give a holder the right to purchase the shares.
Bondi’s ownership of Trump Media shares has previously been disclosed. Before she became attorney general, Bondi was a consultant for Digital World Acquisition Corp., the special purpose acquisition company that merged with Trump Media to take the president’s social media company public.
As part of her ethics agreement, Bondi had pledged to sell her stake of Trump Media within 90 days of her confirmation, a deadline that would have allowed her until early May to sell the shares.
On April 1, Trump Media filed a disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission with details about holdings of various top shareholders, including Trump and Bondi. The purpose of the filing is unclear, as is whether it relates to Bondi’s sales the next day. It appeared to reregister for sale shares held by several of the company’s top shareholders.

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)Emily Pike’s mother found out that her 14-year-old daughter had been murdered when she saw photos of garbage bags containing human remains posted on social media.
Police didn’t call Stephanie Dosela; she called them after viewing the photos that had been leaked from the Gila County Sheriff’s Department. Emily, a member of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, had been missing for 18 days after running away from a group home in Mesa.
“A mother should not find out on social media about her daughter’s dismembered body,” Dosela said in a written statement to Arizona state legislators on May 14.
The unthinkable way that Dosela said she found out about her daughter’s murder is emblematic of the poor communication and failures of the individual pieces of the tribal, county and state systems — first, to keep Emily safe, and then to find her after she went missing.

During a Joint Legislative Oversight Committee hearing on May 14, Arizona lawmakers heard from law enforcement officials, leaders of the San Carlos Apache Tribe, Emily’s family and the Arizona Department of Child Safety about the failures of the system and ways to prevent what happened to Emily from happening again. Police, legislators and Emily’s family members alike could be seen quietly sobbing at various points during the nearly three-hour-long hearing.
Emily went missing from the Mesa group home on Jan. 27. Her remains were found near Globe, just outside of the reservation where her family lives, on Feb. 14.
But the systemic deficiencies that led her to disable the alarm on her bedroom window and to run away from the Mesa group home date back years.
In 2023, a 911 call was made from a remote area of the San Carlos reservation near Emily’s home, to report that she had been sexually assaulted. But instead of a San Carlos Apache police officer trained in dealing with sexual assaults, the tribe’s fish and game department responded.
San Carlos Apache Police Chief Elliot Sneezy couldn’t tell legislators specifically why fish and game responded instead of one of his officers, but said that fish and game are the experts in finding people in extremely rural areas of the reservation and that police were “busy” that day.
At that time, Sneezy said, there were only 22 police officers on staff to cover the entire 1.8 million acre reservation.
The family member who Emily accused of assaulting her was arrested, but was soon released without being charged. Emily, meanwhile, was taken into the custody of San Carlos Apache social services for her own safety and sent to the Mesa group home.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs previously told the Arizona Republic that it dropped the sexual assault case due to insufficient evidence, but other agencies disputed that claim.
“My niece was a victim, but yet she was punished and removed from her home,” Emily’s uncle, Allred Pike Jr., told legislators. “That’s how justice failed her. The person that she accused of hurting her got to go home. How is that justice? It’s just backwards.”
Terry Ross, director of tribal social services, told the committee that it’s often difficult to prosecute such cases when family members decide to protect the accused.
“What I experience with our tribe is that all the families will support the perpetrator, and we can’t do anything but to remove the child (for their safety),” Ross said.
After tribal social services removed Emily from her home and sent her to Mesa, more than 100 miles away, she attempted suicide and ran away multiple times.
She was placed in a residential mental health treatment facility for more than a year before being released back to the Mesa group home.
In a statement read by family spokesperson Gail Pechuli, Dosela said that Emily experienced culture shock when she was taken from her rural home near the tiny town of Peridot and placed in Mesa, a city of more than 500,000 people in the Phoenix metropolitan area.
“My Emily was far from home, she was alone and homesick,” Dosela said, adding that she told her grandmother that she missed home-cooked traditional foods like acorn soup and tortillas.

Emily lived on the reservation with her mother and other family members. Her father is currently in prison for an arson-related conviction. In her statement, Dosela said that she suffers from addiction issues and lives in poverty, but said she believed Emily was safe in the group home where she was sent.
Sen. Carine Werner, co-chair of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on the Department of Child Safety, said that the group home was not given background information on why Emily was there, something that she said was vital to her caregivers’ understanding of her behavior.
While Emily was living in a facility that is licensed by DCS when she went missing, she was not in the department’s custody — she was in the custody of the tribe, which contracts with the group home for placements. The San Carlos tribe has only one tiny group home on the reservation and must place children in other locations when it’s full.
Because Emily was in the custody of the tribe — a sovereign nation — certain reporting requirements outlined in Arizona law when a child in DCS custody goes missing didn’t apply to her.
Kathryn Ptak, director of the Arizona Department of Child Safety, explained that an amended state law signed last year in response to a surge in runaways from DCS group homes didn’t pertain to Emily because she wasn’t in the DCS system.
The law requires family, friends and the school of the missing child to be contacted within 24 hours of their disappearance to obtain any information about where they might be. It also stipulates that the child’s family and tribe must be contacted by phone and in writing to inform them that the child is missing.
Therein lies one of the major issues identified by numerous people who spoke to the committee: Tribal sovereignty means that the state generally doesn’t have the power to pass laws that control tribes.
DCS has memorandums of understanding with four of Arizona’s tribes, but not currently with San Carlos Apache.
“When a child is living on tribal land and either eligible for enrollment or enrolled in a tribe, the tribe has exclusive jurisdiction,” Ptak said. “The state can’t come in and tell them what to do with their children.”
She added that, because Emily was never in DCS custody, the department didn’t have access to information necessary to contact her family and friends.
Sen. Theresa Hatathlie, a Democrat from Coal Mine Mesa and a member of the Navajo Nation, argued that, no matter their race or tribal affiliation, all missing children should be treated the same.
“Emily Pike was born in the state of Arizona, resided in Arizona all of her life, regardless of what tribe she’s a member of,” Hatathlie said.
The senator added that DCS should not just sit by and refuse to help because of jurisdictional issues.
The group home reported Emily missing to police on Jan. 27, and the tribe was informed the next day. But her tribal case worker did not immediately consider her disappearance an emergency, San Carlos Attorney General Alex Ritchie explained, since she had run away and returned several times before.
San Carlos Apache Social Services didn’t inform Emily’s family that she was missing until she’d been gone for a week.
After Emily’s body was found, the San Carlos Apache tribe called for an investigation into group home licensing, and also agreed to investigate how her sexual assault report was handled.
Several of the speakers on May 14, including Ritchie, recommended that every child who goes missing from a group home be immediately considered missing instead of labeled as a “runaway.”

“Our recommendation is that every child, the moment they’re not accounted for, they are missing,” Ritchie said. “That way the level of scrutiny is heightened. Of course, there will be folks who don’t agree with that, but these are children. They are the most defenseless and the most in need of folks looking out for them.”
But because teens will regularly run away from group homes for the weekend, only to show back up the following Monday, Ptak recommended that reporting requirements be loosened so that group homes wouldn’t be required to report a child missing if they’re told they can’t go somewhere and they leave anyway, especially if caretakers know where they’re headed.
Nearly all of the speakers agreed that better communication between all the entities involved was vital to any attempts to prevent another tragedy like Emily’s death from happening in the future.
Suggestions included better sharing of background information about children in their custody between tribal social services and group homes, that group homes have pertinent information ready to provide to police when they report a child missing and that the tribes enter into agreements with DCS for information sharing about children in the group homes that they license.
Emily’s mother asked that the Gila County Sheriff’s Office look into how it handles the sharing of sensitive information on social media, and that the San Carlos Apache Tribe open a larger group home, with better mental health services, on the reservation.
Sneezy told legislators that group homes that house Native children should be better informed about their cultures, and that law enforcement entities should work on better communication, especially since local law enforcement doesn’t have jurisdiction on tribal land.
“What I’ve heard today is the failure of agencies, our departments, our jurisdictional issues, federal, state, tribal,” Allred Pike said. “We need to stop working in silos. We need to start sharing information. We need to start working together so this won’t happen again.”
The committee plans to host multiple stakeholder meetings in the coming months to figure out workable solutions, with plans to recommend changes in law during the next legislative session in 2026.
“This jurisdictional thing sounds easy but I know it’s not, but I commit, and I’m sure the whole legislature commits to finding solutions to make sure that this never happens again,” said Sen. Hildy Angius, R-Bullhead City.
The Gila County Sheriff’s Office, along with the San Carlos Apache Tribal Police Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the FBI are collaborating in the ongoing investigation into Emily’s murder.
Earlier this week, Gov. Katie Hobbs signed a new law that would create a Turquoise Alert, a new kind of alert that can be issued by the Department of Public Safety when a Native person goes missing. The legislation was introduced before Emily went missing but was renamed “Emily’s Law” after her body was found.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota has about half the number of syphilis cases this year as it did at the same time last year, and about a third as many as the same time in 2022, when the outbreak peaked and the state reported the highest rate in the country.
About 160 cases were reported by the end of last month, according to the state Department of Health. Although that’s an improvement compared to the past few years, the number remains high compared to cases before 2020.
Syphilis is a bacterial infection most often spread through sex that can be cured, but can cause serious health problems without treatment and can be spread from mothers to unborn babies.
How the state, tribes and federal government are working to curb SD’s syphilis epidemic

Syphilis was close to being eradicated in the United States in the 1990s, but cases in South Dakota were increasing in the years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Syphilis infections nationwide climbed rapidly in recent years, reaching a 70-year high in 2022, according to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A majority of cases in South Dakota are among Native Americans. While the highest number of cases so far this year is in Pennington County, where Rapid City is located, the highest rates are in counties that include tribal lands, such as Buffalo, Dewey and Oglala Lakota counties.
There was a time not too many years ago when there were hardly any reported cases, said Meghan Curry O’Connell, chief public health officer at the Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board in Rapid City.
“We still have lots of work to do,” she said.
Tribal and state entities have partnered in the last few years to address the situation. Some tribal health care systems send nurses to find and treat patients in the Rapid City area and on reservations. The state Department of Health launched its Wellness on Wheels program last year as well. The program provides a mobile health care unit for rural communities, including STI testing, treatment, education, counseling and referrals to community resources.
Curry O’Connell said the work has had an impact on syphilis cases.
“They’re coming down, but we’re not where they need to be yet,” she said. “We’ll just have to continue working to contain the outbreak, treat people, and get the rates back to where they were.”
The disease can potentially persist for decades if untreated, which can lead to death. During pregnancy, it poses a dangerous risk to the baby; congenital syphilis can cause bone deformities, severe anemia, jaundice, meningitis and even death.
The state had the highest rate of congenital syphilis in the country in 2023 with 54 cases, which was 482.1 cases per 100,000 births. Congenital syphilis cases are below that pace this year but remain higher than 2020, with eight cases reported so far. 
While efforts to address syphilis among adults as a whole have yielded results, efforts to screen pregnant women have been less successful. That’s because some women are not receiving prenatal care, Curry O’Connell said, which means they aren’t getting screened and monitored leading up to birth.
Curry O’Connell said she worries potential cuts to Medicaid by Congress and the Trump administration will worsen access to maternal care in the state, which could affect work to screen and catch syphilis.

The National Institutes of Health’s sweeping cuts of grants that fund scientific research are inflicting pain almost universally across the U.S., including in most states that backed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
A KFF Health News analysis underscores that the terminations are sparing no part of the country, politically or geographically. About 40% of organizations whose grants the NIH cut in its first month of slashing, which started Feb. 28, are in states Trump won in November.
The Trump administration has singled out Ivy League universities including Columbia and Harvard for broad federal funding cuts. But the spending reductions at the NIH, the nation’s foremost source of funding for biomedical research, go much further: Of about 220 organizations that had grants terminated, at least 94 were public universities, including flagship state schools in places such as Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Nebraska and Texas.
The Trump administration has canceled hundreds of grants supporting research on topics such as vaccination; diversity, equity, and inclusion; and the health of LGBTQ+ populations. Some of the terminations are a result of Trump’s executive orders to abandon federal work on diversity and equity issues. Others followed the Senate confirmation of anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH. Many mirror the ambitions laid out in Project 2025’s “Mandate for Leadership,” the conservative playbook for Trump’s second term.
Affected researchers say Trump administration officials are taking a cudgel to efforts to improve the lives of people who often experience worse health outcomes — ignoring a scientific reality that diseases and other conditions do not affect all Americans equally.
KFF Health News found that the NIH terminated about 780 grants or parts of grants between Feb. 28 and March 28, based on documents published by the Department of Health and Human Services and a list maintained by academic researchers. Some grants were canceled in full, while in other cases, only supplements — extra funding related to the main grant, usually for a shorter-term, related project — were terminated.
Among U.S. recipients, 96 of the institutions that lost grants in the first month are in politically conservative states including Florida, Ohio, and Indiana, where Republicans control the state government or voters reliably support the GOP in presidential campaigns, or in purple states such as North Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania that were presidential battleground states. An additional 124 institutions are in blue states.
Sybil Hosek, a research professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago, helps run a network that focuses on improving care for people 13 to 24 years old who are living with or at risk for HIV. The NIH awarded Florida State University $73 million to lead the HIV project.
“We never thought they would destroy an entire network dedicated to young Americans,” said Hosek, one of the principal investigators of the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. The termination “doesn’t make sense to us.”
NIH official Michelle Bulls is director of the Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration, which oversees grants policy and compliance across NIH institutes. In terminating the grant March 21, Bulls wrote that research “based primarily on artificial and nonscientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
Adolescents and young adults ages 13 to 24 accounted for 1 in 5 new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2022, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It’s science in its highest form,” said Lisa Hightow-Weidman, a professor at Florida State University who co-leads the network. “I don’t think we can make America healthy again if we leave youth behind.”
HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an emailed statement that “NIH is taking action to terminate research funding that is not aligned with NIH and HHS priorities.” The NIH and the White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.
“As we begin to Make America Healthy Again, it’s important to prioritize research that directly affects the health of Americans. We will leave no stone unturned in identifying the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic as part of our mission to Make America Healthy Again,” Hilliard said.
  Harm to HIV, Vaccine Studies 

The NIH, with its nearly $48 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world, awarding nearly 59,000 grants in the 2023 fiscal year. The Trump administration has upended funding for projects that were already underway, stymied money for new applications, and sought to reduce how much recipients can spend on overhead expenses.
Those changes — plus the firing of 1,200 agency employees as part of mass layoffs across the government — are alarming scientists and NIH workers, who warn that they will undermine progress in combating diseases and other threats to the nation’s public health. On April 2, the American Public Health Association, Ibis Reproductive Health, and affected researchers, among others, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the NIH and HHS to halt the grant cancellations.
Two National Cancer Institute employees, who were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation, said its staff receives batches of grants to terminate almost daily. On Feb. 27, the cancer institute had more than 10,800 active projects, the highest share of the NIH’s roughly two dozen institutes and centers, according to the NIH’s website. At least 47 grants that NCI awarded were terminated in the first month.
Kennedy has said the NIH should take a years-long pause from funding infectious disease research. In November 2023, he told an anti-vaccine group, “I’m gonna say to NIH scientists, ‘God bless you all. Thank you for public service. We’re going to give infectious disease a break for about eight years,’” according to NBC News.
For years, Kennedy has peddled falsehoods about vaccines — including that “no vaccine” is “safe and effective,” and that “there are other studies out there” showing a connection between vaccines and autism, a link that has repeatedly been debunked — and claimed falsely that HIV is not the only cause of AIDS.
KFF Health News found that grants in blue states were disproportionately affected, making up roughly two-thirds of terminated grants, many of them at Columbia University. The university had more grants terminated than all organizations in politically red states combined. On April 4, Democratic attorneys general in 16 states sued HHS and the NIH to block the agency from canceling funds.
Researchers whose funding was stripped said they stopped clinical trials and other work on improving care for people with HIV, reducing vaping and smoking rates among LGBTQ+ teens and young adults, and increasing vaccination rates for young children. NIH grants routinely span several years.
For example, Hosek said that when the youth HIV/AIDS network’s funding was terminated, she and her colleagues were preparing to launch a clinical trial examining whether a particular antibiotic that is effective for men to prevent sexually transmitted infections would also work for women.
“This is a critically important health initiative focused on young women in the United States,” she said. “Without that study, women don’t have access to something that men have.”
Other scientists said they were testing how to improve health outcomes among newborns in rural areas with genetic abnormalities, or researching how to improve flu vaccination rates among Black children, who are more likely to be hospitalized and die from the virus than non-Hispanic white children.
“It’s important for people to know that — if, you know, they are wondering if this is just a waste of time and money. No, no. It was a beautiful and rare thing that we did,” said Joshua Williams, a pediatric primary care doctor at Denver Health in Colorado who was researching whether sharing stories about harm experienced due to vaccine-preventable diseases — from missed birthdays to hospitalizations and job loss — might inspire caregivers to get their children vaccinated against the flu.
He and his colleagues had recruited 200 families, assembled a community advisory board to understand which vaccinations were top priorities, created short videos with people who had experienced vaccine-preventable illness, and texted those videos to half of the caregivers participating in the study.
They were just about to crack open the medical records and see if it had worked: Were the group who received the videos more likely to follow through on vaccinations for their children? That’s when he got the notice from the NIH.
“It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment,” the notice read.
Williams said the work was already having an impact as other institutions were using the idea to start projects related to cancer and dialysis.
  A Hit to Rural Health 

Congress previously tried to ensure that NIH grants also went to states that historically have had less success obtaining biomedical research funding from the government. Now those places aren’t immune to the NIH’s terminations.
Sophia Newcomer, an associate professor of public health at the University of Montana, said she had 18 months of work left on a study examining undervaccination among infants, which means they were late in receiving recommended childhood vaccines or didn’t receive the vaccines at all. Newcomer had been analyzing 10 years of CDC data about children’s vaccinations and had already found that most U.S. infants from 0 to 19 months old were not adequately vaccinated.
Her grant was terminated March 10, with the NIH letter stating the project “no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a phrase replicated in other termination letters KFF Health News has reviewed.
“States like Montana don’t get a lot of funding for health research, and health researchers in rural areas of the country are working on solutions to improve rural health care,” Newcomer said. “And so cuts like this really have an impact on the work we’re able to do.”
Montana is one of 23 states, along with Puerto Rico, that are eligible for the NIH’s Institutional Development Award program, meant to bolster NIH funding in states that historically have received less investment. Congress established the program in 1993.
The NIH’s grant terminations hit institutions in 15 of those states, more than half that qualify, plus Puerto Rico.
  Researchers Can’t ‘Just Do It Again Later’ 

The NIH’s research funds are deeply entrenched in the U.S. health care system and academia. Rarely does an awarded grant stay within the four walls of a university that received it. One grant’s money is divvied up among other universities, hospitals, community nonprofits, and other government agencies, researchers said.
Erin Kahle, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, said she was working with Emory University in Georgia and the CDC as part of her study. She was researching the impact of intimate partner violence on HIV treatment among men living with the virus. “They are relying on our funds, too,” she said.
Kahle said her top priority was to ethically and safely wind down her nationwide study, which included 418 people, half of whom were still participating when her grant was terminated in late March. Kahle said that includes providing resources to participants for whom sharing experiences of intimate partner violence may cause trauma or mental health distress.
Rachel Hess, the co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Institute at the University of Utah, said the University of Nevada-Reno and Intermountain Health, one of the largest hospital systems in the West, had received funds from a $38 million grant that was awarded to the University of Utah and was terminated March 12.
The institute, which aims to make scientific research more efficient to speed up the availability of treatments for patients, supported more than 5,000 projects last year, including 550 clinical trials with 7,000 participants. Hess said that, for example, the institute was helping design a multisite study involving people who have had heart attacks to figure out the ideal mix of medications “to keep them alive” before they get to the hospital, a challenge that’s more acute in rural communities.
After pushback from the university — the institute’s projects included work to reduce health care disparities between rural and urban areas — the NIH restored its grant March 29.
Among the people the Utah center thanked in its announcement about the reversal were the state’s congressional delegation, which consists entirely of Republican lawmakers.
“We are grateful to University of Utah leadership, the University of Utah Board of Trustees, our legislative delegation, and the Utah community for their support,” it said.
Hilliard, of HHS, said that “some grants have been reinstated following the appeals process, and the agency will continue to carry out the remaining appeals as planned to determine their alignment.” She declined to say how many had been reinstated, or why the University of Utah grant was among them.
Other researchers haven’t had the same luck. Kahle, in Michigan, said projects like hers can take a dozen years from start to finish — applying for and receiving NIH funds, conducting the research, and completing follow-up work.
“Even if there are changes in the next administration, we’re looking at at least a decade of setting back the research,” Kahle said. “It’s not as easy as like, ‘OK, we’ll just do it again later.’ It doesn’t really work that way.”
  Methodology 

KFF Health News analyzed National Institutes of Health grant data to determine the states and organizations most affected by the Trump administration’s cuts.
We tallied the number of terminated NIH grants using two sources: a Department of Health and Human Services list of terminated grants published April 4; and a crowdsourced list maintained by Noam Ross of rOpenSci and Scott Delaney of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, as of April 8. We focused on the first month of terminations: from Feb. 28 to March 28. We found that 780 awards were terminated in total, with 770 of them going to recipients based in U.S. states and two to recipients in Puerto Rico.
The analysis does not account for potential grant reinstatements, which we know happened in at least one instance.
Additional information on the recipients, such as location and business type, came from the USAspending.gov Award Data Archive.
There were 222 U.S. recipients in total. At least 94 of them were public higher education institutions. Forty-one percent of organizations that had NIH grants cut in the first month were in states that President Donald Trump won in the 2024 election.
Some recipients, including the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Vanderbilt University Medical Center, are medical facilities associated with higher education institutions. We classified these as hospitals/medical centers.
We also wanted to see whether the grant cuts affected states across the political spectrum. We generally classified states as blue if Democrats control the state government or Democratic candidates won them in the last three presidential elections, and red if they followed this pattern but for Republicans. Purple states are generally presidential battleground states or those where voters regularly split their support between the two parties: Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The result was 25 red states, 17 blue states, and eight purple states. The District of Columbia was also blue.
We found that, of affected U.S. institutions, 96 were in red or purple states and 124 were in blue states.

(Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington residents will soon face heftier fines for littering and higher prices for plastic grocery bags.
A new law signed by Gov. Bob Ferguson on Saturday toughens the punishment for littering and delays requirements for retailers to offer thicker bags for sale from Jan. 1, 2026 until 2028. 
The Legislature will use the two years to review the state’s reusable bag policies, Ferguson said. Retailers who sell thicker bags before the mandate is in effect will be penalized four cents a bag, under the new law.
“We’re called the Evergreen State and is it really evergreen with all the litter?” said Rep. Mark Klicker, R-Walla Walla, sponsor of House Bill 1293. “Our freeways, our interstates, are just packed with litter, it’s horrible.” 
The state’s low fines could be a reason why “people don’t really care” about littering, Klicker said, noting Oregon has a higher penalty for littering. Washington’s new law raises the penalty from a class three to a class two civil infraction. 
The fine will increase from $103 to $256, which includes all state mandated charges, according to legislative staff. The fine would apply to amounts up to one cubic foot, or roughly the size of a backpack. The new law will take effect in late July.
Over the past five years, the number of Washington State Patrol encounters with suspected litterers decreased from 636 in 2019 to 258 in 2024. Most of those resulted in verbal warnings rather than citations, according to state patrol data.
While the state patrol tallied fewer contacts, the amount of litter has not decreased, Klicker said. He originally wanted a task force to study possible ways to better deal with the problem but that part was removed. 
The Senate added language to delay the date when retail establishments would be required to provide thicker, reusable plastic bags to customers.
“Increasing the thickness of the bag isn’t going to help people keep the bags,” Klicker said. “They’ll throw the bags away anyway, so it creates that much more litter into the landfills.”
In 2020, the state passed a law banning single-use plastic bags and required retail establishments to offer paper bags or thicker, reusable plastic bags for sale to consumers.
Reusable plastic bags are currently sold for eight cents and required to be a thickness of 2.25 mils. One mil is a unit of thickness equal to one-thousandth of an inch. The 2020 law increased the price to 12 cents and the thickness to four mils on Jan. 1 2026. But the Senate delayed the change in thickness by two years.
Retailers who sell reusable plastic bags with a thickness of at least four mils before 2028 will be penalized four cents a bag. Customers will see a total charge of 16 cents for each bag on their receipts.
The four cent penalty will be deposited in the Waste Reduction, Recycling, and Litter Control Account to address the negative impacts of litter which will go away in 2028.
The price for paper bags will remain at eight cents per bag.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_0166-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-18 09:00:40.872257

They are parents of two Rutland City School District students.It is not an exaggeration to say that our education system is under severe stress. We believe our teachers are the most important component of this system and are essential to the success of our schools and students.We see the increasing demands on the teaching profession locally and throughout the United States. Support from the federal, state and local levels is not keeping pace with ever-increasing demands and does not demonstrate the respect for teachers that their work deserves.As the current presidential administration makes drastic changes to education funding, we need to continue to advocate for and protect our students by allocating funding to the places where it is most effective for student learning. Despite what is happening federally, we still have power at the state and local levels to influence how funding is used.Most decisions about education are made locally by school boards, superintendents and state boards. Our school board has authority over what gets taught (or not), how students are supported and how money is spent with direct input from community members like us. We believe our greatest educational asset is our teachers.READ MORE
Today we ask: Why don’t we pay our teachers more? Is it because we can’t or because we simply don’t? When we do spend on education, is it on things that actually benefit student learning? Are we just telling our teachers we value them or using our resources to show them? How can we as community members influence change in these areas?As community members and parents, we want our tax dollars spent first and foremost on helping our children learn and ensuring that skilled teachers are attracted to and remain in the Rutland City School District.Today we ask the board for better pay for our teachers, a salary reflective of who they are as educated, highly trained and dedicated professionals. We implore community members to ask important questions and tell our elected leaders we want our tax dollars spent in ways that ensure our teachers know our community values them and prioritizes learning for all students.When we respect and support teachers, we support our children’s future.

The work of building and maintaining infrastructure is no longer just brute force labor — it’s technical, creative and increasingly reliant on sophisticated technologies.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov. John Rodgers: Building opportunities for our youth and businesses.","This commentary is by John Rodgers. He is the lieutenant governor of Vermont and continues to operate the family farm, his 35-year-old masonry business, his excavating business and a plowing business.Being a lifelong tradesman — stone mason and excavator, specifically — and now lieutenant governor, I feel obligated to utilize the resources of my office to encourage young (and disillusioned mid-career) Vermonters to embrace the opportunities available to them through the trades so that they may, too, experience success and fulfillment. At the same time, I know the state, as a whole, has an opportunity to collaborate with businesses to expand apprenticeships. A net positive for both working Vermonters and Vermont business. It’s a mission I am embracing with the help of my friends Christine Frost at Courtland Construction and Lisa Durocher at the Northwest Career and Technical Center. I invite you to join us.Vermont’s infrastructure — our roads, bridges, water systems, and stormwater control — is the backbone of our communities and economy. As our state struggles with aging public infrastructure, the need for timely repair, replacement and innovation has never been more urgent — to make no mention of the shortage of housing. Yet behind the shovels and backhoes is a crisis: the shrinking pipeline of skilled workers able to operate heavy equipment. The work of building and maintaining infrastructure is no longer just brute force labor — it’s technical, creative and increasingly reliant on sophisticated technologies. GPS-enabled machines, digital tablets, wireless communication tools and precision controls are now standard on modern heavy equipment. Today’s equipment operators need to be tech-savvy, safety-minded problem-solvers with strong communication skills and spatial awareness. This reality creates a promising opportunity for high school students, especially digital natives who already thrive in technology-rich environments. Careers in heavy civil industries can offer excellent pay, long-term stability and the satisfaction of building lasting public works. Yet, despite these benefits, students are rarely exposed to this pathway early enough to pursue it. Career and Technical Education centers have a crucial role to play. These programs provide hands-on experience, industry-aligned training and a direct pipeline to jobs that are vital to our economy. In Vermont, CTE’s effectiveness is undeniable.As of June 2024, 64.9% of CTE students graduated with an industry-recognized credential, and 46% earned college credit — up from about 20% a few years ago. These gains highlight the system’s adaptability and responsiveness, largely due to support from federal initiatives like the Perkins V grant. However, the limitations are real and growing. The high cost of launching heavy equipment programs, from acquiring machinery to building simulation labs, places a major strain on already limited budgets.Meanwhile, recruiting instructors who bring real-world experience into the classroom is an uphill battle. Industry professionals earn significantly more in the private sector than CTE centers can offer. Without these qualified instructors, we lose the bridge between students and meaningful career opportunities. This workforce shortage isn’t a distant threat, it’s a present-day reality. Without sustained investment in CTE infrastructure, staffing, and programming, we are not only failing our students, we are also jeopardizing our future infrastructure.Communities depend on people who know how to safely and efficiently operate the machines that build our roads, lay our sewer lines, build and renovate our homes, and maintain our bridges. If we don’t act now, we risk an even greater shortage in the years to come. The solution is within reach. Strategic public investment, industry partnerships and creative solutions to recruiting educators and acquiring training equipment can make a powerful difference. With the right support, we can build the workforce we need to meet the current and future infrastructure demands.When you grow up milking cows, banging nails and running — and fixing — equipment, your formative years on a Vermont farm are where you receive your CTE. And while the Vermont of today is different from that of my youth, there will always be a need for the Vermont work ethic and “get-er done” spirit. Our young people deserve the opportunities I had, and our businesses and communities need our young people. Please join us in investing in our state and young people by supporting career and technical education.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lt. Gov.

Tom Lee, Tampa Bay Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez, and lobbyist Ron Pierce at the Tampa Tiger Bay Club in Ybor City on May 16, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Florida voters amended the state Constitution subjecting legislators to eight-year term limits more than three decades ago. But as this year’s legislative session continues with no end in sight, the issue of whether term-limits are working for all Floridians was the topic of debate at the Tampa Tiger Bay Club on Friday afternoon.
“I’ve seen a lot happen,” said Tampa Bay area Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, the longest-serving member of the Legislature, who was first elected to the House in 2008. “The downside is the experts become the staff, and to some extent, the lobbyists, and to a larger extent, not so much the legislator … so I think it has its drawbacks.”
“Term limits have completely empowered lobbyists,” agreed Ron Pierce, a lobbyist himself who worked for eight years as a legislative staffer and has headed RSA Consulting Group since 2009.
The term-limit law became an issue earlier this year when Brevard County House Republican Debbie Mayfield filed to run for the Senate seat in which she had served from 2016-2024.
After she was term-limited from running again last fall, she instead ran and won a seat in the Florida House. But after the newly elected senator in District 19, Randy Fine, quit to run for and win a seat in Congress, Mayfield filed to run for that Senate seat again in a special election.
The Florida Division of Elections ruled that she couldn’t run again for the seat because of the term limit law. She challenged that ruling, and the Florida Supreme Court ruled for her unanimously in February, stating that her gap in serving in the Senate from November until February allowed her to run again for the Senate seat in a special election (which is slated to take place on June 10).
Concurrent to that drama, Hernando County Republican Blaise Ingoglia filed a resolution during the session (SJR 536) that would have clarified that the law imposes a lifetime limit of 16 years in state legislative office — 8 years max in the House, 8 years max in the Senate — with a caveat for senators who serve reduced two-year terms due to redistricting.
The measure would have gone to the voters as a constitutional amendment in 2026, but stalled after being approved in one committee stop.
“Let’s stop the practice of people continually running for the same office and bouncing back and forth between chambers,” Ingoglia said on X. “Serving the people of Florida should be a privilege, and an honor, not a career.”
Voter-imposed
The “Eight is Enough” constitutional amendment in 1992, which passed with 77% of the vote, did not just include eight-year term limits for the state Legislature, but also for members of Congress, former Hillsborough County Republican state Sen. Tom Lee noted on Friday.
“That was the primary motivation behind it, and term limits for Congress was ultimately ruled to be unconstitutional,” he noted.
Former Tampa Democratic Sen. Janet Cruz, who served in the Legislature for more than a decade before losing a bid for re-election to the Senate in 2022, asked the panelists whether term limits even matter anymore because of “gerrymandered districts.”
Pierce insisted they absolutely do matter, citing the fact that when Rouson does leave the Senate next year because of term limits, his successor will not be nearly as experienced or have the same amount of influence.
“It has been around forever and isn’t going away,” Lee said regarding the issue of gerrymandering.
He added that the way that Republicans gained more seats in the Legislature starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s was because they built a coalition with Black and Hispanic Democrats to carve out seats “to ensure their election in minority-access districts in exchange for the rest of the map looking very Republican. And before you knew it, you had a Republican-dominated Legislature. That’s what happened.”
‘Who’s going to pay for that?’
Hillsborough County Property Appraiser Bob Henriquez, a Democrat, served in the Florida House from 1998 until 2006, when he was term-limited from his seat. He said he could make the argument that the state would be better off if term-limits could be extended to 12 or even 16 years, but it would be “controversial” for any lawmaker to push for that proposal.
“There have been efforts to try increase term limits to a different number. I don’t know what that sweet spot is — 12 years, 16 years. None of those have gone very far within the state Legislature,” Henriquez said.
Pierce said he could support getting rid of term limits outright, but added that there’s no way that could possibly happen, since it would require getting them repealed via a constitutional amendment.
“You’ve changed some things in Tallahassee this year, I think, that made it a little more difficult for citizen’s initiatives in the future, that’s number one,” he said, referring to the legislation signed by Gov. DeSantis that will make the process more difficult to get a measure on the ballot.
The second problem, he said, is that it would look “self-serving” for lawmakers to push the measure. But he added that the biggest hurdle would be finding anyone to educate the public about why term-limits should be repealed. “Who in the world is going to try to educate the public on why you’re trying to change term-limits?” he asked. “Who’s going to pay for that?”
The discussion took place just days after Gov. Ron DeSantis travelled to Ohio to give his support for a resolution in that state’s Legislature to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot calling for a constitutional convention to impose congressional term limits. The Florida Legislature passed a resolution last year calling for a U.S. Term Limits convention.

71 years after Brown -- and 50 years after the beginning of Boston busing -- Massachusetts schools remain deeply segregated by race and class. 
The post 71 years later, Massachusetts must deliver on the promise of Brown vs. Board of Education  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN MY Complexities of Urban Schooling class at Clark University, I have spent the last five years teaching future educators about the challenges and opportunities of US public schools, past and present.  The course is at the intersection of education, history, geography, political science, and sociology, using a mix of primary source historical documents, research studies, policy briefs, documentaries, and even TED Talks to frame our discussions and the student-led solutions to some of the most pressing challenges. A favorite TED Talk of mine in this class is one by Kandice Sumner, a fellow Massachusetts educator. Sumner grew up in Boston and was enrolled in METCO, a voluntary school integration program that sends Boston and Springfield students to suburban schools. In the TED Talk, Sumner discusses how her own METCO experience informed her approach as a teacher in Boston schools, and how, even with that integration program, many of her students faced the same segregated classrooms that she escaped. “Teaching my kids about desegregation, the Little Rock Nine, the Civil Rights Movement,” she says in the TED Talk, ”is a real awkward moment in my classroom, when I have to hear the voice of a child ask, ‘If schools were desegregated in 1954, how come there are no white kids here?’’” I can always count on an audible reaction from my students to that moment in her talk. And that jaw dropping line sums up so much about where we stand today—71 years to the week after the Supreme Court famously declared, in Brown vs. Board of Education, that “in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.”  While talk of school segregation from that period often conjures images of the American South, we know too well from Boston’s ignoble history that the stain of school segregation was present in communities throughout the country.  The bad news is that 71 years after Brown — and 50 years after the beginning of Boston busing — Massachusetts schools remain deeply segregated by race and class. The good news is that together, we can transform our schools and classrooms into the dynamic, diverse, and well-resourced learning spaces that our kids and communities deserve. I began my own teaching career about 20 years ago at the Edwards Middle School in Charlestown, the school that Boston’s former acting mayor, Kim Janey, was bused to in the 1970s.  That chapter of our story is only part of the unique and storied history of the fight in Massachusetts for excellent and equitable schools for all kids. While it has been 71 years since Brown, we actually mark 170 years in Massachusetts this year since the legal abolition of segregated schools, in 1855, the result of lawsuits and public protest led by Black families in Boston. In an 1848 letter from the first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education, Horace Mann lays out the most lofty and aspirational goals for our then fledgling school system. “Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin,” he wrote, “is the great equalizer of the conditions of men — the balance-wheel of the social machinery.” Today we continue to strive toward Mann’s vision and Brown’s promise, schools that are the bedrock of community, opportunity, and the future we want for our children. The imperative is not only a matter of economic and racial equity, but of our shared democratic future. As the Supreme Court majority asserted of this integrated and equitable education in the Brown decision, “It is the very foundation of good citizenship.” Indeed, studies suggest that integrated schools prepare students to engage in democratic processes and increase civic participation. Despite that critical need, more than 225,000 students attend racially segregated non-white schools in the state, and Massachusetts public schools are among the most racially and economically segregated in the country.  According to data from The Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University, Massachusetts public schools are the sixth most segregated by income in the country, and only New Jersey has higher levels of economic segregation between school districts.  Students of color are disproportionately hurt by these trends: the average Black or Hispanic student’s school serves almost 30 percentage points more students experiencing poverty than the average white student’s school. The consequences are real, and visible in graduation rates, student disengagement, and college matriculation. We know it doesn’t need to be this way. In fact, we know that most of us here in Massachusetts don’t want it to be this way.  Two years ago, Brown’s Promise, a national nonprofit, was launched to combat school segregation in the US. This week, the first state chapter of Brown’s Promise is opening here in Massachusetts – a place with a rich history, both for better and worse, in the fight to ensure quality education for all. Our mission is to turn the vision of integrated, fully funded schools into a reality for all students, regardless of background.  My colleagues at Brown’s Promise have already been talking to many people in community gatherings across the state, and the results are clear. Families, educators, students, and advocates across Massachusetts agree that every child deserves the same opportunity to thrive regardless of race, income, or zip code.  In recent Springfield, Holyoke, and Lynn community engagement sessions, participants consistently expressed interest in understanding and addressing how segregation, district lines, and funding policies undermine educational quality. We will continue those community conversations and work with partners to analyze policy options to figure out what changes make the most sense in Massachusetts. We know that every community is different and will require different approaches. To help guide this work, Brown’s Promise has outlined five policy solutions already: Fund public schools fully and fairly Rethink school district lines  Ensure integration within districts  Center positive student experiences Cultivate a supportive policy ecosystem I am excited to work with policy leaders, students, and educators to make these things concrete in Massachusetts, and am learning already from the conversations that have already happened in communities across the Commonwealth. For example, families and students in early conversations have been particularly interested in the creation of a series of regional, themed magnet schools that enroll students across district lines without any admissions tests, with free transportation, and with a lottery that ensures socioeconomic diversity.  Massachusetts ranked No. 1 on the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, leading the nation in public education outcomes, but those of us on the ground in our communities know that this does not tell the whole story.  I saw firsthand as a youth worker years ago in Boston, Lowell, Holyoke, and Worcester the ways in which that top-ranked education is out of reach for many of our students of color and/or low-income students. We know that together we can build schools for every child to thrive. Together, we can add our own chapter to the storied history of Massachusetts’ educational leadership for all.  Today, as a parent of a Worcester Public School student and a longtime educator, I am excited to continue these conversations in cities and towns across the Commonwealth to build a shared vision of equitable and excellent schools for all of our kids. Together, we can deliver on Brown’s promise, and ensure that our kids get the integrated and equitable schools that every kid deserves.  Cara Berg Powers is Massachusetts state director for Brown’s Promise, a nonprofit organization advocating for integrated, well-resourced public schools.

With the latest federal court ruling, this is our state's reality once again.","The slow, steady increase in Black Mississippians being elected to public office is the direct result of actions of the federal government — the executive, legislative and most importantly the judiciary — and not because of actions of the state.
State officials have fought almost every effort of federal officials to expand voting rights for people of color and to increase the number of Black Mississippians holding public office. In the 1800s, the white political leadership crafted a state constitution, rooted in white supremacy and designed to block Black Mississippians from having or obtaining political power. Those Jim Crow efforts, well documented over the years, ranged from poll taxes to literacy tests and more. In the 1960s, laws were passed in Mississippi allowing potential voters to be disqualified based on their “character.”
Those efforts have continued to the modern day with efforts of white leaders to gerrymander political districts to weaken the political influence of Black Mississippians. And sometimes, those efforts have included reluctance and even outright refusal of white power brokers to remove some of those Jim Crow provisions.
The latest response from the federal courts to these continued decisions by the state’s white leaders is a recent ruling that forces the creation of three more Black-majority legislative seats: two in the Senate and one in the House.
As a result of that ruling, later this year candidates in 14 legislative districts (five in the House and nine in the Senate) will have to run in special elections.
Creating the three new Black-majority districts required the redrawing of multiple districts — 14 in this case — around the areas where the new districts were created.
It should not be a surprise that most if not all of those lawmakers are not happy that they are being forced to run for reelection in the middle of their four-year term. But this reality is the result of the Mississippi House and Senate leaders approving a redistricting plan that the federal courts found did not provide adequate representation for Black Mississippians.
The requirement forcing legislators to run in special elections is not unprecedented. In 1991, the Legislature passed a redistricting plan that was supposedly based on population shifts found in the 1990 Census. But the U.S. Department of Justice claimed, and the federal courts agreed, that the redistricting plan did not create enough Black-majority districts based on the population of the state.
After considerable legal maneuvering, the House and Senate created a legislative redistricting plan that the federal courts found did not dilute Black voter strength.
The federal courts ordered that all 174 House and Senate members run in a special election in 1992 under those newly drawn, racially fairer districts only a year after they had won election to a new four-year term. Many legislators were not happy about that.
To make matters worse in the mind of those lawmakers, they were having to run a year after passing over the veto of then-Gov. Kirk Fordice a 1-cent increase in the sales tax on retail items. Fordice promised to campaign in the special election against the lawmakers who approved the sales tax increase.
There is little evidence that Fordice was successful in defeating lawmakers because of the tax increase.
But the special election did result in a significant increase in Black representation in the Mississippi Legislature. As a result of that special election, the number of Black members of the 52-member Mississippi Senate increased from four to 10 and increased from 20 to 31 in the 122-member Mississippi House.
Those numbers have slowly but steadily increased since then because of the nature of population shifts and, yes, because of additional federal court actions.
The Black population of Mississippi is currently about 38%, and the Black voting-age population is a little less than that.
Even with these three new Black-majority districts approved recently by the federal courts, there will be 43 Black-majority districts in the House, making up just 35% of the membership in the 122-member chamber. On the other side of the Capitol, there are 16 Black-majority districts, comprising about 31% of the 52-member Senate.
Thanks to action of the federal government — and certainly not the state — the Mississippi Legislature continues to inch closer to a representation that looks like the demographics of Mississippi. But it’s still not there.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/06174816/AP_21239459273852-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-18 07:59:45.564471

The project would have created between 16 and 20 rental units in the community’s century-old town hall while retaining space for town offices.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Let’s get back to work’: Greensboro grapples with vote against affordable housing project.","Two days before Greensboro voted on a contentious proposal to redevelop the town hall into affordable housing, longtime resident and brand-new selectboard member Judy Carpenter wrote a post on Front Porch Forum.“Residents and friends of Greensboro, the big decision is coming,” she said. “No, I don’t mean Tuesday’s vote on the future of the Town Hall. I mean what we all do as community members after that vote.”The housing project saw more than a year of passionate debate, spanning meetings — some organized by the town and others organized by community members themselves — a petition, yard signs, letters, a community website, numerous information sheets and a myriad of internet postings.In the end, residents delivered a clear message, voting 227 to 147 against signing a purchase and sale agreement with non-profit Northeast Kingdom housing agency RuralEdge. However, the small community, which has the highest rate of second home ownership in the state, is left with a dire shortage of housing as well as a divided community.“Greensboro has survived contentious changes in the past—can we do it again?” Carpenter wrote. “No matter what the outcome of this vote is, we have many community projects in need of our efforts. Let’s get back to work.”READ MORE
“You never know until you have an election”The seeds of the town hall redevelopment project were planted around 2019, when both the town plan and a housing needs assessment detailed Greensboro’s “great need” for moderately-priced housing, especially for local employees. According to town documents, the planning commission’s housing committee began a relationship with RuralEdge around that time to develop housing, but had trouble finding a feasible site.In 2022, local non-profit WonderArts decided not to pursue renovating the town hall — a former high school — due to the expense. Town officials turned to the possibility of redeveloping their town hall into rental housing.RuralEdge is proposing to build 20 apartment units at the Greensboro town hall. The units would be spread between the upper floors of the current building and an addition attached to the back of the building. Schematic design courtesy of the Town of Greensboro. RuralEdge Executive Director Patrick Shattuck made an initial presentation of the project at the 2023 Greensboro Town Meeting, and the town signed an option agreement with Rural Edge in May 2023. Somewhere along the way, the project gained opposition, which grew louder and louder.Had the plan been approved, Rural Edge would have bought the building from the town for $500,000 and created between 16 and 20 affordable one- to three-bedroom apartments split between the current town hall and an addition at the back of the structure. The current town offices would have been rented back to the town at operating cost and the Giving Closet, a free community donation space, would have been maintained in perpetuity in approximately half the space.Shattuck said the town hall redevelopment would have been a really impactful project.“One thing that struck me is just the amount of need in Greensboro for housing and people’s willingness to share their personal stories of really being unhoused and the struggles that caused,” he said. “And these are folks who work in the businesses that are so imperative to Greensboro being Greensboro.”Schematic design courtesy of the Town of Greensboro. Shattuck expressed regret that the need won’t be addressed with a project that would have added a significant number of housing units.“It’s sad and frustrating, but you don’t want to force something when it isn’t necessarily the right time and place,” Shattuck said. “Hopefully some of these folks who voiced their concerns, you know, it will mobilize them to continue to work for the change they want to see in their community.”Kent Hansen, current chair of the Greensboro planning commission and a member of the housing subcommittee back when things began in 2019, said last week he was surprised by the outcome of the vote.“I thought that the vote would be closer,” he said. “But you never know until you have an election.”According to Hansen, there were several distinct complaints about the project. One was the scale: A number of people would have felt more comfortable with 8 or 10 units. Another group, he said, thought the town should be holding on to the building and fixing it up for community use.And a third group, he said, was upset with the process, feeling like the selectboard didn’t build up community consensus before signing the initial option agreement with RuralEdge in May 2023.David Kelley, a selectboard member at that time, disagreed with that characterization, stating in an email that there were “plenty of meetings and opportunities to learn” about the project before the option agreement was signed. However, he pointed to another complaint: that the concept of affordable housing “is not fully embraced by significant and influential segments of many communities.”One other struggle the selectboard faced? Rampant misinformation.On Wednesday night, at the first selectboard meeting since the vote, Ellen Celnik — a current selectboard member and an original member of the housing subcommittee — spoke up. She was happy there was a vote and happy the town made a decision, she said.“The one thing that I am truly saddened by is an anonymous mailer that was sent to voters that had an enormous amount of misinformation,” Celnik said. “A part of me, who has worked on this since 2019, really was disappointed with the level of divisiveness that was put out there that was coming from other sources … I hate seeing a small town being hoodwinked by a very small group of people.”At the meeting, the board noted a need to think long-term about the town hall, what it’s used for, and where the money is going to come from to make it useful; the building needs major repairs and the third floor is currently not usable.READ MORE
“It is going to take education, communication and stronger leadership”Looking ahead, Hansen said the planning commission has received a $25,000 municipal planning grant from the state, which they applied for before the vote. The grant aims to help Greensboro build consensus on where they want to grow geographically and what types of housing structures townspeople support.The process is slated to include major public outreach and meetings, an expansion of a survey and several community conversations the commission conducted this past winter. Hansen expects the work to be completed around September.“Hopefully people can pull together,” he said.In the meantime, other smaller housing projects and initiatives are in the works. For one, Shattuck said the very same morning he heard about the results of the vote, he signed a check to fund an accessory dwelling unit in Greensboro. Local businesses have encouraged such units, and a panel discussion about them held last fall in neighboring Craftsbury is thought to have generated at least six such dwellings.The Greensboro Initiative, associated with Central Vermont Habitat for Humanity and whose steering committee is chaired by Hansen, is in the process of constructing a new duplex in Greensboro Bend. The proceeds from the sale of those homes are planned to be reinvested in constructing additional affordable homes.One major local employer, Jasper Hill Farm, continues to take matters into its own hands. Mateo Kehler, co-founder of the artisan cheesemaking business and an outspoken proponent of the town hall redevelopment project, wrote in an email that Japer Hill currently provides housing for employees in eight houses.Kehler said the business recently purchased an additional six housing units (currently occupied by inherited tenants) to support their team, and is in the process of subdividing and selling another house to one of its key employees. Following the vote, he said Jasper Hill is reassessing its ambitions for future growth, particularly in Greensboro.“To make sure our efforts have the most impact, we will be shifting our direct support and investments towards surrounding towns that are more aligned with our mission,” Kehler wrote.Kehler said Jasper Hill also plans to continue its focus on housing by engaging local organizations, including Let’s Build Homes, a pro-housing coalition (Kehler serves on its board), and the Headwaters Community Trust, a community land trust serving Greensboro and three neighboring towns — both of which were launched this year.Kelley, when looking back on the rejected project, noted that Greensboro’s struggle to create affordable housing is not unique. The problem is accelerating across Vermont and the country, he said — and the anger that has fueled recent national and local elections is not going to solve it.“It is going to take education, communication and stronger leadership,” he wrote. “And as a member of our Select Board, I think we failed on those accounts.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘Let’s get back to work’: Greensboro grapples with vote against affordable housing project.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Greensboro-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-18 06:59:05.147097

Photo courtesy Lake Champlain Maritime MuseumNoah Diedrich is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.Those large yellow buoys floating atop Lake Champlain aren’t for monitoring the weather, nor are they for decoration. Instead, they mark the final resting places of centuries-old ships that wrecked on the lakebed.The floats are part of the Underwater Preservation Program, a 40-year-old initiative run by the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum that aims to uphold the federal Abandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987. The act looks to prevent historic wrecks from being disturbed by treasure hunters and salvagers. The museum oversees shipwrecks on Vermont’s side of the lake. “This preserve system is one of the very first in the nation,” said Chris Sabick, the museum’s executive director. “It really is a mechanism for the state to achieve its mandated goals of preservation and access to shipwreck sites.”Vermont’s system, implemented in 1982, has been a model that other states have replicated, Sabick said. The old ways of locating shipwrecks were hazardous to the wrecks themselves — a method the museum wants to avoid.“They would drag their anchor along until it snagged on something, and then they would dive down and see what that was,” Sabick said. “If that happened to be a shipwreck, it might take a piece of the shipwreck with it when you recovered the anchor or when the wind started blowing and pulled the shipwreck apart.”The current system provides a much less invasive technique. The yellow buoys mark the wrecks’ locations, and divers can follow buoys’ lines down to submerged signage identifying each wreck and providing pointers on how to observe without impacting the sites. The wrecks range from steamships to schooners, with most dating back to the early 1800s. A popular wreck is the Burlington Bay Horse Ferry, which is exactly what it sounds like — a horse-powered ferry that sank around 1814. The preserve program, now in its 40th year, is looking to expand access to the shipwrecks for non-divers, Sabick said. One such addition is taking visitors to wreck sites by boat and using remote-operated vehicles to transmit a live feed of the wreck to a TV screen on deck. The museum also created composite 3D models of the wrecks from digital images taken of the sites, which can be viewed on its website from anywhere with an internet connection. A still image from a 3D model of the General Butler, a wrecked schooner in the lake. Photo courtesy Lake Champlain Maritime Museum“It’s just broadening the access to these sites, even for people that aren’t local or aren’t divers,” Sabick said. H.494, a capital bonds bill, would allot $46,000 to the Underwater Preserves Program, an annual appropriation that goes toward site inspections and maintenance. The yearly sum increased from $36,000 in the past few years as the program added two new shipwreck sites. The bill has already passed through the Vermont House and now sits in the Senate. A committee of conference reported on Tuesday that it is recommending the upper house withdraw its recommended amendment .The proposed changes do not affect the allotment to the preserves program. Laura Trieschmann, state historic preservation officer, said the museum has been a tremendous partner that brings life to the wrecks. “They’re not just manning the wrecks with buoys and getting the permits,” she said. “They’re researching the stories of these places so that they’re not just a pile of wood on the bottom of the lake.”About 600 divers visit the wrecks each year, which contributes greatly to the continuation of the preservation program, Trieschmann said. “They’re not going to be around forever,” she said, “(considering) the nature of where they are and mussels and things like that could damage them, as well as boats. We definitely want to showcase them while we can.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Lake Champlain shipwreck program to expand access to non-divers.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/diver-shipwreck-lake-champlain-e-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-18 06:59:05.147097

The order, signed in April, repeals prior federal guidance that encouraged schools to address racial disparities in discipline, arguing that such policies promoted “discriminatory equity ideology” and compromised school safety by pressuring administrators to underreport serious student misconduct.
In some states, new legislation already is trending toward giving teachers more authority to address student misbehavior.
In West Virginia, for example, a new law creates a structured process for responding to violent, threatening or disruptive behavior among students in grades K-6.
Under the law, a student exhibiting such behavior can be immediately removed from class, evaluated by counselors or behavioral specialists and placed on an individualized behavior plan. If there’s no improvement after two rounds of intervention, the student could be moved into a behavioral intervention program or an alternative learning environment.
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, and supporters say the law empowers teachers to maintain safe classrooms.
“This legislation provides teachers with the tools to regain control of the classroom and ensure safe learning environments for our kids,” Morrisey said at the bill’s signing.
In April, the Texas House of Representatives passed a bill referred to as the “Teacher’s Bill of Rights” with a bipartisan vote of 124-20.
That bill, now sitting in the Senate’s education committee, would significantly expand the grounds for out-of-school suspensions, allowing students to be suspended for repeated disruptions or threats beginning in third grade. It would reverse earlier changes that limited suspensions for younger students. It also would mandate that students making terroristic threats or assaulting school employees be placed in alternative education programs for at least 30 days.
Texas civil rights groups argue that the bill would impose a one-size-fits-all punitive approach, rather than addressing students’ developmental and behavioral needs.
Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project and a former teacher, said state lawmakers are taking the wrong approach by mandating sweeping discipline policies for a state as diverse as Texas.













Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development.


– Alycia Castillo, associate director of policy at the Texas Civil Rights Project





During the 2020-21 school year, according to the latest data available from the U.S. Department of Education, Black students faced the highest rates of disciplinary action across all categories — suspension and expulsion — among all racial and ethnic groups.
They were 39% more likely than white students to receive in-school suspensions, 70% more likely to face out-of-school suspensions, and 71% more likely to be expelled.
The disparities were even starker for Black students with disabilities, who experienced suspension and expulsion rates far exceeding those of both their white peers and non-disabled students.
Reviving old, harsh disciplinary policies risks disproportionately harming students of color, students with disabilities and those from low-income backgrounds, Castillo said.
“What works in Austin may not work in West Texas,” Castillo said.
“Children are naturally disruptive — that’s part of their development,” she added. “Excluding them only harms their growth into functional adults.”
 Restorative justice models

In recent years, some other states have passed laws promoting restorative practices in schools, in which students and teachers work through problems and focus on repairing the harm caused by disruptions or conflict.
Michigan’s 2017 law requires schools to consider restorative approaches before suspensions or expulsions, aiming to repair harm rather than exclude students. Nevada began mandating restorative justice approaches in 2019, but scaled back that approach in 2023.
This year, Maryland passed a law requiring the state to establish “restorative practices schools,” specific schools with trained educators who use the approach in everyday discipline.
Kimberly Hellerich, an assistant professor at Sacred Heart University and a former K-12 teacher, said discipline policies should go beyond punitive measures to foster accountability and community healing.
“Adding restorative practices to accompany codes of conduct can allow students to recognize the impact of their actions on themselves, peers, the teacher, the class and the school community,” Hellerich said.
In her own classrooms, Hellerich used what she called “community circles” to guide students in processing behavior, offering apologies and rebuilding trust. “The apology served as a way to restore the student’s relationship with the entire class community,” she said.
 Calls for a cultural shift on expectations

While lawmakers debate discipline procedures, other education advocates warn that an even deeper issue is unfolding inside classrooms: the gradual erosion of behavioral expectations and academic rigor.













Discipline is the backbone of effective learning.


– Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E.





Jessica Bartnick, co-founder and CEO of the Dallas-based mentorship program Foundation for C.H.O.I.C.E., said that declining school discipline and lowered standards are quietly undermining educational outcomes.
“Discipline is the backbone of effective learning,” Bartnick, who supports the Texas legislation, told Stateline in an email. “Without it, classrooms become chaotic, instructional time is lost and teachers are forced to shift their focus from instruction to behavior management.”
Bartnick said efforts to promote equity sometimes inadvertently lower behavioral standards and deprive teachers of the tools they need to maintain safe learning environments.
She also criticized lenient grading policies and unlimited test retakes, arguing that they diminish the value of preparation, responsibility and resilience.
“If students are shielded from the discomfort of failure, they are also shielded from the growth that comes with it,” she wrote. “If we want to prepare students for a world that will not offer endless second chances, we must return to a classroom culture grounded in discipline, responsibility, and rigor.”

But to Simons, the Justice Department’s recent dismissal of a school desegregation order in Louisiana — at a time when racial and socioeconomic isolation continues — is a sign that the current administration has turned its back on students who don’t receive an equal education. It’s why she left the Educational Opportunities Section at the DOJ after 14 years  in April.
“The administration has been very clear that resources are going to be allocated to certain identified priorities,” she said — primarily keeping trans students out of women’s sports and punishing universities it accuses of tolerating anti-semitism. But that agenda, she said, “is leaving a lot of parents and kids with nowhere to turn.”
Now she aims to be part of a solution. She’s lending her expertise to a new initiative intended to give families another way to resolve their concerns — the Public Education Defense Fund.
The National Center for Youth Law, a 50-year-old nonprofit, launched the project on Friday to help families with complaints that the DOJ or the Office for Civil Rights at the Education Department either won’t acknowledge or no longer has the capacity to investigate. Simons will co-chair the fund’s advisory council.
Announced in advance of Saturday’s 71st anniversary of the Brown v. Board decision ending segregation, the effort will include a fellowship program for former OCR attorneys who lost their positions when the Trump administration gutted the agency and closed seven regional offices in March. The goal is to capitalize on the “brain drain” caused by the elimination of nearly 250 OCR staffers and connect families with pro-bono attorneys who can conduct investigations and bring lawsuits to resolve their concerns.
“I have zero confidence in [the department’s] ability to administer the system effectively,” said Johnathan Smith, chief of staff and general counsel at the center. “I think most parents who are looking at what’s happening probably would reach the same conclusion.”

Thousands of Student Civil Rights Cases Left Adrift After Trump Guts Ed Dept

 




As it shifts attention away from discrimination against LGBTQ students and racial minorities, OCR has left thousands of complaints untouched and dismissed many others. Trump’s 2026 budget proposal calls for an additional 35% cut to the office as the administration pushes to eliminate the department.
The center, along with parents and special education advocates, sued the department over the firings, and asked the District of Columbia federal court to immediately reinstate staff. A hearing is set for May 20.
Andy Artz was a supervising attorney in OCR’s New York City office until March 11, when the department placed him and hundreds of other department staffers on leave and locked them out of their computer systems. He was in the middle of helping a student who had been denied access to a senior trip because of multiple disabilities and close to reaching a resolution for a victim of sexual assault by a classmate.
“I found the work really meaningful,” said Artz, who hopes to work with the fund. “OCR was able to do a great job helping school districts and universities understand their obligations.”
To the new administration, however, OCR perpetuated discrimination by focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion and harmed women by extending Title IX protections to transgender students.
“Let me be clear: it is a new day in America,” Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said when the department announced an investigation into a gender-neutral bathroom in Denver schools. “Under President Trump, OCR will not tolerate discrimination of any kind.”
Even if the court blocks the job cuts, it’s unclear whether attorneys would be allowed to return to cases that don’t align with the administration’s priorities. Smith still sees a need for the new project.
His team will work with local NAACP chapters, bar associations and other community organizations to get the word out about the OCR alternative, Smith said.
In addition to seeking attorneys who will represent students pro-bono, the fund hopes to attract some of the talent forced to leave the federal government by offering four- to six-month fellowships. Attorneys will receive a $12,500 stipend and non-attorneys will receive $9,000. Depending on funding, Smith expects up to 10 fellows in the first round.

 ‘Top-performing personnel’

When Trump was inaugurated, OCR had over 12,000 open cases, according to its website. But the database hasn’t been updated since before the new administration took over. According to Julie Hartman, a department spokeswoman, OCR continues to “evaluate all legitimate complaints” and has initiated over 200 disability-related investigations and dozens related to Title IX and anti-discrimination laws.
“OCR’s staff is composed of top-performing personnel with years of experience enforcing federal civil rights laws who work vigorously to protect all Americans’ civil rights,” she said.
She declined to comment on the fund specifically, but said the department “welcomes support from — and has often worked with — outside groups who want to advocate for students and families and help those who believe that their civil rights have been violated.”
Factoring in staff reductions and those who left voluntarily, Artz estimates that only about a third of OCR’s staff remains out of the over 560 attorneys, supervisors and other employees who worked there last fall.

As Trump Shakes Up Oversight of Special Ed, Frustrated DC Parents Want Change

 




As a former deputy assistant attorney general during the Obama administration, Smith doesn’t solely blame Trump for OCR being “terribly backlogged.”
“It was a system that often was a black hole for families,” he said. “What does it mean to have an Office for Civil Rights that’s actually responsive to families and to young people?”
For Callie Oettinger, a Fairfax County, Virginia, parent and special education advocate, getting OCR to act has yielded mixed results. She has seen complaints linger for years as well as recent steps by the new administration to act on disability cases.
OCR still hasn’t completed a probe into her 2019 complaint that the Fairfax district denied transportation to students with disabilities who needed extra time to complete the PSAT. At the same time, she’s noticed an uptick in OCR investigations on more recent issues. Since early April, officials have responded to two complaints she’s involved in, one filed in December and another in March.
“It’s not clear why they’re starting where they’re starting,” she said. “Things are definitely moving forward, but they’re not doing themselves a favor by keeping their website so outdated.”

‘Everybody is Frustrated’: Feds Probe Virginia’s Handling of Special Education

 




Others are looking elsewhere for relief.
In Delaware’s Cape Henlopen School District, Louise Michaud Ngido, an English language teacher, said she’s heard nothing about her complaint that schools have failed to provide English learners with adequate support. Students new to the country, she said, don’t receive specific English development classes and staff members don’t provide translation services or interpreters for parents. The district denied any discrimination.
Under Cardona, OCR opened an investigation last October, but Ngido has heard nothing since. She said she hopes Delaware will be “more proactive” and investigate complaints that OCR won’t.
 Department of Justice priorities

At least one Republican proposal to eliminate the education department would shift OCR’s workload to the DOJ. But the education staff there has always been a fraction of the size of OCR’s. Simon’s former office once had 40 attorneys. Now, she said, it has six.
The agency’s priorities have also changed.
In an interview with the Epoch Times, a conservative media outlet, Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights, said her agenda includes doing “some law enforcement” against hospitals conducting gender-affirming surgeries, elevating parental rights and dismissing school district consent decrees over desegregation.
The DOJ said in a press release that it ended its “probing federal oversight” of integration efforts in Louisiana’s Plaquemines Parish schools because the district was spending “precious local resources” to meet past administration’s demands for data on issues such as hiring and discipline.
In the interview, Dhillon said the department wants to “let people off the hook” if they corrected past discrimination. Consent decrees, in which a district pays a court-appointed monitor for ongoing oversight, are “a powerful tool” and appropriate when there’s been severe corruption or racism, she said. “What’s not appropriate is to maintain these rent-seeking financial arrangements …  beyond their normal life cycle.”
But Simons, the former DOJ section chief, said Black students are still disciplined at higher rates than their white peers and are more likely to attend “crumbling” schools. Research shows that racial and socioeconomic isolation has steadily increased since the 1980s.
“Segregation persists; inequality persists,” she said.
Working with universities to collect and preserve existing data is another one of the fund’s goals. The administration, Smith said, might point to a declining number of OCR complaints as evidence of fewer problems in schools, when, in fact, it’s a byproduct of fewer investigations.
“We want to be able to counter that narrative by showing that just because people aren’t going to OCR doesn’t mean that there aren’t real concerns and real issues of discrimination in our schools,” he said.

 ‘The aid of legal counsel’

Jackie Wernz, a civil rights attorney and consultant who worked at the department during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said it’s important for nonprofits like the center to “step up,” but cautioned that outside efforts have limitations.
“Without a robust federal civil rights arm, civil rights in this country are not going to be enforced,” she said.
States don’t have the same expertise and resources, she said, and it’s unclear who would enforce any changes.
But Smith countered that the bulk of what OCR investigators do is negotiate solutions between families and district staff.
“Having parents and children do that with the aid of legal counsel,” he said, “will yield far better results and outcomes than if they try to navigate those systems on their own.”

Reproductive health advocates are sounding the alarm over the case of a pregnant woman in Georgia who was declared brain dead months ago but must now stay on life support, according to her family, because of the state’s strict abortion ban law.
Adriana Smith, a 30-year-old nurse from the metro Atlanta area, experienced a medical emergency in February that involved blood clots in her brain. Smith, who was about nine weeks pregnant at the time, was declared legally dead, her mother, April Newkirk, told Atlanta TV station 11Alive Action News.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Newkirk said that staff at Emory University’s network of hospitals told her they cannot remove the devices that are helping Smith to breathe because of the state’s six-week abortion ban. The staff said they are legally required to keep Smith breathing until the fetus reaches viability, Newkirk added.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk told the television station of Smith, who also has a 5-year-old son. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.”
The case puts a spotlight on the consequences of restrictive abortion bans following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a federal constitutional right to an abortion. Georgia’s abortion ban has an exception for a pregnancy that threatens the life of the pregnant person. But Smith’s case doesn’t fall under those exceptions, her family said. Since Smith is brain-dead, the pregnancy no longer poses a risk to her life. And because Smith’s fetus still has a heartbeat, the family said that she must still be kept on life support to comply with Georgia’s abortion ban.
Rep. Nikema Williams, an Atlanta-area Democrat, said in a statement Friday that Smith and her family “deserve better.”
“Everyone deserves the freedom to decide what’s best for their families, futures, and lives. Instead, anti-abortion politicians like Donald Trump and Governor Brian Kemp are forcing people through unimaginable pain,” Williams said. “Adriana’s story is gut-wrenching. It’s also a painful reminder of the consequences when politicians refuse to trust us to make our own medical decisions.”

Smith initially sought medical treatment in February for intense headaches, according to her mother. She went to Northside Hospital, where she was given medication and sent home. The following day, at her home, her boyfriend found her gasping for air. Representatives for Northside Hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Smith was then seen by and sent to different doctors throughout the Emory University hospital system, including Emory University Hospital, where she worked as a nurse. A CT scan showed blood clots in her brain. She was subsequently declared brain-dead, which means she is considered legally dead.
Smith is now 21 weeks pregnant. Newkirk said the hospital staff told her they plan to keep her daughter breathing until she is at least 32 weeks pregnant.
Representatives for Emory told the Associated Press that the hospital network could not comment on an individual case because of privacy rules but said in a statement: “Emory Healthcare uses consensus from clinical experts, medical literature, and legal guidance to support our providers as they make individualized treatment recommendations in compliance with Georgia’s abortion laws and all other applicable laws. Our top priorities continue to be the safety and wellbeing of the patients we serve.”
Despite historic indictment, doctors will keep mailing abortion pills across state lines

Alicia Stallworth, director of Georgia campaigns for the reproductive rights advocacy group Reproductive Freedom for All, called Smith’s condition “a devastating tragedy.”
“But what makes it even more unconscionable is that her family has been denied the space and dignity to grieve,” said Stallworth. “Instead of being allowed to say goodbye, they are being forced to endure an agonizing limbo because of the state’s extreme abortion ban. This is not care. This is not justice. It is a cruelty rooted in a system that refuses to see Black women as fully human, even in death.”
Newkirk told 11Alive Action News, Georgia’s NBC affiliate, that the state’s strict abortion laws have robbed her family of the choice about whether to continue Smith’s pregnancy and the ability to make decisions on their own terms. They’re now left in limbo and facing the prospect of paying for several more weeks of expensive medical care.
“I think every woman should have the right to make their own decision,” Newkirk told the station. “And if not, then their partner or their parents.”
Smith’s fetus also has fluid on his brain, Newkirk said, carrying unknown implications for his health and future.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said.
“This decision should’ve been left to us. Now we’re left wondering what kind of life he’ll have — and we’re going to be the ones raising him,” she said.
Members of the House Reproductive Freedom Caucus, co-chaired by Democratic Reps. Diana DeGette of Colorado and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, said in a Friday statement that “there is no desensitizing to the horror of this moment.”
“Adriana’s mother spent Mother’s Day watching her daughter undergo unconscionable medical torture by orders of the state,” they said. “Her young son spent Mother’s Day thinking his mom was just asleep and will soon wake up to hold him again. There are no words that can provide clarity or comfort. There is only the promise that we will say her name until her family sees peace and justice.”
Black women face higher maternal mortality rates in the United States and in Georgia, a public health crisis that has been underscored by the loss of federal abortion rights.
Smith’s case is the latest instance in which Georgia’s six-week abortion ban and its impacts on Black women have made national news. In 2024, the investigative newsroom ProPublica reported on the cases of two other Black women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died of infections after seeking to end their pregnancies in the state. The state’s maternal mortality review committee determined that both deaths were preventable, the outlet reported.
Monica Simpson, the executive director of SisterSong, an Atlanta-based reproductive justice organization focused on women of color, is also the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the state’s six-week abortion ban. In a statement Wednesday, she noted that Smith, a registered nurse, knew how to advocate for herself and navigate the medical system. Still, she didn’t get the treatment she needed until it was too late. Black women, she said, “must be trusted when it comes to our health care decisions.”
“We’ve sounded the alarm for years,” Simpson said. “Yet, after the devastating and preventable deaths of multiple Black women, the message still rings clear: our lives are on the line, and our human right to bodily autonomy has been violated. Our bodies are not battlegrounds for political power plays.”

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/18/ct-budget-battle-looms/,Last week's deal among Gov. Ned Lamont and Democrats solved one problem but sets the stage for budget battles that could continue for years.,"At first glance, last week’s budget brinkmanship between Gov. Ned Lamont and the General Assembly’s Democratic majority was over a mundane issue.
When would Connecticut take $300 million out of its $6.5 billion pile of unused cash to make mandatory Medicaid payments to clinics, social service agencies and other providers that treat the poor?
But beneath this procedural conflict was a much bigger battle over the budget controls that helped generate the state’s $4.1 billion rainy day fund — accumulated largely since Lamont took office in 2019 — and the $2.4 billion surplus projected for this fiscal year.
Lawmakers used loopholes for years to avoid a showdown with the fiscally moderate governor and to spend billions outside of a cap system many complain saves excessively to the detriment of education, health care and other core services.
But the chief loophole, nearly $3 billion in emergency federal COVID grants that could be spent regardless of cap limits, has largely been exhausted. 
And as other workarounds also become problematic, Democrats now refuse to constrain programs — at least not while an eight-year explosion of government reserves continues.
Lamont ended last week’s standoff late Thursday, agreeing to the first exception in 18 years to a spending cap that limits most budget growth to increases in household income or inflation. That will allow lawmakers to authorize $300 million next week for Medicaid payments, even though that action will push this fiscal year’s $26 billion budget marginally over the cap by at least $25 million. 
Had the governor not made this concession, providers were expecting that state payments owed in late May would be pushed back until after July 1, a delay some said would make them unable to cover payroll.
More importantly, the spending cap exception will open the door for Democrats and Lamont to compromise on a new two-year state budget, because roughly $300 million extra also will be appropriated to support the next budget cycle.
But with the governor and minority Republicans still championing these budget controls and many Democrats insisting the extra funding —  though helpful — won’t reverse years of fiscal neglect, last week’s struggle could be the first of several for years to come. The budget controls, which last were set in 2017, are largely fixed by law and contract until July 2028, but still can be adjusted with the governor’s consent.
Ritter: No new budget ‘If you don’t solve this Medicaid puzzle’
“If you don’t solve this Medicaid puzzle,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a mid-morning press conference last Thursday, “I don’t know how it all gets paid for.”
The speaker was referring not just to the latest payments owed providers who treat Connecticut’s poor but to planned investments over the next two years in K-12 education, public colleges and universities, municipal aid, social services, nursing homes and other health care programs.
At first glance, Connecticut has the resources it needs to handle all these challenges.
The state has amassed close to $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017, which represent 8% or more of the General Fund. The $2.4 billion cushion projected for this year represents 10%.
Lawmakers have used these post-2017 windfalls to build what was a tiny $212 million emergency reserve — barely larger than 1% of the budget — to a record-setting $4.1 billion, and to pay down more than $8.5 billion of the massive pension debt Connecticut incurred between 1939 and 2010. The state still owes more than $35 billion. And the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think-tank, last year ranked Connecticut’s per capita pension debt highest in the nation.
Critics, including some Democrats in the legislature, nonetheless say the state has overcompensated for its past poor savings habits, stashing cash too aggressively and weakening services for one generation to fix a debt problem created by three.
A spending cap exception of $300 million cannot offset the billions siphoned out of programs and into reserves and pensions over the last seven years, they add.
“We cannot continue to excuse the sufferings of our communities in order to irresponsibly manage our long-term liabilities,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All, a progressive coalition of faith, labor and other civic groups. 
Critics of the savings programs cite many shortfalls:

Connecticut hasn’t broadly adjusted Medicaid rates for doctors who treat low-income patients since 2007. A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states.


The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities launched an advertising campaign this spring attacking Lamont for allowing the state’s overreliance on property taxes to worsen even as Connecticut’s coffers swell. Communities lose more than $400 million annually because statutory education grants — general aid, special education and funds for charter and magnet schools — haven’t kept pace with inflation, CCM says.


Nonprofit agencies serving clients with intellectual disabilities or struggling with mental illness say state payments effectively are down 30% since 2007 because they haven’t kept pace with inflation, costing providers hundreds of millions of dollars annually. “The safety net is ripping, whether people want to admit it or not,” said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance.


And the state’s largest health care workers union recently set a May 27 strike deadline for about 6,400 caregivers at dozens of nursing and group homes, saying members can earn more serving fast food than they can assisting elderly residents and clients with disabilities.

“Every day there’s something more,” Ritter said, adding that a more comprehensive debate over budget controls is unavoidable in the coming years.
Lamont, GOP still expect Democrats to make hard choices
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said the administration will continue working with legislators, but “the governor’s position has been clear throughout this process: the budget … must adhere to all constitutional and statutory requirements.”
Spending more than the cap permits this fiscal year means legislative leaders must secure not just bare majorities but 60% votes of approval in the House and Senate.
That comes with some political risk to Lamont, who must declare a state budget emergency before the limit can be surpassed — and who has not announced whether he will run for a third term next year.
State officials have legally exceeded the spending cap seven times since it was created in 1991 but not since 2007. That’s when Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell and a Democratic-controlled legislature, with GOP support, appropriated $690 million above the limit to significantly boost municipal aid and payments to doctors and other providers that treat the poor.
But after a severe recession pushed state finances deep into the red and triggered a historic $1.8 billion-plus tax hike in 2011, legally exceeding the cap became politically taboo.
Given the political sensitivity that surrounds the cap, the Lamont administration also has pushed Democrats to be more frugal. But it hasn’t always been successful.
Public colleges and universities’ budgets currently are propped up with roughly $270 million in federal pandemic grants that expire next fiscal year. The Democrat-controlled Appropriations Committee recommended a $55.7 billion two-year budget this spring that replaces much of that vanishing aid with state dollars.
But the Lamont administration notes that public colleges and universities have amassed more than $1 billion in reserves in recent years and should be required to spend some of that massive cushion down before getting more help from the Capitol.
House Republicans note that both the Appropriations Committee and Lamont failed to budget about $230 million requested by the comptroller’s office to cover contractually obligated health benefits for retired state workers over the next two fiscal years combined.
“I think we need to be honest about where we are and where we’re going,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
Connecticut will be hard-pressed to continue prioritizing paying down pension debt if it allows spending to grow quickly as it did for decades prior to 2017, he said.
The House GOP leader added that this past week’s Medicaid billing fight was unnecessary. Democratic legislators and Lamont ignored projections one year ago that showed Medicaid costs were surging, opting not to budget more or trim coverage levels to offset the anticipated demand.
House Republicans also say Connecticut could save tens of millions of dollars annually by ending Medicaid coverage for undocumented adults and children, an idea that Democrats consistently have rejected.
Lamont, GOP also struggle to stay under spending cap
But Democrats counter that Lamont and the GOP have their own struggles when it comes to budget controls.
Lamont, who called the cap “sacrosanct” during a January meeting with state business leaders, needed several gimmicks to keep the two-year spending plan he proposed in February under the limit.
Besides underfunding health care for retired state workers, Lamont also proposed paying for the $60 million-per-year Town Aid Road municipal grant with borrowing, which is spending-cap exempt, rather than including it in the budget. Towns can use TAR funds for capital projects, but many also use them to pay for winter snow plowing — a service not normally financed over many years with interest costs.
And after pledging to bolster Connecticut’s flagging child care industry, the governor recommended creating a $300 million fund outside of the budget and spending cap rules to support new investments in this area for many years to come.
House Republicans recommended a similar shift off-budget to back child care in the biennial plan they proposed earlier this month, while the Senate GOP declined to propose any state budget in this cap-constrained environment.
Democrats add they’ve taken great care to respect Lamont’s top fiscal priorities throughout his tenure, sometimes at the expense of public services.
The governor opposes raising taxes on wealthy households to finance greater state spending or tax relief for the poor or middle class, a position many of his fellow Democrats don’t share. And while the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee has endorsed some wealth-redistribution tax measures during Lamont’s tenure, legislative leaders haven’t included any in the budgets sent to the governor’s desk.
“They want no revenue increases and yet they want us to basically cut all of the things we think are important?” Ritter said. “Good budgets aren’t free. They cost money.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_540-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-18 05:00:52.503172

Usage spikes, not just rates, drive costs up. Eversource encourages energy-saving habits—like adjusting thermostats, using appliances off-peak, and switching to LEDs—to stay cool while managing expenses. Efficiency pro[...]","By Eversource
After a long, cold winter, warmer weather is finally here and many of us have been looking forward to shutting off the heat, packing away the coats, and spending more time outside. We all know how hot Connecticut summers can be, and it’s only a matter of time before the return of those scorching temperatures has us turning on the fans and cranking up the air conditioners again. But even with electric rates dropping this summer, it’s important to remember that when the mercury climbs, energy usage typically does too—and that’s what can cause your bill to spike.
Think of it this way: if you buy more groceries, you’d expect to pay more at checkout. If you drive your car more often than usual, you’d expect to pay more in gasoline. The more you use, the more you pay, and your energy bill is no different, as the most of it is based on usage. In Connecticut, the average residential customer uses about 35% more electricity to keep cool during the summer months. Last year, due to a record-breaking summer with multiple heat waves, that increase was even greater, and customers certainly saw the change reflected in their energy bills.
While the significant increase to the Public Benefits portion of the bill in July 2024 was one of the factors that led to higher bills last summer, usage was the number-one reason for the dramatic surge customers saw. If a homeowner used the exact same amount of energy from June to July last year (approximately 700 kWh on average), their Eversource electric bill would have increased by about $8. Even though Public Benefits increased, and Standard Service (the supply rate Eversource purchased from power generators for customers) decreased substantially at the same time, many of us saw an increase far larger than $8 on our summer bills — because of higher usage.
But those are last year’s numbers. What can you expect this year? There are two rate decreases happening. The first started May 1 with the Public Benefits portion of the bill going down. An average Eversource residential customer saw their total bill decrease by approximately $13.50. Energy supply is also expected to go down starting July 1, but even with those two decreases, you shouldn’t be surprised to see your bill go up this summer because of increased energy usage. 

How much energy you use, and therefore how much your bill total will be, depends on several factors, and weather is a big one. If blistering hot days dominate the summer months, your usage will naturally increase. Even if you keep your thermostat set at the same temperature, on a 90-degree day your system works much harder to keep your home or business cool compared to an 80-degree day, which means your usage has increased. 
This may leave you wondering: is there anything I can do to help keep costs down this summer? The answer is yes. Customers can take advantage of energy efficiency measures and programs because it all adds up and makes a difference for your bottom line. Setting your thermostat one degree higher can mean your air conditioner is using one to three percent less electricity. Turning on your major appliances, like dryers and dishwashers, in the morning or late evening hours means you’re not adding heat to your home during the hottest parts of the day. Switching to LEDs means your lights are running cooler and, as a bonus, last a lot longer than incandescent lights. For the windows that get a lot of sunlight shining in, closing the blinds will also help keep your home cooler. In addition, we offer a variety of energy efficiency programs that can help lower your usage and save money on certain products, as well as financial assistance and payment plans that can help you manage your monthly bills. 
We all want to stay cool during the summer months, but that doesn’t mean you can’t stay on budget too. We hope that by sharing these tips, tools, and information about the many solutions available to our customers, we can help you accomplish both.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)One afternoon not long ago, I walked the south lawn of the state Capitol at Topeka, camera in hand, seeking inspiration. I wasn’t looking for photographic subjects exactly, but something deeper, some sign or cypher that might be a key to hope in the early months of 2025.
Simply put, I was bone tired.
The American carnival of politics had left me numb.
During the five years I’ve written this column, I’ve shared my concern, anxiety, and outrage over state and national politics. I have at times warned of uncharted terrain and at others admitted fear, but now I must convey an existential cultural exhaustion. It is something that reaches down to the personal.
A week or so before driving the 58 miles from my front steps to roam the Capitol lawn, as we got into the Jeep to run some errand, Kim paused and pointed to the roof of our house. A course of shingles, about the size of a door, was missing on the south side, exposing the wood decking beneath. She had found the wind-ripped shingles on the ground on the other side of the house, but we hadn’t known where they had come from until that moment.
The bare patch of wood deck was over the center of the house. Below it was our second-floor bedroom, and below that was the living room where I played acoustic guitar a couple of times a week. The house is more than 100 years old, but the roof was rather new, and as I looked up at where the shingles had been, I imagined rainwater pouring into the heart of the house. I’m handy with tools when I’ve a mind to, but I’m afraid of heights. I muttered something to Kim about not worrying, that I would find somebody to climb up and fix it, but inside me something was shrieking like a stall alarm on a Cessna 172. There had been a series of weather-related challenges at home over the past two years, including a favorite maple tree blowing down on the garage. Due to professional setbacks, money was tight.
The missing shingles felt personal.
Those shingles were still on my mind when I went to Topeka for lunch business. I had placed a call to the contractor who originally put on the roof but had not yet received a response. At least the sky was clear that afternoon.
After lunch, I drove over and parked at the meters on the other side of the street from Capitol Police headquarters. I plugged the meter with four quarters, enough for an hour, and then slung my old Canon DSLR camera over my shoulder. There were a few people on the sidewalk, bags over their shoulders coming to or from work, and a handful of workman at the east entrance to the Capitol. But when I followed the sidewalk to the south lawn I found myself alone, amid green lawns, a few statues, and the immensity of the copper-domed building rising before me.
The solitude was restful.
I passed a sculpture of a seated Abraham Lincoln on my journey, then approached the Capitol and photographed a number of architectural features, steps, columns, pediments. I circled the flower beds. I went over and examined a ground-level replica of the Ad Astra statue atop the statehouse dome, an eight-foot Kansa warrior with drawn bow. Then I wandered back to the Lincoln statue, which I found oddly comforting.
The seated Lincoln faces away from the Capitol. One hand rests on a lanky knee. The face is of the bearded Lincoln, the one familiar to us from the profile on our pennies and the Lincoln Memorial in Washington and Alexander Gardner’s 1865 “cracked plate” photograph. But while Gardner’s portrait carries a hint of a smile, the Lincoln on the state Capitol lawn is full of care and sorrow.
This sorrowful Lincoln offered wisdom.
I’m no Lincoln scholar. I cannot tell you anything about the flawed and fated man who led the nation through its greatest trial that you cannot read in a dozen biographies. Doris Kearns Goodwin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who wrote “Team of Rivals,” has said that Lincoln suffered from depressive episodes so severe that his friends removed all razors and scissors from his room. Jon Meacham, another presidential historian, author of “There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,” has said Lincoln “was a politician — but a politician ultimately driven by conscience.”
Knowing that Lincoln went through dark periods of depression and managed to redeem the soul of America gives me hope. It isn’t an expectation that I am personally destined for greatness, but it is proof that seemingly overwhelming burdens can be endured.
I sometimes declare in my weaker periods that I can’t stand things anymore.
Kim observes: “And yet there you stand.”
Indeed, here we all stand. We may be frightened, anxious, at the end of collective or individual ropes, but as long as we remain standing we are not yet beaten. The primary task before us is to endure. To help others, we must ourselves remain on our feet.
The bronze statue of Lincoln at the Kansas Capitol was the first public commission by Merrell Gage. It was unveiled Feb. 12, 1918.
Gage, a 1911 graduate of Topeka High School, later studied sculpture with Gutzon Borglum, a bigot who carved Mount Rushmore. Gage, who taught for 33 years at the University of Southern California, considered Lincoln an “inexhaustible” subject. In 1955, Gage was the subject of a short documentary in which he sculpted the head of Lincoln from clay while talking about the president’s life. The film won an Oscar. Gage died in 1981.
Gage was an artist of his time, an era when poet Carl Sandburg produced a hagiographic biography of Lincoln that is now recognized as being more literature and less fact. But it is Sandburg’s Lincoln, perhaps more than any other single work, that shaped the perception of the 16th president as a benevolent and martyred father.
Each American generation interprets Lincoln anew. While Gage likely had Sandburg’s Lincoln in mind, my interpretation of Lincoln has been shaped by Goodwin and Meacham and others, including Steven Spielberg. It has also been skewed by Richard Nixon’s manic and impromptu visit with anti-war protestors at the Lincoln Memorial one night in May 1970. Lincoln continues to evolve in my understanding, as the dangers facing democracy have deepened.
These dangers have sharpened so fast that it is worth a moment to recount. It is the most grotesque freak show of any carnival midway.
Eighty years of global leadership has been endangered by the clumsy authoritarian urges of a president drunk with self-importance and enabled by a Congress controlled by a Quisling majority. The hunt for DEI in government is the new McCarthyism with a bigoted twist, due process is trammeled by mass deportations that send some detainees to a notorious foreign prison, and the U.S. turned its back on longtime military and commercial allies. The rolling crises lurch from the catastrophic to the absurd, from a tariff war that few credible economists understand to an apparatchik-worthy declaration that Veterans Day would be known as “Victory Day for World War I.” And then there is DOGE, the revenge-driven wrecking ball dismantling the federal government in the name of cost-saving efficiency.
All of this was predictable. Anybody who had paid attention to Donald Trump’s insane ramblings or was familiar with Project 2025 knew where we were headed. We are in the midst of a radical transformation of America into a bizarro-world of opposite values. The grifting of the presidency, from Trump’s crypto scam worth billions to the Qatari gift of a $400 million luxury jet to replace Air Force One, should dismay all but surprise none.
What has surprised me is the apparent inability of Democrats to mount a coherent political response. Oh, there have been scattered strong voices –Bernie Saunders, Cory Booker, AOC, Elizabeth Warren — but these seem like cries in the wilderness. Mass political protests, including the May Day event in Topeka, seem to have the most momentum. But at some point, to be effective, protest has to coalesce around a leader with a conscience who is able to articulate the case for democracy and a path forward to a better America.
Meanwhile, we must remain standing.
We do not need another Lincoln — our allotment was one — but we do need a human being and not a seated statue. Where will this individual come from? I have no idea. But they are surely already among us, if only we take the care to recognize them, flaws and all.
This is a time not only for resisting, but for knowing why we resist. American greatness, in the Trumpian sense, is antithetical to American goodness. What is best for democracy — that is, what benefits the most fortunate as well as the least fortunate — is not efficiency but empathy. Governments are not businesses because the goal should be to serve all of the people, not the monied few.
Nobody wants waste. But the touting of cost-cutting efficiencies is a canard to distract us from the unchecked kleptocracy of oligarchs and the influence of foreign princes. To repair this rot, we must engage in a vigorous campaign to restore fundamental American values of dignity, equality, and robust democracy.
I finally reached someone who agreed to come take a look at our roof. He was a young man named Brian who took a couple of days to show up, but who was cheerful and talkative when he did. He extended a ladder above our gutter and climbed up on the roof, walking about as easily as I would in my living room.
He inspected the damage with a practiced eye.
“No problem,” he declared.
The repair was made in half an hour. Brian promised to send a bill, but I never got one.
My weariness will likely continue for a while longer. But I am helped by the knowledge that I don’t have to remain standing forever. I will stand today, and after that I will stand tomorrow. For the places in which I am afraid, there are others who will stand for me. In the places in which others are afraid, I will stand for them.
Statues belong to the past and the future.
The present belongs to the living.

HIGHWAYS:

The average distance driven on I-95 in Connecticut is 11 miles.

Some 180,000 vehicles drive all or part of the 112 miles that I-95 runs through our state.  But even factoring in true interstate drivers (think Florida to Maine), the average distance driven in Connecticut is tiny.  Why?  Because we use I-95 like a local road to avoid Route 1, not just for interstate travel.

Trucks are banned from the Merritt Parkway. But in 1943 trucks were allowed on that roadway as part of the war effort.

But trucks in those days were much lower, easily clearing the bridges.
AVIATION:

The supersonic Concorde was a real gas-guzzler. In the 15 minutes from leaving the gate until takeoff, the jet burned two metric tons of Jet A gas… enough to fly a conventional jet for an hour — from Heathrow in London to Charles DeGaulle Airport in Paris.

Carrying just 100 passengers, The Concorde would burn about a ton of fuel per passenger crossing the Atlantic.

The busiest airport in the world is Atlanta’s Hartsfield International (ATL), handling 108 million passengers last year… almost 296,000 a day.

And most of them fly Delta, which hosts 165 of the airport’s 192 gates, a 86% share of the capacity. 

This is a January 21, 1976 photo of a British Airways Concorde as it makes its inaugural flight from Heathrow Airport in London.   Credit: AP Photo/Dave Caulkin
METRO-NORTH:

Did you know that a fully loaded eight-car train on Metro-North can carry over 1,000 passengers… more than double the capacity of a fully loaded 747.
The 24-mile-long Danbury branch line used to be electrified. But the wires were ripped out in 1961 to save money by running diesels. The copper was sold as scrap.
Grand Central Terminal has 67 tracks and 44 platforms, more than any station in the world.

And never call it “Grand Central Station.”  That’s the name of the post office and subway station nearby.
HIGH SPEED RAIL:

America’s only “high speed train” (Acela) can go up to 160 mph. But the average speed it runs traveling 456 miles from Washington, D.C. to Boston is just 70 mph.
China has the largest high speed network in the world covering more than 29,000 miles and carrying 4 billion passenger trips. Its trains run as fast as 260 mph.

TRANSIT FARES:

In Portland Oregon the trains don’t have “Senior” fares. Instead, Seniors, Veterans, active-duty military personnel, handicapped and low-income residents are called “Honored Citizens” and get 50 – 75% off regular fares.

SHIPPING:

The biggest container ships sailing today can carry over 24,000 containers.

But those mega-ships are too big for the Panama Canal… but not for the Suez Canal, which has no locks.

New York’s Staten Island Ferry can carry over 6,000 passengers per trip. That added up to 25 million passengers in 2019… more than double the population of Greece.

And yes, the Staten Island Ferry is free.  The old 50 cent fare was dropped in 1997 in a nod to the city’s efforts to make access to the tiny borough more affordable.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ap-chinese-rail.jpg,,,2025-05-18 05:00:52.503172

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A major elections reform bill, a priority of House and Senate leaders, is dead in the Alaska Legislature.
Wednesday is the last day of the regular legislative session, and members of the House’s multipartisan majority said on Saturday that they lack the support needed to overcome the opposition of the House’s Republican minority in the time they have left.
Bills don’t expire at the end of the first year of the two-year legislative session, but Senate Bill 64 needed to become law this year in order to be implemented in time for the 2026 election.
Among the changes in the bill: Speedier ballot counting, better tracking of absentee ballots, ballot dropboxes across the state, free return postage for absentee ballots, a liaison to help fix voting issues in rural Alaska, permanent absentee ballot registration, a method to fix paperwork problems after an absentee ballot is cast, the elimination of the requirement that a “witness” sign a voter’s absentee ballot, and additional security audits.
Many of the House’s Republicans objected to the bill, saying that they believe it did not do enough to address their concerns about election security.
The Senate passed SB 64 on Monday, but Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome and co-chair of the House Finance Committee said that House Republicans were prepared to offer so many amendments to the bill that it would have required members of the House to abandon all other work in order to push the bill across the finish line. Even then, it could have been vetoed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Republican. 
With those possibilities in play, the House majority’s 14 Democrats, five independents and two Republicans met behind closed doors and decided to abandon the effort. 
“The caucus just said, ‘We’re either gonna have to set everything else aside and focus on that, and probably still won’t get it through, or we just say we’re going to have to set it aside,’” Foster said.
“We all decided as a group that … to try to do it in four days, it was not good public process. If we had two weeks, that would have been fast tracking it, and maybe we could have gotten it through,” he said.
A disproportionately large number of absentee ballots are rejected from rural Alaska in each election cycle, and Foster — in charge of scheduling bills for the House Finance Committee — said he really wanted to see SB 64 advance, but it was clear that it wasn’t possible, barring an unlikely special session.
Late Friday, as the bill’s fate became clear, the Republican minority issued a triumphant news release.
“This bill greases the skids for all mail-in elections like Anchorage has. SB 64 is the biggest hoax that the Democrats have promulgated so far this year — and that is saying a lot since there are some other bills that are contenders,” said Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, in the message. “Alaskans should be appalled. Talk about a bill that will bring out more fraud! SB 64 is the Election Fraud bill!”
Other Republican opponents were more measured.
“Rushing a nonpartisan bill through at the last minute isn’t how the legislative process is meant to work. I’m glad we’ll have the chance to take a closer look at SB 64 next year,” said Rep. Frank Tomaszewski, R-Fairbanks, in the news release.
Sen. Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage and the lead person pushing SB 64, noted that this is the third time in the past three legislative sessions that the Legislature has failed to pass a significant elections bill.
“I know there’s groups out there that are looking at ballot initiatives. Very frankly, at this point, they’re just so frustrated with the Legislature because it’s been a decade working on this bill,” he said. “So I think if we don’t get something done this year, you’re going to start seeing some people talk about just doing an initiative for the sections that they want.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)There will be no extra money for the University of Alaska’s sports teams, its effort to become a top-tier research university or its attempts to hire and keep staff.
On Friday, the legislative committee assigned to write the final version of Alaska’s state operating budget axed all of those items — and many more — from its in-progress draft.
Alaska is facing a severe budget crunch, thanks to low oil prices and reduced federal spending, and lawmakers are eliminating almost every previously considered addition, even before Gov. Mike Dunleavy gets a chance to use his veto pen.
Flat funding, combined with inflation, means cuts for most state services. The Permanent Fund dividend isn’t immune, either. It’s expected to be about $1,000 this year, the lowest figure in state history, once adjusted for inflation.
“It’s just a really challenging time, and there’s a lot of volatility, and Alaska’s heavily dependent upon federal funds,” said Sen. Scott Kawasaki, D-Fairbanks. “We don’t have that huge buffer of oil and gas funds that we once did.”
Rep. Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, appeared resigned to the decisions when asked for comment.
“It is what it is,” he said.
Among the university’s budget cuts is $150,000 for a staff member to help the university’s efforts on diversity, equity and inclusion. The University’s Board of Regents voted earlier this year to cancel DEI efforts, including those intended to help Alaska Native students.
“We obviously are cut down to the bone if we’re talking about individual, singular positions in the budget, and the board of regents has taken a position that’s alternative to what I think the UA community broadly wants to see happen, so it puts our Legislature as an appropriating body in a really difficult position making those kinds of decisions,” said Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks.
The budget maneuvering isn’t restricted to the University of Alaska. At the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, legislators have cut road maintenance spending and have requested a report on the feasibility of turning the Dalton Highway — Alaska’s overland link to the North Slope — into a toll road.
A plan to put more Alaska state troopers in Kotzebue to fight child abuse crimes was only partially funded, and $2.3 million for additional trooper overtime was trimmed to $1 million. 
The conference committee, in charge of combining different budget drafts approved by the state House and Senate, may also cancel plans for additional state and wildlife troopers in Talkeetna.
Legislators are asking DPS to begin meeting with the Kenai, Fairbanks and Matanuska-Susitna boroughs about setting up local police in those areas in order to replace troopers.
“It is the intent of the legislature to direct public safety funds to areas of the state that do not have the tax base to provide needed policing services to their communities,” the latest budget draft states.
A few budget increases remain — $250,000 more for maintenance at the state’s trial courts, $292,000 more for security screening of legislative mail, and additional state funding for Alaska’s forestry program as part of an effort to increase logging.
For the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, the conference committee approved backstop funding for public schools in case Dunleavy vetoes House Bill 57, which would permanently increase the state’s per-student funding formula.
The backstop language includes a one-time bonus that’s slightly smaller than the increase included within HB 57. That increase is itself lower than the rate of inflation.
The committee declined to increase funding for special education, child nutrition, early education, and state libraries, archives and museums. But lawmakers did approve an increase for career and technical education initiatives.
They temporarily postponed a decision on items related to foreign teacher recruitment and training, at the request of Sen. James Kaufman, R-Anchorage.
Those may be taken up as soon as Sunday.
The committee approved $5.5 million for child advocacy centers, which support child victims of physical and sexual abuse. That money was added after the federal government cut funding for the centers.
For the state prison system, the budget directs the closure of part of Spring Creek Correctional Center and directs the Alaska Department of Corrections to prepare a report for the Legislature evaluating which prisons would provide the most cost savings if closed. Budget negotiators also rejected increased funding for vocational training programs intended to aid Alaskans who leave the prison system. 
Several items are still being debated, and the conference committee was scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. Sunday to finalize the compromise budget draft.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)The Utah GOP’s state delegates have charted the next chapter for the state’s dominant political party — sticking with an incumbent who characterized himself as a “bridge builder” rather than a burner.
With nearly 67% turnout during their organizing convention at Utah Valley University in Orem on Saturday, 2,645 Utah Republican Party state delegates voted to reelect Rob Axson as their party chair, handing another loss to his challenger and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Phil Lyman.
Axson won with about 54% (1,430 votes), to Lyman’s nearly 46% (1,215 votes), according to the party’s election results. 
The vote settled what many delegates considered a toss-up contest — but Axson won with a healthy majority. Though Lyman and his “Make Utah Great Again” campaign was given a warm reception with loud cheers from passionate supporters, Axson was a formidable incumbent, buoyed by an endorsement from President Donald Trump about a week before the convention. 
To Axson, his victory showed delegates “want to see more” of what he’s started in the Utah Republican Party. 
“They want to see additional momentum. They want to see growth,” Axson told reporters after his win. “They’ve seen what I’ve delivered over the last two years … and that is now the new foundation. Let’s build from there.”

Axson vs. Lyman
Axson — who championed his fundraising record as chair of the party since 2023 and framed himself as a “bridge builder” rather than a burner — was also endorsed by other Utah Republican Party heavyweights, including Sen. Mike Lee and other Utahns in Congress, as well as high-ranking state leaders including House Speaker Mike Schultz, and former party chair Carson Jorgensen.
Axson or Lyman? Utah Republican delegates to elect their next leader

Lyman, on the other hand, campaigned against the “establishment,” continuing a barrage of unsubstantiated claims that he peddled during his unsuccessful bid last year against Gov. Spencer Cox that there’s “corruption” and election fraud in Utah government. 
In the end, though, delegates signaled they liked the track Axson has put the party on over the last two years, while they rejected Lyman’s pitch for a more combative — perhaps even unlawful — future GOP. 
While challenging Axson for party chair, Lyman painted himself as a leader who would position the Utah GOP to more aggressively assert its capability to select Republican nominees rather than follow SB54, a 2014 state law that allows a dual path to the primary through both the caucus and convention process and through signature gathering. 
Though Axson also agreed Utah Republicans should continue fighting SB54, he disagreed with taking Lyman’s approach, which Axson argued would amount to breaking the law. Instead, Axson said the party should focus on working with the Utah Legislature to change the law. 
During his speech, Axson told delegates that SB54 “still undermines the principles of our party.” However, he also said “the law is the law, and claiming otherwise is not a strategy for success, no matter how loudly you do so.”

“We must repeal SB54, but we cannot unless we are united,” he said. “We can’t beat SB54 if we spend all our time beating one another.”
Without naming Lyman during his speech, Axson said there’s a “clear difference between me and others: I am not willing to break the law, especially to break the law in a way that will jeopardize our Republican candidates and force them to get signatures instead of leaning into the delegate process that we all believe in.” 
Axson also touted the endorsement from Trump, along with support from members of Utah’s congressional delegation and others.
“Ultimately if we want to be successful beyond the next 20 years, if we hope to bring the next generation into the Republican Party, we must build,” he said. 
Lyman, during his speech, didn’t specifically address SB54 or specifics about his vision as party leader, but he focused on his philosophical stance for a government that “belongs to the people.”

“I wish that I lived in 1765 back in Boston,” Lyman said, adding that if he did, “I would have been a member of the Sons of Liberty,” referring to a secretive and sometimes violent political organization in the 13 American Colonies that worked to fight taxation by the British government. 
“I would have been there in 1770 when the Boston Massacre occurred, I would have been there in 1773 when the (Boston) Tea Party took place,” Lyman said. “Because those people were pushing back against the government that did not have their interests at heart. That’s what we’re about.”
Lyman said the Sons of Liberty were “called all kinds of horrible names too, including bridge burners, but they actually burned bridges to impede the direction of their enemy.” 
Lyman also issued a call to action to unite Utah Republicans, regardless of the outcome of the race for GOP chair. 
“From this point, we will be united,” he said. “I will stand behind Rob Axson. He’s a friend of mine. I love Donald Trump, he’s my president. I’ve supported him. I appreciate Sen. Lee. … I recognize their efforts, I support them.”
But Lyman concluded his speech by telling delegates “this is a time for you.” 
“This is your party. The Republican Party is yours. And today you will decide what direction this party takes,” he said, to loud cheers.

Continued angst with SB54
On full display throughout the convention was Republican delegates’ continued hatred of SB54.  Utah lawmakers passed the law more than 10 years ago as a compromise to ward off a looming ballot initiative to do away with the caucus and convention system altogether in favor of signature gathering. 
But ever since, Utah Republican Party caucus system loyalists have despised the law, even though it’s survived multiple court challenges that almost drove the Utah GOP to bankruptcy. It’s become one of the largest wedges dividing Utah Republicans, and Republicans’ strategy to continue fighting it was at the heart of the contest between Axson and Lyman. 
But if there was an early indication that most delegates weren’t in favor of taking a scorched earth approach to challenge SB54 further, one of the first votes they took Saturday morning was to strip from the agenda a proposed amendment to the party’s constitution that would temporarily revoke a Republican candidate’s party membership if they gain access to the ballot through signature gathering rather than through the caucus and convention system.

State law specifies two types of political parties: registered parties and qualified political parties. Candidates of registered parties must use signature gathering to access the ballot, while candidates of qualified parties (a designation the Utah GOP currently functions under), can either gather signatures or be nominated at convention. Utah law does not have a designation that lets parties only allow ballot access through nomination. 
If the state GOP’s proposed amendment to strip a candidate’s party membership for using a legal pathway to the ballot had passed, it would have violated state law and possibly could have led to yet another court challenge. 
The amendment’s sponsor, Arnold Gaunt, motioned to remove it from the agenda, saying “there’s a better path for responding to the problem.” 
Axson told reporters that he’s “not a fan” of SB54 and the signature gathering path, but he  focused his message on “not lawsuits, not division, not purity tests. It’s building something that can’t be ignored.” 
“If we build an apparatus that every Utahn and every community feels that there’s a value in that, well they’re going to come along with us,” Axson said. “They’re going to be supportive of what we’re trying to do, and the Legislature is going to listen to that.”

Axson said his preference would be for the Legislature to repeal SB54. Pressed on whether that’s a real possibility, he told reporters “the votes are there in the House” while they’re “not there yet in the Senate.” 
“But it can’t be a vitriolic conversation. It’s not threats. It has to be a conversation that’s transparent and up front and collaborative,” Axson said. “If we can show the value of what the Republican Party is doing … and trying to grow and build additional capacity, we make it a lot easier on these elected officials to take the hard votes of repealing SB54.” 
However, Axson acknowledged “it’s going to take some time.” 
“How long or how short that is, I don’t know,” Axson said. “But I do know we have in our ability the opportunity to build a strong party, and that will be a benefit in repealing SB54 or solving other complex issues.” 
Axson’s influential supporters 
The morning of the convention, Axson’s predecessor, former Utah GOP Chair Carson Jorgensen, was chatting up delegates wearing an Axson button on his shirt. He said Axson is the right leader for the party, lauding him as a proven organizer and fundraiser who helped bring the party out of bankruptcy after multiple failed legal challenges of SB54. 
Jorgensen said Axson will take the right approach by focusing on working with lawmakers to strengthen the caucus-convention system rather than more lawsuits. 
Are delegates in touch with Utah voters? Survey reveals where they ‘align and diverge’

“I like Phil personally as a friend, I think he’s a nice guy,” Jorgensen said. “But here’s the thing. There are three ways we’re going to navigate SB54, and only three. One is the lawsuit route. We’ve tried it. It doesn’t work. Phil is 0 for 5 on lawsuits. The party can’t afford another lawsuit.”
Jorgensen said the next option is a “legislative fix,” which requires a “relationship with the Legislature.” 
“Sorry, but Phil has burned every — every — bridge he had with any legislator,” Jorgensen said. 
The last option, he said, is the party opts to hold its own primary. 
“What does that take? Money,” Jorgensen said. “If the party’s going to hold their own primary, they’ve got to fund it. We figure between $1.5 and $3 million to run it. Rob has shown he can raise that kind of money.” 
So Axson has “two of the three that need to happen, and Phil doesn’t have any,” Jorgensen concluded. “That’s why I support Rob.” 
Jorgensen also issued a call to Utah Republicans to set their differences aside and coalesce behind the new chair. 
 “Everybody needs to get back on the same page. This has been a pretty toxic election,” he said, adding that someone recently called him an “establishment RHINO hack.” To that, he said, “you obviously don’t know me and you’re on the wrong side of things, because you don’t find anybody more conservative than I am.” 
Utah’s SB54 still stands despite 10 years of angst. Will lawmakers change it?

Another Axson supporter seen mingling with delegates was House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, who was also acting as a delegate Saturday. He told Utah News Dispatch that he’d be voting for Axson for party chair “because we need somebody to bring all sides together.” 
“That’s what we do in the Legislature,” Schultz said. “We have to work to find common ground.”
Why not Lyman? Schultz declined to comment, focusing his remarks instead on his support of Axson. Trump’s endorsement of Axson, Schultz said, indicates Trump “has noticed something different about Utah.” 
“He has embraced Utah and sees Utah as being able to help push the agenda that he’s pushing on a nationwide level,” Schultz said. “I think that’s why you saw President Trump chime in and say, what you’re doing in Utah is working, stick with it.” 
Schultz added that Utah Republicans need to realize “if we split up our party, we lose.” 
“If the party gets split, it’s the best thing that can happen for Democrats in the state of Utah,” he said. “So finding ways to keep the party together keeps Utah Republican, it keeps Utah conservative. That’s what President Trump sees and that’s why I’m supporting Rob Axson.” 
How will Utah lawmakers tackle SB54? 
Pressed on efforts to repeal SB54, Schultz told Utah News Dispatch he and lawmakers are open to working with the Utah Republican Party to find a path forward that’s focused on strengthening the caucus and convention system — but he also warned that completely undoing SB54 could have negative consequences. 
“Count My Vote has been very open and saying that they will run a ballot initiative that does away with the caucus convention altogether,” he said. “I think that would be very harmful to the grassroots of our party.” 
Schultz added: “I love the caucus convention system because it does keep money out of politics. So I would like to look for ways to make the caucus and convention system stronger and get their people involved in the caucus and convention system.” 
“That is a good pathway forward,” he said, but he didn’t offer any specifics of what that could look like in legislative action. 
“I truly don’t know,” he said, “but I think we need to understand the consequences of (undoing SB54). We look at the polling, and it’s not even close. If it goes to ballot initiative, we lose the caucus and convention system. And I think that would be horrible. I would rather find ways to make the caucus and convention system stronger.”

The ‘MUGA’ message that resonated with many, but failed
Wearing a maroon MUGA hat in support of Lyman, Tiffany Mendenhall, of Ivins, said she was all in favor of Lyman for chair. 
Signature audit finds ‘some errors’ — but Cox still ultimately qualified for primary

“Lyman has our best interest at heart,” she said, adding that she didn’t like the outcome of the governor’s race last year and the direction the Utah GOP has been heading. “Phil is very well aware of what’s going on with all the crookedness and all of that stuff. He intends to get us back to more traditional voting methods so that there’s no fraud.” 
Though Utah’s election was certified and Cox legally qualified as a Republican candidate before he went on to win the election, Mendenhall said she believed the governor’s race was “absolutely stolen,” arguing he “didn’t have the signatures.” 
While signature gathering audits did find “some errors” and that based on statistical error rates Cox could have initially fallen short of the 28,000-signature requirement, auditors also reported that had clerks told him he hadn’t qualified (which they didn’t), he would have had 28 days more days to submit enough signatures. Ultimately, the audits concluded Cox followed the law and qualified for the primary.
Mendenhall, however, stood firm on the false claim that Lyman has repeatedly pushed throughout both his gubernatorial and Utah GOP chair campaigns — that Cox was an illegitimate candidate and “stole” the election.
“You can’t tell us that it wasn’t. And so how can we feel that we have a fair election when our governor in charge is a cheat?” Mendenhall said. She argued Axson hasn’t done enough to challenge what happened during the governor’s race. “He hasn’t stood up to take care of this. This shouldn’t have happened.”

Photo by Andrew VonBank/House Public Information Services.With just over 48 hours prior to the Legislature’s mandatory adjournment midnight Monday, lawmakers are still struggling to resolve a few key issues as they aim for a two-year budget to fund everything from roads to schools, parks, health and social services.
Several large budget bills have yet to be negotiated between the 67-67 divided House and the Democratic-controlled Senate — health and human services, education, a potential infrastructure package and a tax bill — i.e., the most complex and contentious.
The lack of movement on these bills makes a special session all the more likely. Legislative leaders say they anticipate a one-day special session prior to Memorial Day, though it could be longer.
Lawmakers have to pass a budget by June 30 or the government will shut down.
Among the major sticking points: cutting MinnesotaCare for undocumented immigrant adults. Some rank-and-file, progressive Democrats broke with their leaders and Gov. Tim Walz and protested the budget agreement over the proposal and harshly criticized Democratic leadership for acquiescing to one of the Republicans’ top priorities.
House DFL Caucus leader Melissa Hortman, DFL-Brooklyn Park, appearing Friday on TPT Almanac, said Democrats will need to compromise given the divided government.
“People need to bend. They need to understand they won’t get everything they want,” Hortman said.
Rep. Cedric Frazier, DFL-New Hope, who is also co-chair of the progressive People of Color and Indigenous Caucus, told reporters Saturday that the POCI Caucus doesn’t plan to shut down the government over cutting MinnesotaCare for undocumented adults.
“We care about all the Minnesotans, and we’re not willing to shut the government down, but we’re willing to make sure we work very hard to ensure the Minnesotans get what they need,” Frazier said.
Other contentious debates include potential changes to the state’s new paid leave and earned sick and safe time programs and cuts to taxpayer aid for private schools.
Walz has proposed cutting $109 million in aid that helps private schools with transportation, counseling and textbooks. The state has allocated this funding to private schools for decades, but Walz and Democrats are proposing the cuts amid a projected multi-billion dollar budget deficit beginning in 2027.
On Thursday, House Speaker Lisa Demuth, R-Cold Spring, gave reporters the impression that private school aid would not be touched and presented this as a win for Republicans.
“We also know that we have made great strides in protecting the funding for non-public education. We are protecting our schools,” Demuth said. “We are protecting our students so they can learn in the best way forward.”
But cuts to private school aid are still in play, as far as a key DFL senator is concerned.
Sen. Mary Kunesh, DFL-New Brighton, said that funding for private school aid wasn’t part of the global budget agreement, and protecting public education is a priority for Senate Democrats.
“I understand the uniqueness and the value of non-public schools, but as the chair of the Education Finance Committee in the state of Minnesota, my priority is to fund public schools at the best rate and in the best way possible,” Kunesh said in an interview with the Reformer.
A source with the House Republican caucus told the Reformer that there’s “no scenario where we will agree to” any cuts.
Kunesh, who also serves as an assistant majority leader, said that the cuts to private schools are part of her education budget, and she anticipates this issue to be a sticking point in budget negotiations between members of the House and Senate — also known as a conference committee.
“We just have to remind those members also that we have that obligation to public schools first,” Kunesh said. 
In between the Senate and House floor sessions, Rep. Dave Baker, R-Wilmar, and Sen. Judy Seeberger, DFL-Afton, held a small press gaggle near the Capitol rotunda to tell reporters that significant changes to the state’s paid leave and earned sick and safe time programs are still on the table, despite their absence from the legislative leaders’ budget agreement.
Legislative leaders agreed to reduce the paid leave payroll tax cap that the Department of Employment and Economic Development could implement each year from 1.2% to 1.1%. But since paid leave will launch in January with a 0.88% payroll tax split between employers and workers, the reduction does nothing to change the program as currently constituted.
Baker said Demuth has given him her blessing to keep trying to implement paid leave changes in conference committee, though he didn’t say what he would specifically look to change. Throughout the session, Baker has attempted to exempt small employers from the paid leave requirement.
“We’re just trying to get (paid leave) right-sized a little bit,” Baker told reporters.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GrLrAVuXkAAtEyn-1024x731.jpeg,,,2025-05-17 19:03:33.120583

(Jackie Fortíer/KFF Health News)In the dim basement of a Salt Lake City pharmacy, hundreds of amber-colored plastic pill bottles sit stacked in rows, one man’s defensive wall in a tariff war.
Independent pharmacist Benjamin Jolley and his colleagues worry that the tariffs, aimed at bringing drug production to the United States, could instead drive companies out of business while raising prices and creating more of the drug shortages that have plagued American patients for several years.
Jolley bought six months’ worth of the most expensive large bottles, hoping to shield his business from the 10% across-the-board tariffs on imported goods that President Donald Trump announced April 2. Now with threats of additional tariffs targeting pharmaceuticals, Jolley worries that costs will soar for the medications that will fill those bottles.
In principle, Jolley said, using tariffs to push manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. makes sense. In the event of war, China could quickly stop all exports to the United States.
“I understand the rationale for tariffs. I’m not sure that we’re gonna do it the right way,” Jolley said. “And I am definitely sure that it’s going to raise the price that I pay my suppliers.”

Squeezed by insurers and middlemen, independent pharmacists such as Jolley find themselves on the front lines of a tariff storm. Nearly everyone down the line — drugmakers, pharmacies, wholesalers, and middlemen — opposes most tariffs.
Slashing drug imports could trigger widespread shortages, experts said, because of America’s dependence on Chinese- and Indian-made chemical ingredients, which form the critical building blocks of many medicines. Industry officials caution that steep tariffs on raw materials and finished pharmaceuticals could make drugs more expensive.
“Big ships don’t change course overnight,” said Robin Feldman, a UC Law San Francisco professor who writes about prescription drug issues. “Even if companies pledge to bring manufacturing home, it will take time to get them up and running. The key will be to avoid damage to industry and pain to consumers in the process.”
Trump on April 8 said he would soon announce “a major tariff on pharmaceuticals,” which have been largely tariff-free in the U.S. for 30 years.
“When they hear that, they will leave China,” he said. The U.S. imported $213 billion worth of medicines in 2024 — from China but also India, Europe, and other areas.
Trump’s statement sent drugmakers scrambling to figure out whether he was serious, and whether some tariffs would be levied more narrowly, since many parts of the U.S. drug supply chain are fragile, drug shortages are common, and upheaval at the FDA leaves questions about whether its staffing is adequate to inspect factories, where quality problems can lead to supply chain crises.

On May 12, Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to bring down the prices Americans pay for prescriptions, to put them in line with prices in other countries.
Meanwhile, pharmacists predict even the 10% tariffs Trump has demanded will hurt: Jolley said a potential increase of up to 30 cents a vial is not a king’s ransom, but it adds up when you’re a small pharmacy that fills 50,000 prescriptions a year.
“The one word that I would say right now to describe tariffs is ‘uncertainty,’” said Scott Pace, a pharmacist and owner of Kavanaugh Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas.
To weather price fluctuations, Pace stocked up on the drugs his pharmacy dispenses most.
“I’ve identified the top 200 generics in my store, and I have basically put 90 days’ worth of those on the shelf just as a starting point,” he said. “Those are the diabetes drugs, the blood pressure medicines, the antibiotics — those things that I know folks will be sicker without.”
Pace said tariffs could be the death knell for the many independent pharmacies that exist on “razor-thin margins” — unless reimbursements rise to keep up with higher costs.
Unlike other retailers, pharmacies can’t pass along such costs to patients. Their payments are set by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers largely owned by insurance conglomerates, who act as middlemen between drug manufacturers and purchasers.
Neal Smoller, who employs 15 people at his Village Apothecary in Woodstock, New York, is not optimistic.
“It’s not like they’re gonna go back and say, well, here’s your 10% bump because of the 10% tariff,” he said. “Costs are gonna go up and then the sluggish responses from the PBMs — they’re going to lead us to lose more money at a faster rate than we already are.”
Smoller, who said he has built a niche selling vitamins and supplements, fears that FDA firings will mean fewer federal inspections and safety checks.
“I worry that our pharmaceutical industry becomes like our supplement industry, where it’s the wild West,” he said.
Narrowly focused tariffs might work in some cases, said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on Health Policy. For example, while drug manufacturing plants can cost $1 billion and take three to five years to set up, it would be relatively cheap to build a syringe factory — a business American manufacturers abandoned during the covid-19 pandemic because China was dumping its products here, Wosińska said.
It’s not surprising that giants such as Novartis and Eli Lilly have promised Trump they’ll invest billions in U.S. plants, she said, since much of their final drug product is made here or in Europe, where governments negotiate drug prices. The industry is using Trump’s tariff saber-rattling as leverage; in an April 11 letter, 32 drug companies demanded European governments pay them more or face an exodus to the United States.
Brandon Daniels, CEO of supply chain company Exiger, is bullish on tariffs. He thinks they could help bring some chemical manufacturing back to the U.S., which, when coupled with increased use of automation, would reduce the labor advantages of China and India.
“You’ve got real estate in North Texas that’s cheaper than real estate in Shenzhen,” he said at an economic conference April 25 in Washington, referring to a major Chinese chemical manufacturing center.

But Wosińska said no amount of tariffs will compel makers of generic drugs, responsible for 90% of U.S. prescriptions, to build new factories in the U.S. Payment structures and competition would make it economic suicide, she said.
Several U.S. generics firms have declared bankruptcy or closed U.S. factories over the past decade, said John Murphy, CEO of the Association for Accessible Medicines, the generics trade group. Reversing that trend won’t be easy and tariffs won’t do it, he said.
“There’s not a magic level of tariffs that magically incentivizes them to come into the U.S.,” he said. “There is no room to make a billion-dollar investment in a domestic facility if you’re going to lose money on every dose you sell in the U.S. market.”
His group has tried to explain these complexities to Trump officials, and hopes word is getting through. “We’re not PhRMA,” Murphy said, referring to the powerful trade group primarily representing makers of brand-name drugs. “I don’t have the resources to go to Mar-a-Lago to talk to the president myself.”
Many of the active ingredients in American drugs are imported. Fresenius Kabi, a German company with facilities in eight U.S. states to produce or distribute sterile injectables — vital hospital drugs for cancer and other conditions — complained in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer that tariffs on these raw materials could paradoxically lead some companies to move finished product manufacturing overseas.
Fresenius Kabi also makes biosimilars, the generic forms of expensive biologic drugs such as Humira and Stelara. The United States is typically the last developed country where biosimilars appear on the market because of patent laws.
Louisiana considers ‘homelessness courts’ as housing advocates stress lack of resources

Tariffs on biosimilars coming from overseas — where Fresenius makes such drugs — would further incentivize U.S. use of more expensive brand-name biologics, the March 11 letter said. Biosimilars, which can cost a tenth of the original drug’s price, launch on average 3-4 years later in the U.S. than in Canada or Europe.
In addition to getting cheaper knockoff drugs faster, European countries also pay far less than the United States for brand-name products. Paradoxically, Murphy said, those same countries pay more for generics.
European governments tend to establish more stable contracts with makers of generics, while in the United States, “rabid competition” drives down prices to the point at which a manufacturer “maybe scrimps on product quality,” said John Barkett, a White House Domestic Policy Council member in the Biden administration.
As a result, Wosińska said, “without exemptions or other measures put in place, I really worry about tariffs causing drug shortages.”
Smoller, the New York pharmacist, doesn’t see any upside to tariffs.
“How do I solve the problem of caring for my community,” he said, “but not being subject to the emotional roller coaster that is dispensing hundreds of prescriptions a day and watching every single one of them be a loss or 12 cents profit?”
