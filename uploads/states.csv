He was 79.
Codey’s family announced the news on Facebook, calling him “a beloved husband, father and grandfather.”
“New Jersey lost a remarkable public servant who touched the lives of all who knew him,” they said.
Codey, a Democrat, retired from the New Jersey Legislature in January 2024, capping 50 years as a member of the body representing parts of Essex County. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 1973 and became a state senator in 1982. He served as acting governor starting in 2004 following the resignation of Gov. Jim McGreevey, and again for nearly a month when Gov. Jon Corzine was injured in a car crash in 2007.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) called Codey “a remarkable public servant.”
“Dick Codey lived his life with humility, compassion and a deep sense of responsibility. He spoke the truth when others wouldn’t and he fought tirelessly to improve the lives of the people of New Jersey during his record-setting 50 years of service in the Legislature and as Governor. He gained the trust and respect of other public officials and made friends with Presidents just as easily as he did with strangers in all-night diners,” Scutari said.
Sen. Anthony Bucco (R-Morris), the Senate’s minority leader, said he is “heartbroken” over the loss.
“We worked together on many important issues that helped move New Jersey forward, and I came to know him as a true friend and someone who led with humility, kindness, and humor. He leaves behind a lasting legacy of service and integrity that will be felt for generations. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those whose lives he touched during this very difficult time,” Bucco said.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s top law enforcement official wants lawmakers to stiffen penalties for selling drugs in prison and making deepfake pornography, to create consumer protections for DNA data, and to give internet crime investigators swifter access to suspects’ user data.
Those bills are among the 10 proposed by Attorney General Marty Jackley for the 2026 legislative session that begins Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
In a news release Wednesday, Jackley said the package “focuses on many issues this office has dealt with in the past year” and that he looks forward to “working with the governor and legislators during the session on these important opportunities to protect South Dakota.”
Lawmakers have endorsed most of Jackley’s proposals during each legislative session since his ascent to a second stint as attorney general in the 2022 general election.
Some proposals have seen tweaks, however, including one in 2025 that attempted to affix felony penalties for the failure of state employee supervisors to report employee misconduct. Lawmakers passed that bill, but ultimately opted for misdemeanor penalties.
Here are summaries of this year’s proposals.
Senate Bill 17: Foreign political donations
This bill would bar political candidates in South Dakota from accepting donations from foreign nationals. It aims to amend an existing law that prohibits campaign contributions from states, state agencies, foreign governments, federal agencies or the federal government. One violation could net a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. Two or more violations in a single year could draw up to two years in prison.
Senate Bill 41: Deepfakes
This bill targets “deepfake” pornography, created with digital technology to resemble a real person without that person’s consent. The bill would amend an existing law, adding a definition of “digitally fabricated material” and making it a crime to “create, disclose, disseminate, distribute, or sell” such material when it depicts a nonconsenting person in a “state of nudity,” or engaged in any manner of sexual act.
Senate Bill 42: Prison drugs
Currently, possession of controlled substances in prison — by inmates or staff members — is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. This bill would up the penalty to a maximum of 15 years. The bill would also update the state’s drug ingestion statutes to make it a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, for an inmate or parolee to fail a drug test for controlled substances. Ingestion of a controlled substance was a felony for everyone until last year, when lawmakers voted to make first- and second-offense ingestion a misdemeanor. Jackley opposed that move.
Senate Bill 43: Digital currency seizures
Currently, law enforcement is empowered to seize money and property with suspected ties to felony crimes during criminal investigations. This bill would add “digital currency” like Bitcoin to law enforcement’s list of assets seizable during criminal investigations.
Senate Bill 44: Internet crimes
This bill would let the attorney general or a designee ask a Hughes County judge to subpoena information on internet users suspected of crimes against children or human trafficking. Hughes County judges would be able to issue those subpoenas regardless of where a crime took place, where the suspect’s internet service provider might be located, or where the subpoena would be enforced. The multi-agency Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force is headquartered in Pierre, which is in Hughes County.
Senate Bill 45: Marijuana-like intoxicants
Selling products made with the marijuana-like intoxicant known as delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (Delta-9 THC-A on product labels) to anyone younger than 21 could draw up to two years in prison under the terms of this bill. Buying THC-A products for or sharing them with a person under 21 would also be forbidden. Other products containing pot-like compounds, including Delta-8 THC or THC-O, are already covered by the provisions of the law SB 45 seeks to amend.
Senate Bill 46: Public meeting agendas
This bill would require agendas for open public meetings to list every item to be discussed. Each agenda item would also need to be “described in sufficient detail to reasonably inform the public of any official business or public policy intended to be considered at the meeting.” Violations would be punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 47: Closed sessions of public meetings
This bill would revise the rules for closed-door executive sessions during public meetings. It would add a handful of items, such as discussions of cybersecurity and talk of ammunition locations, to the list of acceptable reasons to go into executive session. The bill would also require that votes to enter an executive session and the section of law justifying the session be logged in the meeting minutes. Violations could draw up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 48: Advance meeting notices
This bill would “clarify” that agendas for public meetings of state agencies or commissions must be posted online 72 hours in advance of a meeting, not counting Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays. Current law requires a 72-hour notice at the “principal office of the board, commission, or department holding the meeting” but doesn’t specify the timing for posting an online agenda. Violations of the law could draw up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
Senate Bill 49: DNA data
This one is designed to protect consumer privacy as it relates to DNA data. It says that any person or organization that collects DNA has to spell out privacy policies and tell consumers upfront if their DNA will be shared with any partner organization. It would be illegal to share or sell DNA data to others without the express consent of the person who provided it, unless the data is “de-identified” and shared for research purposes alone. DNA collectors would also be required to let people access their own data and delete it upon request. Violations could draw civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation. The rules wouldn’t apply for colleges, research institutions or forensic laboratories, or to data collected for medical purposes.

Linda McMahon, the nation’s secretary of education, says public schools are failing.
In November, she promised a “hard reset” of the system in which more than 80% of U.S. children learn. But rather than invest in public education, she has been working to dismantle the Department of Education and enact wholesale changes to how public schools operate.
“Our final mission as a department is to fully empower states to carry the torch of our educational renaissance,” she said at a November press conference.
To help her carry out these and other goals, McMahon has brought at least 20 advisers from ultraconservative think tanks and advocacy groups who share her skepticism of the value of public education and seek deep changes, including instilling Christian values into public schools.
ProPublica reporters Jennifer Smith Richards and Megan O’Matz spent months reporting and reviewing dozens of hours of video to understand the ideals and ambitions of those pulling the levers of power in federal education policy. They found a concerted push to shrink public school systems by steering taxpayer dollars to private, religious and charter schools, as well as options like homeschooling. The Education Department did not respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica.
They also found top officials expressing a vision for the remaining public schools that rejects the separation of church and state and promotes a pro-America vision of history, an “uplifting portrayal of the nation’s founding ideals.” Critics argue the “patriotic” curricula downplay the legacy of slavery and paper over episodes of discrimination.
Since its establishment in 1979, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has served as an enforcer of anti-discrimination laws in schools and colleges around the country. It’s the place parents turn to when they believe their schools failed to protect children from discrimination or to provide access to an equal education under the law.
The Trump administration laid off much of the office’s staff in its first months and prioritized investigations into schools that allegedly discriminated against white and Jewish students and accommodated transgender students. McMahon and the department have framed this as a course correction in line with efforts to be more efficient and curb diversity, equity and inclusion policies from prior administrations. It has left little recourse for those seeking to defend the rights of students with disabilities, students of color and those facing sex discrimination.
In this video, Smith Richards and O’Matz explain how McMahon and her advisers are reenvisioning the nation’s educational system and what that could mean for the future.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P8190482-700x525-1.jpg,,,2026-01-11 07:11:41.176244

(Photo by Tom Banse)The days might be numbered for your next Puget Sound ferry ride to be a fleeting offline oasis, free from the incessant demands of email, pop-up ads and doomscrolling. 
Washington State Ferries is yielding to requests from commuters for internet access, which the state Legislature heard and turned into an order for a Wi-Fi pilot project.
In a newly published report to the Legislature, the ferry system laid out its plans for a limited trial of free Wi-Fi at one terminal (Bremerton) and on one ferry, the Chimacum. Installation of antennas and routers is slated for this spring to facilitate a Wi-Fi test period during the summer.
Traveler demand and reviews, along with the availability of future state funding, will determine if a wider rollout happens. The ferry system offered pay-to-use Wi-Fi hotspots previously, but discontinued that partnership in 2016 due to poor performance and low uptake. 
“The public expects to have internet access,” Poulsbo Mayor Becky Erickson wrote in a letter to the head of Washington State Ferries more than a year ago. “For many individuals, internet access is crucial for carrying out their daily tasks efficiently. The absence of internet access on ferries or the Bainbridge Island terminal decreases productivity.”
Cellular data signals sometimes drop out in the middle of the Sound. WSF reported there are also dead zones around bends in Rich Passage on the Seattle-Bremerton route. The San Juan Islands also suffer from cell service dead zones.
The city manager of Bainbridge Island sent in a nearly identical letter after getting unanimous backing from the city council. Similar sentiments filtered up to the state Senate through Kitsap County’s legislators. The result was a 2025 transportation budget proviso that directed the ferry system to give public Wi-Fi another try.
“We do want people to be able to work from the boat if that’s important to them,” explained Senate Transportation Committee Chair Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, in an interview last week.
However, the legislative directive to the ferry system had a catch. It said to carry out the new Wi-Fi pilot project “within existing resources,” which meant no extra money. Thus, the cash-strapped agency told lawmakers this winter it had to focus the tryout on one terminal and one vessel.
“Bremerton is strategically selected because it represents one of the system’s longest sailings, where customer demand for internet connectivity is likely higher, and where the physical layout of the terminal provides a manageable platform for initial installation,” the WSF project outline said.
The ferry Chimacum was chosen not only because it serves Bremerton, but because it has a scheduled maintenance layup in March that aligns nicely to do the hotspot installation with minimal extra disruption.
Technology choices
Satellite-based internet provider Starlink is making rapid inroads with airlines and major cruise lines based on having stable and fast service. The Alaska Marine Highway System recently chose Starlink to provide internet connectivity on the ferry assigned to the Bellingham-Southeast Alaska route.
Starlink has a rising Washington-grown competitor in Amazon Leo, another satellite-based internet vendor. But neither of these two companies will be considered for the ferryboat Wi-Fi deployment on Puget Sound this year. 
“For the first phase of this pilot, we are focusing on cellular data connectivity rather than satellite-based internet. Cellular connectivity is significantly more cost-effective,” ferry system spokesman Justin Fujioka said in an email. “Satellite-based solutions, such as low-Earth orbit providers, may be evaluated in the future.”
Fujioka added that the state’s ferries are equipped with commercial-grade antennas that are more powerful than consumer mobile devices. That could give the onboard Wi-Fi network a leg up over your personal cellular data plan, but Fujioka said slowdowns or brief dropouts could still happen. The ferry system’s previous, ultimately unsatisfying onboard Wi-Fi provider Boingo relied on terrestrial cellular data too, a decade ago.
The deployment schedule provided to the Legislature calls for free Wi-Fi to debut in May and last through August. In September, ferry workers expect to crunch the data on customer usage, technical performance and reliability.
Then they will toss the ball back to management and legislators to decide whether Wi-Fi will be offered permanently, and if so, whether to expand it across more terminals and vessels. A permanent Wi-Fi offering would not necessarily be free of charge. It could be tiered or subscription-based, WSF said.
A key legislator who holds sway over the ferry system budget said the estimated multi-million dollar price tag to roll out Wi-Fi systemwide caught his eye. State House Transportation Committee Chair Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, sounded skeptical about greenlighting big spending for new internet infrastructure and ongoing operational costs in light of all the other needs the beleaguered ferry system has.
“Given that it didn’t work before, I don’t think this would rate” for future funding, Fey said in an interview. “If this came back as uncertain that it would be profitable or break even, I would say another day, not now.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ferry-Chimacum-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-11 07:11:41.176244

Cindy Hyde-Smith?,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/11/democrats-hyde-smith/,"President Donald Trump embraces Sen.

One variation of an old saying goes, “If ifs and ands were pots and pans, there’d be no work for tinkers,” and another goes, “If a frog had wings he wouldn’t bump his backside when he jumps.”
Those sayings are meant to dissuade people from hypothesizing about an event that is not likely to happen.
They are adages for a reason. They hold elements of truth.
Despite the warnings established by those adages, it is still worth noting that if the Mississippi electorate follows the pattern established by voters in other states in recent elections – even in solidly Republican areas – the Mississippi contest for the U.S. Senate later this year could be closer than expected.
Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, a close ally of President Donald Trump, is a heavy favorite to win reelection this November and continue serving in the nation’s Capitol as Mississippi’s junior senator. Heck, a Democrat has not won a statewide election in Mississippi since Jim Hood garnered reelection as attorney general in 2015.
But in 10 special elections, granted district elections not state contests, held across the country since Dec. 9, Democrats have performed on average 13% better than they did in the previous elections in those same districts.
Even in statewide elections – gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia – the Democrat did better in 2025 than in the previous election in 2021– by 9.4% in Virginia and by 5.6% in New Jersey.
If (there is that word) the Democrat running against Hyde-Smith could do as well this November, the election would be exceedingly close and she could even lose.
In her last election in 2020, she defeated Democrat Mike Espy 54% to 44%. When the pair ran against each other in a special election in 2018 months after Hyde-Smith had been appointed to temporarily fill the Senate seat, Espy garnered 46.4% of the vote.

This time around, Lowndes District Attorney Scott Colom is the favorite to win the Democratic primary on March 10 and face Hyde-Smith in November. He faces opposition from Albert Littell and Priscilla W. Till. Hyde-Smith, for that matter, is being challenged in the Republican primary by Sarah Adlakha and Andrew Smith. 
Ty Pinkins, who has run for statewide office in the past as a Democrat, will be vying in the Senate contest in the November general election as an independent, creating an additional headwind for the Democratic nominee. 
Democrats have exceeded their performances in recent elections presumably because of voter disenchantment with Republican President Trump.

A key question is whether voters in Mississippi, where Trump has historically been popular, feel the same disenchantment?
Trump faces various headwinds right now. Many voters are still struggling with economic woes. Plus, Trump still faces questions concerning his closeness to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the fact that the U.S. Department of Justice seems to be violating the law to slow-walk the release of files that perhaps could shed light on that relationship. Then, there are questions about Trump’s strange obsession with controlling or acquiring other countries, even making threats of military action against longtime allies.
And there is always the issue of his inappropriate comments regarding the deaths of people he did not like. 
Will all of those issues and others impact elections in Mississippi, like they have affected elections in other states?
Heck, even in Mississippi, there was at least one recent special election where the Democrat did much better than in past contests.
In a Nov.10  special election in state Senate District 19 in northwest Mississippi, incumbent Kevin Blackwell won by only 6.6%. In the 2023 regular election, Blackwell won by a sizable margin of 31.4%. Granted, Blackwell ran in 2025 in a new court-ordered district that increased the percentage of Black voters, who tend to vote Democratic, but the increase was minimal from 25.4% to 27.5%.
If (there is that word again) those election trends hold true, Hyde-Smith could be in for a challenge this November.

Can we be friends?
Abigail Ulager, 16, Hinesburg
Why don’t we become friends?
We can carry one another through storms,
and catch each other when we fall.
The only thing is:
I’m weak,
and no matter how much I want to lift you up,
I don’t think I can.
Never mind that,
we can still be friends.
We can shine lights when the clouds hide the sun,
and show each other that the shadows aren’t all that scary after all.
I’m scared of your shadows too,
and I don’t know how to light up the darkness.
Maybe we can’t be friends… 
because what’s the point of doing something
if it’s not going to be any good?
But she, with brown hair,
twinkled her bright eyes.  
I don’t remember what she said
as she gently took my hand;
all I know is that she smiled 
like we would never die.
So maybe I can’t carry you across the raging ocean, 
or make the blackness white –
you’ll need someone else for that.
I’m no doctor, 
and I don’t know how to make your wounds hurt less.
But I will be here
with open ears and open arms,
because I don’t know how to make it better
but I have a shoulder on which you can cry
and a heart that yearns to laugh.
So, can we be friends?
I don’t have much to offer,
and will probably mess up a billion times.
But I really want to stand here,
my hands holding on to yours 
and yours resting in mine.

But inside, it is warm and welcoming, stocked with clothes, books, furniture, and more, donated by community members for others to take free of charge. (Photo by Aneri Pattani/KFF Health News)NEW ORLEANS — From the outside, the abandoned Family Dollar store in the Lower 9th Ward looks intimidating. It’s covered in graffiti, with aluminum cans and trash dotting the parking lot. It sits on a street with other empty lots and decayed buildings — symbols of the lasting devastation this neighborhood, one of the city’s poorest, has endured since Hurricane Katrina.
But inside, the store is a welcoming oasis. Twinkly string lights adorn racks of donated clothing. Shelves and bins overflow with children’s books, allergy medications, and toiletries. Curtains cordon off one side of the room, where there’s a stage for musicians and a neon sign depicting roller skates for weekly free skate nights.
The space is part free thrift store, part over-the-counter pharmacy, part punk show venue — and wholly “a radical community center,” said Dan Bingler, who runs the place.
Bingler is a waiter and bartender in the city who founded a mutual-aid organization called the Greater New Orleans Caring Collective. He said the building owners allow him to use the space as long as he pays the water, electricity, and trash bills.
On Monday evenings, volunteers from other community organizations show up — some used to set up in the parking lot before Bingler opened the store. They offer free testing for sexually transmitted infections, basic medical care, hot meals, and sterile syringes and other supplies for people who use drugs.
The purpose of the space is simple, Bingler said: “We’re going to make sure we provide for the community.”
Although it’s been open for a few years now, the space has become even more crucial to this community in recent months, with the Trump administration slashing funding for many social service organizations and taking an aggressive approach to homelessness and drug use. In Washington, D.C., the administration has bulldozed tents to push people living on the street to leave the city. Nationally, it has called for people who use drugs to be forced into treatment. It has decried harm reduction — practices that public health experts say keep people who use drugs safe and alive but that critics say promote illegal drug use.

The community space in New Orleans — named the Fred Hampton Free Store after the famous Black Panther activist known for bringing together diverse groups to fight for social reforms — aims to be a haven among this sea of changes.
 
It doesn’t receive federal funding, state or local grants, or money from foundations, Bingler said. It’s simply neighbors helping neighbors, he said, tearing up and adding, “It’s a really beautiful thing to be able to share all this space.”
All items inside are provided by people or organizations in the community. Bingler said one time a local hotel undergoing renovations donated 50 flat-screen TVs.
On nights the store is open, often more than 100 people visit, Bingler said.
One fall evening, dozens of people browsed for free clothing and over-the-counter medications. Others sat on the grass outside, chatting while keeping an eye on their bicycles or grocery carts full of possessions.
James Beshears stopped by the harm reduction group in the parking lot to get sterile supplies he uses to inject heroin and fentanyl. He said he’d been in treatment for years but relapsed after his doctor moved away and he was referred to a clinic that charged $250 a day. Street drugs were cheaper than treatment, he said.
He wants to stop. But until he can find affordable care, places like the free store keep him going. Without it, he said, he’d have “one foot in the grave.”
Another man in the parking lot was waiting for the arrival of Aquil Bey, a paramedic and former Green Beret well known for helping people overcome obstacles to getting health care. As soon as the man spotted Bey’s black Jeep, he ran up.
“I’ve got stage 4 kidney disease,” the man said, adding that he was scheduled for treatments at a hospital but was struggling to get there.
“Do me a favor,” Bey said as he unloaded folding tables and medical equipment from his car. “When our team gets here, come and see us. Maybe we can get you transportation.”
Bey is the founder of Freestanding Communities, a volunteer-run organization that provides free basic medical care and referrals for people who are homeless, using drugs, or part of other vulnerable communities. The group has a steady presence at the free store.
That day, Bey and his team connected the man needing kidney disease treatment to reduced-cost transit programs. They also did blood pressure and blood sugar checks for anyone who wanted them, cleaned infected wounds, and called clinics to make appointments for patients without phones.

A man with a leg injury mentioned he was sleeping on the concrete floor of an abandoned naval base. Bey noticed the free store’s furniture section had a mattress. He and another volunteer hauled it out, strapped it to the top of a car, and delivered it to where the man was sleeping.
 
“We’re just trying to find all these barriers” that people face and “find ways to fix them,” Bey said.
The clinic at the free store helped Stephen Wiltz connect with addiction care. He grew up in the Lower 9th Ward and had been using drugs since he was 10.
Fed up with discrimination from doctors who blamed him for his addiction, Wiltz said, he was reluctant to go to any treatment facility. But after years of knowing the volunteers at the free store, he trusted them to point him in the right direction.
At 56, Wiltz was in sustained recovery for the first time in his life, he said during a phone interview in the fall.
Those volunteers “cared for people who didn’t have nobody to care for them,” he said.
As the sun went down that fall evening at the store, a punk band started setting up for a show across the room from the medical clinic. Lights dimmed and music blared — a reminder that this was not your everyday clinic or community center.
Bey continued consulting with a patient who had gout.
“I get used to the sound,” Bey said of the rapid drums and loud power chords. “I like it sometimes.”

A viral video posted just after Christmas spurred an avalanche of news coverage, changes from the Trump administration, and congressional hearings that appeared to indicate that a massive trove of child care fraud was just uncovered in Minnesota.
Much of it has been misleading.
The video by right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley posted Dec. 26 purports to show that various Minneapolis day cares run by Somali Americans are not providing services to children despite receiving public funding. Although the video has already been debunked by investigators, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have seized on it. Vice President JD Vance said Shirley “has done far more useful journalism than any of the winners of the 2024 [Pulitzer Prizes].”
The fallout has been massive. In the past week, the Trump administration has frozen child care payments to five Democratic-run states and ramped up reporting requirements for all states receiving child care funds to cover services for the lowest-income kids. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, has suspended his reelection campaign over it.
But the real story behind child care fraud in Minnesota is far less nefarious.
Here’s what we actually know about child care fraud in Minnesota and elsewhere, and how day cares and families may be impacted by the new changes.
What does Nick Shirley uncover in his video?
Nothing conclusive. The video shows Shirley visiting day cares run by Somali Americans, sometimes under the false pretense of trying to enroll a child. In a couple of instances, workers do open the door but seem immediately suspicious when it’s clear Shirley is recording them and refuse to let him in or give him more information.
Because some of the sites appear closed and Shirley doesn’t see any children, he declares this as proof of fraud at these facilities.
Most child care centers are locked and have obscured doors or windows for children’s safety. Children are also kept in classrooms and would not likely be visible from a reception area. One of the day cares in the video told several news outlets that it did not grant Shirley entrance because he showed up with a handful of masked men, which raised suspicions that the men were agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. At least one of the centers was closed at the time Shirley arrived because it opens later in the day to serve the children of second-shift workers.

Is there a history of child care fraud in the state?
Yes, but it’s not as widespread as Shirley claims.
The federal government sends money to states to subsidize the cost of care for very low-income children, and some states put additional funds into that system. In Minnesota, it’s known as the Child Care Assistance Program, or CCAP. Centers that accept children on subsidies will bill the state for the cost of caring for those kids.
In 2019, a state investigation found that there was probably several million dollars in child care fraud taking place within that system, where centers were billing for children they were not providing services for. Investigators believed the level of child care fraud in the state was more than the $5 million to $6 million prosecutors had been able to prove until that point.
By 2019, state prosecutors had charged at least a dozen Minnesotans and centers with defrauding the state’s child care program in the prior five years.
After the 2019 report was issued, the state tightened oversight, including creating the Department of Children, Youth and Families to take over child care licensing, oversight and auditing. Last year, Minnesota passed a law to criminalize kickbacks for child care program enrollment referrals.
A 2025 report by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General found that issues with overpayments continue in the state. The inspector general sampled 1,155 child care centers and found that 11 percent of the payments made to those centers in 2023 had errors.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean there was fraud. Improper payments is an umbrella term that could include fraud.
For example, “an improper payment is a child was present for 40 hours and somehow the state paid only for 30 hours. Fraud is when you’re charging for kids that were never enrolled,” explained Danielle Ewen, a national child care expert.
An 11 percent rate puts Minnesota above the permissible 10% threshold established by the federal government, Ewen said. On average nationwide, the rate is 4%.
So while child care fraud is something Minnesota has been working to reduce in recent years, “these are not new issues, but they are being repackaged and they are being promoted in ways to make it seem like there is an epidemic,” said Elliot Haspel, a national child care expert, on a call with reporters this week.

Is there evidence of large-scale child care fraud nationwide?
No.
According to a 2020 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, only seven states since 2013 have had errors in more than 10 percent of their child care fund payments. That also does not mean there is necessarily fraud, but rather errors in overbilling.
The federal Office of Child Care did not respond to questions about The 19th about which states are above the threshold.
What did state investigators find when they investigated the day cares in the videos?
State investigators conducted unannounced visits at the day cares in the viral video over the past six months as part of the typical licensing and auditing process, according to Tikki Brown, the commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families. An analysis of publicly available inspection records by The 19th found that most of the centers had unannounced inspections as recently as October, November or December.
After the video was posted, investigators from the state Office of Inspector General conducted compliance visits to nine of the 10 centers in the video (one of the centers in the video has been closed for several years and has not received funds in that time). They found normal operations and children at all but one, which had not yet opened for the day. Further investigations are being conducted into four of the nine facilities, but the state has not said what exactly it’s investigating.
Most of the centers in the video did have numerous state licensing violations against them regarding cleanliness, staff supervision and some recordkeeping around immunizations and allergies. But none of the violations against the centers were regarding fraud, according to state enforcement records.
Quality Learning Center, the center most prominently featured in the video because one of its signs misspelled learning, closed this week. Another center in the video, Mako Childcare Center, has been closed since 2022, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said.
There is evidence of one of the day cares in the video having a connection to prior fraud investigations. Fowsiya Hassan, the CEO of Minnesota Best Childcare Center, previously owned another day care called Sunshine Child Care Center that was raided in 2022 as part of an overbilling fraud investigation. No charges were brought.
Hassan sued the state last year over the raid, which led to the closure of Sunshine, claiming “licensing and fraud investigations in Minnesota have long been disproportionately targeted against Somalis.”
How can I check if my child’s day care has been inspected and audited?
Every state is federally mandated to publicly report the results of inspections at licensed child care centers (including the dates of the inspections), and day cares are required to undergo at least one unannounced inspection a year. In Minnesota, that information can be found at the state’s Licensing Information Lookup tool.
To find information on your state, visit The 19th’s child care safety dashboard which has a link to each state’s dashboard of child care providers.
Why was the Somali community targeted?
David Hoch, the lobbyist and former right-wing candidate for Minnesota attorney general who serves as the main source in Shirley’s video, received information on the centers from Republican staffers in Minnesota.
Hoch has had a particular focus on the Somali community and fraud for some time. In a now-deleted Instagram account, Hoch posted almost exclusively about the Somali community, according to reporting in The Intercept.
“EVERY Somali in MN is engaged in fraud. ALL of them,” Hoch posted.  “Even the Blacks have had enough of the demon Muslims,” he said in November.
Over the years, whistleblowers alleged that the fraud money in Minnesota’s child care system was being used to fund the Somali terrorist organization al-Shabab. The 2019 Office of the Legislative Auditor investigation found those claims to be unsubstantiated.
The Somali community has been a particular target of President Donald Trump, who has claimed that “much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia.”
The president last month called Somali immigrants “garbage” who he doesn’t want in the country.
Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the United States, and child care has historically been an industry that employs large numbers of immigrants. About 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrant women.
Since Shirley’s video, there have been numerous reports of people harassing Somali-run day cares and businesses either through in-person visits demanding to see children, or through threatening phone calls. At least one center was broken into.
Day cares in Minnesota have reported concerns for children and staff safety, particularly as ICE activity in the state has ramped up.
Dawn Uribe, the owner of four Spanish-immersion preschools in Minnesota, said she “really can’t overstate how afraid” her all-immigrant staff is since the video was posted even though all have work authorization and most are citizens or permanent residents.
“We are really preparing for the next couple of weeks for people to be calling off [work] and not coming,” Uribe said.
What is the child care funding freeze and who is impacted by it?
After the video was released, the Trump administration announced a funding freeze to five Democratic-run states: Minnesota, California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. The freeze would stop federal child care funds from flowing to states to cover care for low-income children. It was also pausing $7.3 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which supports low-income families, in those five states.
The five states impacted sued the administration over the freeze arguing that withholding the funds from low-income and vulnerable families would cause “immediate and devastating impacts.” On Friday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release the funds while the case is pending.
Officials had previously said funds would be released “only when states prove they are being spent legitimately.”
In Minnesota, state officials had until Friday to provide additional documentation, including Social Security numbers for all of the estimated 23,000 children who receive child care funds in the state, to the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
The state has informed providers that it has “several months” of reserves to cover care for those children should federal funds be frozen, so child care centers and families have not been impacted directly.
It’s unclear what evidence the Trump administration had to justify freezing funds to California, Colorado, New York and Illinois. In a letter to Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Alex Adams, the assistant secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, said the Trump administration was “concerned by the potential for extensive and systemic fraud in Illinois” and added that it has reason to believe the state is “illicitly providing illegal aliens with CCDF benefits intended for American citizens and lawful permanent residents.”
Nationally, every state will also now have to submit additional documentation to access child care dollars, a process that could slow payments to centers and increase the risk of day cares cutting staff or limiting operations.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to comment on any of the questions from The 19th.
“For too long, Democrat-led states and Governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” he said in a statement. “Under the Trump Administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes.”
Are there other impacts from the freeze?
National child care experts said there is a lot of confusion around exactly what data the federal government is requiring states to submit, and whether it’s even data states have on hand to provide.
For providers and families, there is a lot of uncertainty on what happens next and whether a freeze could still occur.
Freezing child care funding can lead day cares to cut staff, close classrooms or close entirely because many don’t have reserves to continue operations. During the government shutdown at the end of 2025, for example, numerous Head Start child care programs that rely on federal funding closed in at least 13 states.
Kylie Cooper, a director of a child care center in the Twin Cities, said that the families who face the most uncertainty are those with the fewest resources if their child care options fall through.
“These are the families who absolutely need [it],” she said. “They likely don’t have PTO or benefits in place with their employers if they have to take a day off work for child care. There’s not a support system.”
About 95 percent of the families who receive assistance in her program are headed by single mothers.
“If that freeze were to go into effect there are a whole lot of centers that run on a very thin margin and most of their kids are CCAP,” Cooper said. “They would last less than a month before they’re closing their doors.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The two candidates most likely to be Colorado’s next governor shared a stage for the first time at a union hall Saturday just north of Denver, addressing a crowd of Democrats eager to hear about the party’s path forward under President Donald Trump’s second administration.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, both Democrats, took questions from moderators and audience members in a forum hosted by the Colorado Young Democrats at the headquarters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 68.
Bennet began the event by acknowledging Renee Good, the Colorado-born woman who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday, sparking protests around the state and nation. Weiser called Good’s killing a “painful reminder” of what can happen “when we fail to train officers for the work they need to do safely.”

In their first face-to-face appearance ahead of the June 30 primary for governor, both Democrats promised to stand up to Trump and make Colorado a more affordable place to live.
“We are living at a momentous time in Colorado history and American history,” Bennet said. “We are living at a time when we have some of the worst income inequality and wealth inequality that we’ve seen as a nation in a hundred years, and your generation is going to bear the cost of that, if we don’t act quickly to deal with it.”
“I’m here as the child and grandchild of Holocaust survivors, liberated by U.S. soldiers, who made a decision to come to America and build a life for themselves, to get union jobs and opportunity,” Weiser said. “And that’s what I want for everyone here.”
Heavily favored
But the two candidates sparred repeatedly over their differences in approach throughout their 30 minutes onstage together. Weiser criticized Bennet’s votes in favor of several Trump Cabinet nominees and a super PAC supporting Bennet’s campaign that has received donations from billionaires and dark money groups.
“Colorado and America want fighters — people who meet the moment,”  said Weiser, who touted the 50 lawsuits his office has filed against the Trump administration since last January. “And I’ve shown as attorney general what that looks like.”
Bennet twice objected to being “lectured” by Weiser about resisting Trump, dismissing the attorney general’s raft of legal actions against the administration — many of which are brought jointly by the attorneys general of numerous Democratic-led states — as “signing on to other people’s lawsuits.”
“My opponent spends a lot of time talking about — fight, fight, fight, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit,” Bennet said. “But what we really need in this nation, in addition to fighting Trump, is a vision for what the future is going to look like.”
Weiser, a former law professor, is serving his second term as attorney general after he was first elected in 2018.
Bennet is a former Denver Public Schools superintendent who was appointed to the Senate by Gov. Bill Ritter in 2009. He ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020 before winning reelection to a third full term in 2022.
The winner of the primary between Weiser and Bennet will be heavily favored to win the general election in November. Coloradans have only elected one Republican governor in the last 50 years. Democrats have won every statewide election held in the last eight years by an average of more than 10 percentage points, and are widely expected to gain ground in a favorable midterm election year.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is term-limited.

That’s one of the few areas of bipartisan consensus left in a state that sometimes feels as polarized as the rest of the country. 
But every year — especially the ones when their name is on the ballot — the state’s elected officials and candidates flock to tiny Gillett in southeast Arkansas for its annual Coon Supper. They join hundreds of people in a school gymnasium to eat the mammal. Or at least the politicians pretend to.
“I think that’s kind of the strategy,” conceded Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who began attending the annual event when the state was considered solidly blue. “You brag about eating coon, but you don’t say when you ate it.”
When asked whether he enjoyed eating raccoon meat, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe said: “No, but I ate it. Because you were expected to.”
The supper is one of those quirks of Arkansas politics that’s somehow stood the test of time. In an era where retail politicking is replaced with six-figure ad buys and dueling messages on X, it’s one of the few truly required stops left for the state’s politicians. 
You can skip a debate or two, you can miss a festival, but God help you if you don’t make time for this supper.
That was certainly the case on Saturday night, as hundreds packed the gymnasium for this year’s supper. Rows of tables were filled with attendees _ including a few wearing raccoon skin hats _ who sat down to help themselves to the titular main course, as well as brisket, sweet potatoes and rice. Politicians on hand included Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton and Hallie Shoffner, who’s running for the Democratic nomination to challenge him this year.
Technically, the dinner is a nonpolitical event. Officeholders can speak, but non-officeholders cannot. That’s at least on the official program. 
Once a fundraiser for high school athletics, the event now raises money for college scholarships. Gillett High School is no longer open, but the school’s gymnasium is still used for the dinner.
The political lore surrounding the supper is legendary. Former President Bill Clinton often tells the tale about crash-landing in an airplane with the late Sen. Dale Bumpers on the way to the supper. The two arrived at the supper unharmed, and thus a favorite political story was born.
During 2014’s multimillion-dollar Senate fight between then-incumbent Mark Pryor and challenger Tom Cotton, the Gillett event drew swarms of national media. Pryor brought several Senate colleagues, including Dick Durbin of Illinois and Angus King of Maine. 
Glasses with the event’s familiar black-and-orange logo are a badge of honor for the state’s politicos and reporters. I still have mine from the first one I attended 20 years ago, and a ballcap adorned with images of pawprints and a camouflage bill.
By the way, I ate raccoon at all three  suppers I’ve attended. It’s not something I’d recommend as part of one’s regular diet.
Proof that the author ate some of the raccoon meat served at this year’s event (Andrew DeMillo/Arkansas Advocate)
Beebe recounts how in his first political race, for the state Senate district that included Gillett, the incumbent he was challenging went to a party before the supper at the late Marion Berry’s home and saw nearly everyone in attendance wearing a Beebe campaign button.
The incumbent dropped out about a month after seeing that.
Berry, whose congressional district included Gillett, said he wouldn’t have had a political career if it weren’t for the supper.
Berry, who passed away in 2023, was known for the parties he would hold before the supper with friends and supporters. Attendees would mingle, enjoy their “adult beverages,” and munch on food that’s not normally considered roadkill.
Berry’s family members, friends and former aides now use the pre-party as a fundraiser for a public service scholarship in Berry’s name for Arkansas State University students. The event is now held at the Berry farm shop, a short drive from the supper. Signs from the late Berry’s congressional campaigns adorn the shop and are used to help visitors find the party.
“It’s just such a unique environment,” said Gabe Holmstrom, a former Berry staffer and one of the organizers of the pre-supper party. “It’s this metal farm shop in the middle of a bean field in early January and you just have all these folks showing up.”
The supper and pre-party event in many ways is a scene from a bygone era, though with modern flourishes that include participants taking selfies for social media.
There are still some semi-required stops for politicians around the state such as the Hope Watermelon Festival and the Slovak Oyster Supper, but the Coon Supper has seemed to withstand most of the changes in Arkansas politics.
Boozman said the decline in such gatherings is “emblematic” of a larger problem: fewer people going out to gather in person to meet at places like civic clubs.
“It’s sad these things are in decline now,” Boozman said.
Eating raccoon may not necessarily be the solution to that decline, but it at least shows there’s still traditions in Arkansas politics that will endure.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CoonSupper1-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-11 06:12:07.422820

Fourteen months after crashing at the 2024 Killington World Cup, the Burke Mountain Academy graduate turned most-winning Alpine racer in history is again ascending — just in time for her fourth Olympics.

The last time many Vermonters saw Mikaela Shiffrin, the Alpine ski racer was standing atop Killington’s Superstar trail, seemingly a minute away from scoring an unprecedented 100th World Cup win.
Then, figuratively and literally, she went downhill fast.
The Burke Mountain Academy graduate had snagged the lead in the first of two giant-slalom runs on Nov. 30, 2024, only to follow up by slipping, somersaulting and slamming into a fence 12 seconds from the finish line.
Some 20,000 spectators went silent as the two-time Olympic gold medalist was rushed away on a rescue sled. They and 2 million national television viewers wouldn’t learn more until the skier took to Instagram at dusk from the nearby Rutland Regional Medical Center.
“I am so sorry to scare everybody,” Shiffrin said in a selfie video as she revealed an abdominal wound with a playful “ay, ay, ay.”
Fourteen months later, the 30-year-old is again on the rise in advance of next month’s Winter Olympics in Italy. Commentators point to her opening five-race winning streak this World Cup season. People with closer ties add that just returning to competition was a feat in itself.
“She’s been the best in the world for a long time, but given everything that has happened, to stay there is one of her most impressive accomplishments,” says Willy Booker, head of Shiffrin’s alma mater in the Northeast Kingdom.
Shiffrin graduated from the grade 8-12 ski school in 2013, the same year she became the youngest U.S. woman (at 17) to win a slalom world championship. Moving on to the Olympics, she scored slalom gold in 2014 and giant slalom gold and Alpine combined silver in 2018. A year later, she became the first skier to claim World Cup victories in all six disciplines — slalom, giant slalom, parallel slalom, alpine combined, super-G and downhill.
Booker, a onetime competitor himself, was at Killington on the 2024 Thanksgiving weekend when Shiffrin rocketed through the first of two runs of the giant slalom — a race down and around a series of gates — sparking the crowd to buzz about a potential new peak: a never-before-seen 100th World Cup win.

“It was amazing, building towards this crescendo,” Booker recalls of the anticipation.
Come the second round, NBC sportscasters spoke of especially icy course conditions just before Shiffrin launched from the start at 50 mph.
“She’s nervous, she’s a little bit stiff, and why would you not be?” commentator Picabo Street said on air. “But she’s forward, she’s leaning into it.” 
That’s when Shiffrin slipped, struck two gates, lost a ski, slammed into a fence and went scarily still — all in five seconds.

“Nobody knew how bad it was,” Booker remembers of the sudden hush.
Medics transported Shiffrin about 15 miles west to Rutland Regional Medical Center, where hospital spokespeople maintained patient confidentiality even as the athlete and her crew set up cameras in the emergency room.
Shiffrin posted on social media that night, then appeared on NBC from Killington the next day.
“We’re just not totally sure how I got punctured,” she told viewers of the stab wound that missed perforating her colon by millimeters. “Very lucky to not have worse injuries.”
But Shiffrin added that it hurt to breathe, let alone move — similar to how she felt after the accidental death of her 65-year-old father in 2020 and her failure to medal after three falls in the 2022 Olympics.
After Killington, some would sit out the rest of the season, especially with the concluding world championships less than 10 weeks away. But Shiffrin was determined to return, even after fluid buildup and infection-signaling fever and chills forced her into surgery two weeks later.
Developing a step-by-step rehabilitation plan, the skier focused first on simply standing, then walking, then easy exercises and, after four weeks, stepping into ski boots and snow.
Two months after her crash, Shiffrin raced the World Cup slalom in Courchevel, France, on Jan. 30, 2025, finishing a seemingly confidence-building 10th. But she continued to struggle off the course, seeing occasional flashes of imagined stumbles and spills.
A therapist viewed the visions as signs of post-traumatic stress disorder before sharing words from the late children’s television star Mister Rogers: “What’s mentionable is manageable.” And so Shiffrin expanded her recovery efforts from body to mind.
“A lot of it is trust that with time and practice and exposure, clarity will come back,” the athlete recalled in a recent self-produced video series, “Moving Right Along,” on her YouTube channel.
Shiffrin went on to ski at the February world championships in Saalbach, Austria, placing fifth in the slalom and helping the U.S. team win a combined event. She capped the month a week later in Sestriere, Italy, by finally scoring her 100th World Cup victory.
Since then, Shiffrin has increased her World Cup total to 106. Students and staff at Burke Mountain Academy are set to watch her attempt to add to her medal count at next month’s Olympics.
“There is a huge amount of pride,” Booker says. “They go to the same school as the greatest ski racer of all time.”
One who has little else to prove — yet, in her estimation, still more to gain.
“I’ve been doing this for a while, but I’m still learning new things,” Shiffrin concluded in her video series. “There’s new exciting adventures always just around the corner, and I’m looking forward to seeing what’s next.”

Isa Harrington, a South Burlington High School student, is a firm believer in the democratic process — even though she hasn’t had a chance to exercise her rights to the fullest extent yet, as she is only 17.
Still, the right to vote has been heavy on her mind since the summer months, when she joined the Governor’s Institute at Champlain College, which gave her some firsthand experience into just how powerful youth action can be. So powerful that a bill, spearheaded by Harrington and the student group, set to hit the House floor this legislative session is, for the first time in the state, attempting to give student representatives on school boards a binding vote on issues that come before the elected body.
Although the idea may be new to the state, it’s not entirely unheard of in the country, said Rep. Leanne Harple, D-Glover, a member of the House Committee on Education, who plans to sponsor the proposed legislation this session.
“In Maryland, eight of the state’s 24 local school districts have student board members with the right to cast votes,” she said. “This is not completely new territory that the students just made up.”
Harrington is heavily involved in school happenings, especially as a member of the student council. She says that although opportunities are available for students to become involved, it can, at times, seem more like an illusion of power.
“Student voice just doesn’t have as much power as it should when it comes to making decisions regarding education,” Harrington said. “It’s really hard to make policy that is for the students if you don’t have student input on what is necessary. And so often, what happens is there are policies that are being enacted that are focusing on the wrong priorities.”
The South Burlington School Board has historically had two student representatives, a junior and a senior from the high school, to represent the student body on the board. While those seats had never been able to cast a vote — even a non-binding one — this year, senior Ally Leduc and junior Momin Waqar, broached the topic with the board, who ultimately agreed to allow the students to cast a non-binding vote on issues.
But Waqar and Leduc explained that even having this added responsibility of taking an unofficial vote has added a new level of seriousness to their roles. Being a student representative is a hefty time commitment, and Waqar noted that having a binding vote in the future could add even more time commitments.
“If we’re also given a binding vote, then it’s our responsibility to be on top of that work, to stay informed on everything we’re voting on,” Waqar said. “Even when we got our non-binding vote, it was a really important conversation we had about being able to abstain from the vote if you’re not fully aware of what’s going on.”
Overall, both students agree that having a binding vote could be a step in the right direction to bring student perspective into the conversation, but details still need to be fleshed out before the duo takes a firm stance on the issue. They are, however, putting a lot of thought into both sides of the debate — as any responsible representative would.
Harrington touted Waqar and Leduc as excellent representations of the student body, but said their dedication is only one small glimpse into how passionate students are becoming about cultural, social and political issues — especially ones that affect their education.
“What you’re seeing more recently is that students are turning out,” she said. “You’re seeing an increase in young people who are participating in protests, getting engaged with their school boards, with their communities. They’re taking these steps to be involved. And that’s super important in general, to having a community, a country, a state, where everyone feels that their voice is being represented. It’s kind of foundational.”
The student body is, after all, the future, Harrington said. And that’s a responsibility she doesn’t take lightly. But she isn’t naive about the fact that others may not have the same ideas as she does, and for her, that’s OK, because that’s also part of the democratic process. She just hopes this opens more doors for students to have a seat at that table.
She noted that the conversation is especially timely given the current landscape of Vermont’s public education system. New legislation passed last year has promised that how schools are funded and governed is going to change in the coming years.
“I think helping create this platform for myself to prove that it was possible has made a whole world of difference in increasing the conviction I already had that it is so important for students to be able to make these changes,” Harrington said.
The bill, still in early draft form, dictates that school district boards include voting student members in grades nine, 10, 11 and 12 and non-voting members in grades seven and eight. The appointment would be overseen by the superintendent of the district through a process outlined by the given school board.
Harple, who is also a teacher at Hazen Union High School, noted that while she has heard from some legislators about an interest in co-sponsoring the bill, she is aware that there is likely to be some pushback.
But the ethos of the effort itself is worth it.
“This was legislation that students came up with, where they identified a problem, that they didn’t think they had a strong enough voice and huge decisions that are being made right now are affecting the future of their education,” Harple said. “And when asked to find a solution, they came up with the solution. And I was like, ‘That’s actually not a bad idea. I’m going to see it through.’ And that itself is a reason to see this through, that students are doing this work. We should help them see if they can get this into law.”

It’s one example of shifts in Congress he’s dealt with.","In a year filled with power struggles between Congress and the White House, Jim Himes is one of the small group of lawmakers who have felt the brunt of it.
That came into stark relief last weekend after the U.S. strike on Venezuela and the capture of its president. As a high-ranking official on the House Intelligence Committee, Himes is one of the “Gang of Eight” who traditionally get some of the earliest information about major military operations.
Yet he was left in the dark for days.
So Himes, who represents Connecticut’s 4th District in the southwestern portion of the state, has had to learn to navigate not only the challenges of serving in the Democratic minority but also in a Congress that the executive branch increasingly bypasses on some military and federal spending issues, despite Congress’ constitutional authority.
But despite the Venezuela snub, the Democratic minorities in Congress and the broader challenges to democracy here and abroad, Himes says he’s still in the game and still able to wield power as a top Democrat on a key committee. 
That’s partly because the sands are slowly shifting in Washington.
Back in January 2025, “that was a pretty defeated moment, and almost all the Republicans were 100% Donald Trump,” Himes said in an interview from his Washington, D.C., office last week. “That’s changed, partly because of the result of the November elections.”
“So politics is back because Republicans know that if they are unquestioning in their support of Donald Trump, they’re going to get shellacked” in the midterm elections this fall, he said. 
‘Dangerous and unprecedented’
Himes went into the past year with some expectations of how President Donald Trump might operate in his second term, given his experiences the last time. But that has looked different, he said, with the vast expansion of executive powers. He argued the current administration has taken it to a “dangerous and unprecedented place.”
“A lot of this stuff is just picking up a baseball bat and hitting yourself in the head,” he said, running through a list of threats Trump has made regarding other countries in the wake of Venezuela. “We get nothing for that, and it hurts us.”
When Himes was preparing for Trump to take office almost a year ago, he devised a system of when to engage and decipher what was serious and what was just rhetorical bluster. At the time, he wrote off Trump’s comments about Greenland, calling it “obvious nonsense.”
Given Trump’s repeated overtures about the autonomous island that’s part of Denmark, the congressman said, he’s coming around to the plausibility of it becoming a reality, even as some downplay or rebuff the possibility of taking Greenland by military force.
Himes sees his job through different lenses, with varying degrees of interference. On the issues that are more Connecticut-specific — transportation and infrastructure chief among them — he said they’re “grinding away pretty well,” even with issues like the stop-work order at Revolution Wind. But from the vantage point of national security — the bulk of his job in D.C. — it’s “much more of a mixed bag.”
If you as a citizen decide that this is a Yankees-Red Sox game and the other side is evil and treasonous and seditious and you are the sole arbiter of truth, we’ll have an authoritarian government.U.S. Rep. Jim Himes
Serving in the minority party typically comes with its limitations, especially with Republicans’ political trifecta of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Yet the GOP’s narrow majorities means they need to take Democrats into account, given their votes are needed on most legislation, particularly in the Senate.
While some elements of his job involving intelligence matters have been hindered, other things haven’t changed as he had anticipated at the start of 2025. And he still feels like he’s able to assert himself.
“I don’t feel like I have no effect. And I worried about that a year ago. Republicans can’t ignore Democrats entirely,” Himes said, whether it’s on an annual defense policy bill or appropriations. “So I don’t feel irrelevant on a lot of things.”
The role of the Intelligence Committee
Because of his prominent role in Congress, Himes has repeatedly found himself at the forefront of major foreign policy matters with wide-ranging implications.
As a member of the “Gang of Eight,” a group of the Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate plus the chairs and ranking members of both intelligence committees, Himes typically gets a heads-up on major military actions.
The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has oversight over U.S. intelligence agencies as well as some issues concerning the Pentagon and other government agencies. He’s served on that committee since 2013 and was elevated to ranking member in 2023.

But for Democratic leaders who are usually privy to such information, Himes said, he hadn’t received any communication from White House officials in the days since the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife until the Monday evening briefing with the Gang of Eight.
Lawmakers pushed back on the administration for not notifying Congress before the attack. But Trump officials defended the decision, saying it could have compromised the operation and put U.S. troops at risk. That has become more common of presidential administrations, led by both Democrats and Republicans. One recent example is former President Barack Obama not seeking congressional authorization or providing Congress a heads-up before bombing Libya in 2011.
“Presidents of both parties have long relied on their constitutional authority to act when foreign actors pose a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States and its people. President Trump did exactly that,” the Connecticut Republican Party said in a statement after the capture of Maduro, specifically naming Himes and a few other Connecticut Democrats for “playing politics.”
This wasn’t the first time Himes learned of significant military action through other channels.
When the U.S. launched strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran last June, Himes learned of the news through social media.
It was nearly déjà vu last weekend. Himes told NPR’s “Morning Edition” his wife woke him up on last Saturday, saying, “You won’t believe what’s happening.”
While he has said it was successful as a military and tactical mission, Himes called it “illegal” and “unwise.” And after sitting in on briefings, it was clear to him that officials had no plans for what to do after. 
But from a morality standpoint, it’s a bit more nuanced, because Maduro is a “bad, bad guy.”
As the administration maps out its next moves in the region, officials like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth have defended their approach.
“Our military is prepared to continue this,” Hegseth told reporters after Wednesday’s Venezuela briefings with all members of Congress. “The president, when he speaks, he means it. He’s not messing around. We are an administration of action to advance our interests, and that is on full display.”
In his own words, Trump made it clear how he views the limitations of his own powers, particularly abroad.

“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” Trump said in an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday.
Even so, Himes said, he’s had small victories, particularly in the intelligence community — including some he can’t discuss, given the classified nature of the job. He said he helped add a measure into the National Defense Authorization Act that supported the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump’s administration has been skeptical of NATO, and the alliance faces a potential crisis if the U.S. seizes Greenland. 
Himes’ role in it all
When it comes to Congress’ war powers, Himes acknowledged that administrations led by both parties have been chipping away at that for years.
In defending Trump, Republicans argued that Democrats didn’t take issue when their own party had taken unilateral action, like when the Obama administration intervened in Libya in 2011. At the time, Himes voted to limit further military action in the region.
“The other thing as a member of Congress that is really irritating is that we’re a participant in the now 100-year-long argument over who gets to approve the commitment of our troops,” Himes said. “Now the Constitution to me is pretty clear, but to be fair, we’ve had this argument with presidents of both parties.” 
But he argued the Trump administration has taken that to a new level.
That has left him to reflect on his role as a member of Congress and as a top member of the intelligence committee — even in more hyperbolic terms.

“In looking at the administration’s planned intelligence activities, I’ve had deep moral qualms, and I have expressed those, and I think I’ve had some effect on altering programs in ways that are not to my satisfaction but at least move, in my opinion, those programs in the right direction,” Himes said.
When speaking at the Connecticut Mirror’s “In the Room” event back in April, he mused about whether he’d need to break the law by speaking publicly about classified information, if it meant holding the administration accountable, in extreme circumstances. The hypothetical scenario he gave at the time was if Trump mobilized the CIA to target an American within the country.
He stands by the comments he made but said there’s a blurred line because “you got to think about policy disagreements differently than you think about clear moral stands.”
“If you had something that was legal and profoundly immoral, I’d be like ‘OK, what do I do?’ Himes said. “And in some ways, that’s the failsafe, right? If the administration, which I think has been authoritarian and beyond the pale, if it spun in a far darker direction, I would not be looking to compromise with that.”
Over the past year, Himes has mused about a democracy sliding closer to authoritarian system. Himes said it’s incumbent on everyone, including Democrats, to figure out why some Americans are turning away from it.
“It’s in dramatic retreat in the United States, and it’s in retreat all over the world,” Himes said. “That’s a belief that democracy is not providing for them. And we have some self-soul-searching to do in that regard.”
“If you as a citizen decide that this is a Yankees-Red Sox game and the other side is evil and treasonous and seditious and you are the sole arbiter of truth,” he said, “we’ll have an authoritarian government.” 
Small shifts in Congress
Trump is at the end of the first year of his second term, but Himes sees the tide slowly turning with elections on the horizon. That has given the self-described optimist some glimmers of hope — among them, those sporadic moments when Republicans have been more willing to buck the president.
To Himes, it’s a byproduct of the election cycle.
Last week, Congress pushed back repeatedly at the White House as it sought to reassert itself on policy fronts and matters of national security.
For example, the GOP-controlled Senate gave a rare rebuke of Trump as it voted for a war powers resolution to rein in Trump on Venezuela. Under that bill, Trump would need approval from Congress before further engaging in military action in the region.
And nearly a dozen House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the revival of lapsed pandemic-era enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, as Trump has given mixed messaging on how to proceed with health care. 
On the same day, the House sought to override Trump’s vetoes on bills with overwhelming support, although those efforts fell short, with enough Republicans blocking the effort.
But Himes isn’t shy about criticizing his own party, which he says still needs to learn “how to center the core concerns” of Americans, such as the cost of living. Or that Trump shoulders the blame for everything.
Himes said the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under former President Joe Biden did “jack shit” for his southwestern Connecticut district.
“Shame on us,” Himes said. “That’s not Donald Trump’s fault.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25343796500718-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-11 05:11:42.392488
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-11 09:55:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PAID POST: 2025 Marked Real Mental Health Progress in Connecticut. But Access Gaps Are Still Widening.,Christian Damiana,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/11/paid-post-2025-marked-real-mental-health-progress-in-connecticut-but-access-gaps-are-still-widening/,"After a landmark year for Connecticut mental health reform, families still report widespread insurance and access barriers. New data highlights the urgent need for parity enforcement and stronger networks.","When Gov. Ned Lamont signed Connecticut’s bipartisan behavioral health parity bill on July 10, he framed it as part of a broader shift toward treating mental and physical health equally. He also acknowledged that families still face steep barriers when trying to use their insurance for behavioral health care, including high out-of-pocket costs or too few in-network providers. “Physical health and mental health are one and the same,” Lamont said at the signing. “And we’re going to make sure our insurance companies remember that every day.”
The announcement capped what many advocates say was the most active year for mental health legislation in more than five years. In addition to the parity bill, Lamont appointed the state’s first Behavioral Health Advocate and, during a special session in November, legislators approved a wide-ranging children’s behavioral health bill.
But new data shows that even as the state strengthens oversight, demand for care is rising sharply. According to the CT Parity Coalition’s recent State of Mental Health in Connecticut report, 689,000 adults — five times the population of Stamford — experienced a mental illness in 2024, and the state’s youth mental health ranking fell from second in the nation to 21st in a single year. School administrators, clinicians, and community providers have all reported increased need, particularly among adolescents.
Affordability and insurance barriers remain a major obstacle
The State of Mental Health in Connecticut report also noted that more than 77,000 Connecticut adults could not see a doctor due to cost, despite needing mental health treatment. Residents were four times more likely to be forced out-of-network for mental health care than for primary care, a pattern that advocates say reflects limited in-network provider availability and other longstanding parity issues.
Providers report similar challenges playing out in real time. In testimony earlier this year, one clinician described contacting “at least 27 in-network providers, only to find that none was accepting new patients.” With no available options, she said, a child remained in a higher level of care longer than clinically necessary at great cost to the family.

What parity is — and why enforcement matters now
These access barriers point to a system that is improving –– slowly. And not nearly fast enough to match growing treatment needs. State officials say the new parity law is designed to help close that gap.
Parity is a simple idea with far-reaching implications: mental health and substance use care must be treated the same as physical health care. That means equal coverage, equal access to in-network providers, and equal protection from delays or denials. Fundamentally, arity is the opposite of disparity. Connecticut’s reforms aim to turn parity from a legal requirement into a lived reality for families.
For years, regulators said they lacked the tools to enforce that principle. Until October 1, the maximum an insurer could be fined for a violation was $15,000, an amount advocates noted was negligible for large national carriers tracking tens of billions of dollars in annual profits. Under the 2025 reforms, the state Insurance Commissioner can now fine insurers up to $625,000 annually.
Lamont has emphasized that enforcement must be a priority, signaling that the state intends to use these new authorities.
“We’re going to enforce this. We’re going to make sure there is mental health parity… [the Commissioner of Insurance is] going to enforce this and hold people accountable and make sure our fines are allocated,” he said during the signing.
Connecticut’s next major inflection point will come when the Insurance Department completes its annual parity review, expected this spring. It may mark the first significant action in several years, at a time when other states are already responding aggressively. In September, Delaware fined UnitedHealthcare $450,000 for parity violations. In August, Georgia issued $20 million in fines against health insurers for widespread noncompliance.

Looking ahead
The Connecticut Parity Coalition, a statewide alliance of more than 25 clinician and advocacy organizations, has been tracking these challenges for years. Members say that while 2025 marked a turning point, the next phase of work must focus on ensuring patients can actually access the care they’re entitled to.
“Coverage is only meaningful if people can use it,” said one coalition member. “We finally have the tools. Now we need to make sure they work.”
State officials and advocates agree that Connecticut’s progress in 2025 lays a strong foundation for the years ahead. But many say the next test will be whether the administration follows through on the Governor’s commitment to robust enforcement, and whether insurers adjust their practices in response. With rising need, workforce strain, and administrative barriers, the work is far from over.
As Gov. Lamont said at the signing: “It’s great passing bills, but the bill’s got to be real. The bill’s got to make a difference.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Picture1.jpg,,,2026-01-11 04:57:50.574527

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)What happened after a judge expressed displeasure with the presence of ICE agents in her municipal courtroom last month was yet another sign that our democracy is fraying.
But it wasn’t the judge at fault. It was the heavy-handed response from the state’s top federal prosecutor, who accused the judge of improper conduct and warned city employees not to interfere with or even “disparage” federal immigration officers.
You may have missed this story from Manhattan, Kansas, because it broke on New Year’s Eve, when many of us were celebrating the death of 2025. Barely three days later, we sobered up to the news that our military had struck Venezuela to snatch an alleged drug criminal and his wife and import them to the United States.
But the judicial dustup that began at the Municipal Court building on Colorado Street in the Little Apple may say more about American democracy at ground level than the Maduro affair.
On Dec. 4, Magistrate Judge Sarah Smith Barr paused her opening remarks in a hearing against a woman accused of DUI and leaving the scene of an accident to look at the ICE agents and tell them they “should not be there.” That’s according to reporting by the Manhattan Mercury, which quoted a letter to the city from Ryan Kriegshauser, the U.S. attorney for Kansas.
From the reporting, it was unclear how Barr knew the pair were with ICE.
The plainclothes agents followed the woman out of the courtroom and arrested her in a hallway after the hearing, the letter said. Barr identified the pair as ICE agents to the 20 to 25 people remaining in the courtroom.
Kriegshauser’s letter accused Barr of improperly injecting political overtones into the proceeding and said her remarks were “inappropriate and potentially dangerous,” according to the newspaper. Suggesting ICE agents had no business attending municipal court hearings was improper, the letter said. It was within the discretion of agents to attend public court hearings in seeking lawful arrests and removal of “illegal aliens.”
The letter did not name the woman whom the ICE agents arrested.
The Mercury noted there was no record of what was said in the courtroom at the time of the hearing and that Barr declined comment. The paper also examined the court docket for Dec. 4. It listed 53 individuals, but none was a woman charged with drunk driving and leaving the scene of an accident. Neither the court nor Kriegshauser’s office would identity the woman, the newspaper said.
Barr did not respond to a message from me asking about the hearing. But assuming Kriegshauser’s letter is accurate, Barr’s action falls short of what judges in other states have been disciplined for. A Wisconsin judge who had helped a Mexican migrant dodge ICE agents by allowing her to slip out through a side door was found guilty of obstruction last month. A Massachusetts judge who was accused of helping a migrant evade ICE in 2018 was the subject of a federal indictment and a state ethics complaint.
Federal prosecution of state or local judges is rare, and when it does happen it’s typically been associated with bribery. A bribery scandal rocked the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 1965, for example, set off by a confession from the former chief justice, imprisoned for tax evasion, that he and others had taken bribes amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars for the past 25 years. In the era of Trump, attention has been redirected to “activist judges,” especially in states where sanctuary laws are in tension with federal immigration policies.
But Kansas is not a sanctuary state. In 2022, a law aimed by the Legislature at the Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City’s “Safe and Welcoming City Act” went into effect, banning sanctuary cities statewide.
During the first Trump administration, immigration agents started making arrests at courthouses, which had been long recognized, along with churches and other sacred areas, as “protected spaces.” Courthouse arrests were again prohibited under the Biden administration, but after Trump took office for his second term, in January 2025, Department of Homeland Security policy on courthouses was steadily rolled back, although a federal injunction kept some restrictions on places of worship. Local ICE field offices may now use their discretion to conduct immigration enforcement in and around courthouses.
Thus, many ICE arrests are made at immigration courts across the country, including in Kansas City, Missouri, where individuals are detained and then deported after showing up for what they believe is a routine immigration hearing. Although migrants are guaranteed due process by the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to conduct lightning deportations largely unfettered by concerns about rights or racial profiling. With a budget of $28 billion, ICE is now the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the U.S. government.
The weight of this massive immigration enforcement machine was felt in Judge Barr’s municipal courtroom in December when the pair of ICE agents appeared. The agency is fond of courthouse captures because the location of their targets is known with a high degree of confidence and, because of security at courthouses, few are likely to carry weapons.
The problem is that courtrooms are meant to be safe and impartial places. The presence of ICE agents at a hearing they are not a part of introduces the very element of “political overtones” for which Kriegshauser criticized Barr. It would spark a range of emotions, from approval to fear, likely to disrupt the decorum of the court, if not derail the intended purpose of the proceeding. For that reason alone, Barr was correct in objecting.
The judge apparently did not obstruct agents by attempting to hustle the defendant out a side door or otherwise interfere with the arrest. To note one’s professional and ethical displeasure, as Barr did, is not “disparagement.” The message Kriegshauser sent with his letter was a warning to shut up or else.
The question of justice in a free society is, by necessity, eternally unanswered. To ask the nature of justice is to admit that there is still injustice to be addressed. Attempting to define justice is the realm of philosophers who have devoted careers to exploring the weave of democracy, justice and free societies.
“If a just society requires a strong sense of community,” Michael J. Sandel writes in his 2009 book about justice, “it must find a way to cultivate into citizens a concern for the whole, a dedication to the common good.”
What has eroded in the 17 years since Sandel’s “Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?” is this concern for the common good. I suspect it has to do with our increasing inability to grasp the important but abstract ideas that have driven American cultural life and domestic policy since the end of World War II. Thinking about justice is hard work.
Just try to imagine justice.
No, seriously. Take a moment, close your eyes, and attempt to imagine what justice looks like. If you’re of a creative bent you might explore whether justice has a sound or a texture. Taste or smell? Sure, why not. But no cheating. You’re not allowed to recall a symbol for justice, such as the famous blindfolded lady with a scale in one hand and a sword in the other.
Can you do it?
Thinking about abstract nouns can give you the equivalent of an ice cream headache. Yet justice is so essential to democracy that it’s something we all should be thinking about right now. The life work of political philosopher John Rawls was linking justice to fairness in a free society, and while we might not have a clear idea about justice, we all know in our gut when something is fair. As a country, we are now engaged in a great struggle over fairness at nearly every level of the public arena.
When I try to imagine justice — and fairness — I get a feeling.
It’s the feeling I get every time I enter a courthouse as a journalist to witness a proceeding. It could be a criminal case where somebody’s on trial for their life, a civil matter where a marriage or a fortune will be decided, or a minor action involving a speeding ticket.
It’s not that I’m naïve enough to believe that courts are perfectly just or that institutions are infallible. No, that feeling of civic reverence that stirs within me is a recognition of the constitutional principles upon which our judicial system is founded, the attempt by imperfect people — judges and lawyers and juries — to aspire to a perfect ideal. I have watched plenty of trials in which justice was more or less served, a few in which it was denied, and just one or two in which I thought the result could not have been more fair. That’s about as close to true justice as we can get in the real world.
Perhaps the most difficult part of believing in a fair and just America is reconciling the aspiration with the reality. People are fallible. Reason and mercy sometimes fail us. Bad laws are passed and oppressive policies enacted. But there is always hope for a correction, as long as there are people willing to speak up and take action.
It took guts for Barr to say what she did.
Courtrooms should not serve as part of the mass deportation machine.
But there’s another reason to keep ICE out of our courtrooms, and that’s the chilling effect that agents might have on the willingness of individuals to report crimes or agree to be witnesses. If you’re an undocumented migrant and you’re being beaten by your partner, wouldn’t you think twice about calling the police if you know deportation awaits at the courthouse door?
Barr, who graduated from the Washburn University School of Law at Topeka and whose grandfather was attorney general of Kansas and on the Kansas Supreme Court, could make a better argument for the sanctity of courtrooms. I suspect she will when the time is right.
Kriegshauser, a Trump nominee who has been U.S. attorney for Kansas since July and confirmed by the Senate on Dec. 19, sent his warning letter to Manhattan’s city manager and commissioners. He said his office is investigating to determine whether Manhattan is a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“Make no mistake, my office will take all necessary steps to enforce federal law as needed,” his letter said.
But equal access to the courts is a fundamental principle. Allowing ICE agents to troll courthouses — even municipal courthouses which hear the most minor of offenses — creates a situation in which access is denied entire classes of people. Yes, courtrooms must remain open to the public. But the agents, unlike journalists and other audience members, were not there as observers. They were there as government actors.
The courtroom is the civil cathedral of American government. It should be a place of reverence and a sanctuary from injustice. Of all of our institutions, it must avoid the taint of political influence to keep the trust of the people, for the power of the courts in a free society comes from the trust of the governed. Our trust has been tested time and again in the past year by high court decisions that appear contrary to the ideal of the common good. We must steel ourselves to frustration and keep the flame of a just America burning in our hearts.
The sanctity of American courtrooms must be preserved as a matter not only of justice, but of fairness. The notion that judges should not “disparage” federal immigration agents for shattering the sanctity of our most sacred civic space is dangerous to a functioning democracy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-11 09:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Summer fruit in January — nature assisted by fossil fuels,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/11/ct-summer-fruit-in-january/,"The next time you’re standing in the produce aisle, marveling at strawberries that taste like July, remember you’re not just buying fruit.","Over the holidays a dear friend sent me a wonderful present.  Not the proverbial “muffin basket” (of which I write so often), but a fresh fruit bonanza from Edible Arrangements that looked like a bouquet of flowers… beautiful and oh, so tasty!



As we devoured the perfectly ripe melon and delicious strawberries, it got me thinking about how lucky we in Connecticut are to be able to enjoy fresh, out-of-season fruit in the depths of winter.  But how it makes its way to our supermarkets is not only a tale of botany but of logistics and long-distance transportation at some cost to our environment: nature assisted by fossil fuels.
Take for example:
Strawberries: Mostly from Mexico, these are trucked but are prone to spoilage, hence the price.  Trade disputes and seasonal customs duties have periodically increased costs, also affecting avocados and berries.  Climate impact:  relatively high.
Oranges: Mostly from California and Florida, this fruit is picked, washed, sanitized, sorted and packed within 24 hours of ripening on the vine.  Stored at 38 – 45 degrees Fahrenheit in refrigerated trucks it begins a four- to six-day drive cross-country.  At food distribution hubs the truckloads are broken into smaller lots for local delivery.  Climate impact:  moderate.
Grapes: Your favorite snacking fruit has come a long way… 5,000+ miles from Chile.  After harvest the grapes are chilled to 32 degrees and packed in “reefers,” refrigerated shipping containers, for the 12 – 14 day ocean voyage to ports like Wilmington DE and Philadelphia for trucking to Connecticut.  Climate impact:  lower due to shipment by sea.
Blueberries: These are grown in Chile and Peru, hand-picked, washed, graded and packaged for refrigerated shipment to the U.S. by boat.  Climate impact:  lower per‑pound impact because sea freight is fuel‑efficient.
Bananas: This is the perfect fruit for long-distance delivery.  In Ecuador, Costa Rica and Colombia bananas grow on massive bunches weighing about 100 pounds.  Harvested while green and fully mature (but not ripe), they are washed, cut and packed into 40-pound boxes which must be stored at exactly 56 – 58 degrees and shipped in reefers with sophisticated monitoring of oxygen and CO2 levels.  After their 8 – 14 day ocean journey to the U.S. East Coast they are trucked to huge ripening facilities where ethylene gas is slowly added.  In about a week they’re ready for local stores.  Climate impact:  relatively low.
Pineapples: Almost all come from Costa Rica and Ecuador, not Hawaii. Picked almost fully-ripe, they are packed and shipped in reefers at a steady 45 – 50 degrees.  From harvesting to our local stores it’s a 10- to 16-day journey.  Climate impact:  moderate.
Melons: Cantaloupe and honeydew are largely imported from Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico in winter, with the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean sources supplying some specialty melons.  Climate impact:  moderate due to long distance reefer trucking.
Local greenhouses:  Not everything we enjoy in the winter is imported. Some Connecticut greenhouse keep turning out leafy greens, some tomatoes, cucumbers and herbs year round.  Climate impact: Minimal transport needs are offset by substantial winter heating requirements, which can give greenhouse crops a higher overall climate impact than their short travel distance might suggest.
So the next time you’re standing in the produce aisle, marveling at strawberries that taste like July, remember you’re not just buying fruit:  you’re looking at the literal ‘fruits’ of a globe-spanning transportation system running on diesel, refrigeration, container ships, human beings and carefully timed logistics.  
It’s a small reminder that our everyday conveniences quietly depend on a vast transportation network, one we rarely think about until those strawberries show up in the dead of winter.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/blueberries-1024x537.jpg,,,2026-01-11 04:57:50.574527

The Jackson Fire Department, the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives  arrested a suspect Saturday night in the latest blaze after the fire department ruled it arson, according to lead investigator Charles Felton. Investigators did not immediately release the name of the suspect or the charges the person could face.
The fire was reported shortly after 3 a.m. at Beth Israel Congregation on Old Canton Road. No congregants were injured.
The library and administrative offices of Jackson’s only synagogue were reduced to charred ruins. Two Torahs were destroyed and five were damaged in the flames that erupted during Shabbat, the weekly Jewish day of rest, according to temple leaders. One Torah that survived the Holocaust was in a glass case and was undamaged in the fire.
Beth Israel has suspended services indefinitely. 
“We have already had outreach from other houses of worship in the Jackson area and greatly appreciate their support in this very difficult time,” the congregation president, Zach Shemper, said in a statement.

Arson is a criminal act of intentionally setting fire to a structure, Felton, the JFD division fire chief, told Mississippi Today. 
Investigators did not immediately know a possible motive, such as whether it was a hate crime. Jewish congregations have been attacked in the U.S. in the past several years, including in Pittsburgh, the San Diego area and Colleyville, Texas.
The state Homeland Security Office is also assisting in the investigation, said Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin Holloway.
Mayor John Horhn said he had spoken with Shemper and hoped for a “swift resolution as to the origin of these actions.”  
“I would hope that all Mississippians and all Jacksonians would commit themselves toward moving beyond such behavior and activity and find a way where we can all get together and get along,” Horhn said.

Felton said firefighters had responded shortly after 3 a.m. in response to a report about a possible “church fire.” After they could not determine the origin of the flames, he said his arson investigators were called to the scene and began to collect video surveillance. He said he received calls Saturday morning from the FBI and the ATF, as a matter of course when a fire occurs at a religious institution. 
On Saturday evening, reporters could smell soot outside the temple and observed a melted camera on the northeast wing of the building and six windows covered in plywood. 
An FBI agent standing next to yellow caution tape began collecting pictures and videos from people in the parking lot. Congregants and synagogue leadership had been at the temple all day, assessing the damage.

Some had gone inside the building, stepping over ash-filled puddles of water to retrieve sacred religious objects from the temple, including Torahs. One of the holiest objects in the Jewish religion, the scrolls typically weigh dozens of pounds and stand a couple feet tall.
The fire also burned the synagogue’s Tree of Life, a plaque that honors and records special occasions for congregants such as bar and bat mitzvahs. 
One congregant, David Edelstein, typically attends Saturday morning services. He did not know the synagogue had been burned when he arrived, but he immediately tried to figure out what had happened.

Initially, congregants believed lightning from thunderstorms the night before had started the fire, so Edelstein said he flew a drone over the top of the synagogue and determined that had not happened. 
The hours moved by fast, he said. As Edelstein, wearing a protective breathing mask, helped measure one of the broken library windows, he looked inside and spotted a book lying face up. He stepped into the library to look closer. 
It was open to the Shema, one of the most important prayers in the Jewish faith that reads “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.” 
“Everything’s charred and stuff but one of the books was on top, opened up right to that,” he said.
Similar to Saturday’s blaze, the 1967 bombing and fire heavily damaged the synagogue’s administrative offices and library but injured no congregants. The rabbi at the time, Perry Nussbaum, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that “bigots” were responsible for the fire, and he believed they might have been inspired by anti-Semitic campaign materials used extensively in that year’s Democratic primary for governor.
Mayor Horhn, 70, said he has some recollection of the 1967 attack, when he was 12.
“I do remember that the Jewish community and the African American community in those days formed alliances and partnerships to fight racism, to fight injustice, to fight mistreatment of citizens for whatever reason,” Horhn said.

Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, kicked off his lieutenant governor campaign Saturday, promising to use the constitutionally weak office to bring people together.
“I am running to try to bring Alabamians with different backgrounds and political identities together, knowing that we will never agree on everything, but we can find common ground on the things that we all want,” Ensler said.
Speaking to more than 100 people at the RSA Activity Center in downtown Montgomery, Ensler pointed out Alabama’s low national rank in education and access to affordable health care. He promised to work to fix those issues instead of creating more, like what he said other politicians do.

“They demonize and marginalize those who are different. They create problems rather than solve them. They skew ignorance and lie in vitriol just to score political points,” Ensler said. “They enjoy having the title, but do not do a damn thing to actually serve the people.”
In his 10-minute speech, Ensler also promised to work to expand Medicaid, eliminate the sales tax on groceries and create a state lottery. The Legislature cut the state grocery tax to 2% in the 2025 legislative session.
“Most people in Alabama want the same things: more money in their pockets to afford the expenses of life,” he said. “They want safe neighborhoods and reduce gun violence. They want quality public schools that prepare our children for the future, and they want access to affordable health care.”
The governor can expand Medicaid by order, but the Legislature would have to approve funding for it. Ensler said that expanding Medicaid and a lottery would bring in revenue for the state to address its education and health care concerns.
“People are having to drive hours now to get to an emergency room. They’re having to drive hard instances to deliver a baby. So really focusing on Alabama implementing Medicaid expansion once and for all,” Ensler said in an interview before the event. “The lottery, that’s something the Senate came one vote short. Using the ability to bring people together, I have a record of doing that at the Legislature.”
The lieutenant governor presides over the Senate and votes if the chamber should deadlock on a proposal. The occupant of the office also becomes governor should the governor leave office before the end of his or her term, but otherwise has very little power. 
Before Ensler got into Alabama politics, he taught history at Robert E. Lee High School in Montgomery. Two of his former students, Udonna Simpson and Josiah King Rodgers, spoke of Ensler’s character.
“I am from Highland Park, which is a lower-income neighborhood here in Montgomery, Alabama, that is often affected by gun violence. However, Rep. Ensler, he was right there. In the Alabama heat, in the Alabama cold, morning, noon, day, night,” Simpson said. “He was right there, advocating, speaking for residents.”
In July, Ensler announced that he would not seek re-election for House District 74 to move back to his home state, New York, to be closer to family.
Rep. Patrice McClammy, D-Montgomery, attended the event in support of Ensler, but she said that even if there was another Democrat running for the position she would still support Ensler.
“I’ve worked with him in the State House, and all the things he’s done, in the Mayor’s office and the community,” McClammy said in an interview after the event. “I told him, ‘You’re not leaving.’”
Since the beginning of his campaign in mid-December, Ensler has raised over $54,000, according to campaign finance records. All of the campaign donations came from individuals, according to the reports. 
Ensler is the first Democrat to join the lieutenant governor race, joining five Republicans, who include current Secretary of State Wes Allen, Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture Rick Pate, businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth, former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and sheriff’s deputy Patrick Bishop. Qualifying for the midterm elections ends on Jan 23. 
Ensler acknowledges the uphill battle of winning a statewide office, despite flipping House District 74 in 2022. 
“I’m not running against someone, I’m running for something,” Ensler said in an interview before the event. “Whoever it is, we’re going to focus on the solutions and be laser focused on that, because that’s what people care about.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_1139-scaled-e1768098281179-1024x612.jpg,,,2026-01-10 21:57:46.409962

Daricka Moore, a 24-year-old man related to at least four of the victims, is in custody charged with first-degree murder. He is being held without bail in the Clay County Jail in West Point.
Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott said at a news conference Saturday that a cadre of state and local law enforcement arrested Moore at a safety checkpoint about a half mile from the second crime scene. The search included local officers and those from Mississippi Highway Patrol, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics.
District Attorney Scott Colom said the charges could be upgraded to multiple counts of capital murder.
“I don’t know what kind of motive there could be to shoot a 7-year-old child,” Colom said.
The rampage began before 7 p.m. at a home on David Hill Road. Moore allegedly fatally shot his father, Glenn Moore, 67; uncle, Willie Guine, 55; and brother Quinten Moore, 33. Scott said each man was shot in the head.
Scott said the suspect stole Quinton Moore’s F150 truck and drove to the second crime scene, where he allegedly broke into the house and tried to sexually assault someone before killing the 7-year-old girl, whom the sheriff said identified as the suspect’s second cousin.
WTVA-TV reported that her family identified her as Mikiylia Guines.
The child’s mother and two other children were in the home. After the girl was killed, Moore allegedly put a gun to the head of another child, believed to be even younger, Scott said.
Scott said Moore then drove to a home on Siloam-Griffith Road, where investigators found the aluminum-colored truck hidden behind the house. That’s where they discovered the bodies of Barry Bradley and Samuel Bradley, who also apparently had been shot in the head. One of them was the pastor of an Apostolic church.

Scott said the family is experiencing overwhelming grief.
“For this family to lose this many family members in one setting is just hard to imagine,” Scott said.
Colom said that when the sheriff briefed him on what happened, “it really shook me. It’s the worst I’ve ever seen. Six people’s lives taken.”
Moore is scheduled for his first court appearance Monday in Clay County while investigators search for answers and the state Crime Lab begins running ballistics tests. 
“This guy has not been on our radar. We don’t know what was going through his mind,” Scott said.
He said gun violence is happening all across the country. This mass shooting comes less than three months after seven people were killed and many others were wounded in multiple shootings in Mississippi following high school and a college homecoming games.
Colom said the death penalty would have to be considered in this case. “If it’s eligible, you have to seek to seek the highest punishment under Mississippi law,” he said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100414/EddieScottDOYLE-26-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-10 20:57:08.875495

The marchers began at Powderhorn Park and passed by the site where Good was killed. The protest was part of over a 1,000 planned demonstrations against ICE across the nation this weekend.
Among the demonstrators was a group of Roosevelt High School students. Hours after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good, Border Patrol agents arrived at the high school and deployed tear gas as students were being dismissed.
“I want to be able to go to work and school without worrying that we are going to be attacked,” said junior Maria Delong, who said she burst into tears watching a video of her favorite teachers being tackled by federal agents.

Fahad Mo, 26, is a Somali-American who grew up in Cedar-Riverside, which has a large Somali community. He’s part of the Cedar-Riverside Protection Alliance, a newly formed group working to protect the Somali community in the neighborhood from immigration officers.
“I want Trump to know Somali-Americans are always going to be here,” Mo said at the protest. “Immigrants are always going to be here.”
The Minnesota Somali community has been the focus of a targeted deportation campaign by the Trump administration since late November, even though the vast majority are citizens or legal residents.
Protests at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which federal immigration agents use as a base, has been more confrontational. Federal agents fired pepper balls at a small group of protesters at the Whipple Building at the same time as the much larger Powderhorn protest, CNN reported.
On Friday night, police arrested 30 people, who have since been released, for blocking streets and damaging property at a protest outside hotels in downtown Minneapolis where ICE agents are thought to be staying, the Star Tribune reported. The police said protesters caused about $6,000 in damage from broken windows and graffiti at the Depot Renaissance Hotel.

“If [ICE] is bold enough to do that on the street, then what are they doing to our neighbors and friends that are detained?” Burchard asked. 
Another protester, a Lincoln resident who didn’t wish to disclose a name for fear of losing a job with the government, said people went to protest to “keep searching for the truth and accountability” from the Trump administration.
“I believe in this country,” the protester said. “I believe we’re going the wrong way.”

President Donald Trump and other federal officials have said the Minnesota agent had acted “in self-defense,” while Minnesota state officials have questioned federal accounts of the shooting as “propaganda” and blamed stepped-up immigration enforcement, expanded hiring and lax training. Minnesota investigators say they have been excluded from the investigation. 
A New York Times analysis of videos from three different angles shows the woman, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, turning her SUV away from the ICE agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, and that he was not in the path of her vehicle when he fired three shots at close range. 
Another video from the cellphone held by the agent who fatally shot Good appears to show him just to the side of the vehicle when he fires, according to footage published by Alpha News, a conservative news outlet. It was not immediately clear whether the SUV made contact with the officer or where the agent was standing when he fired the shots.

Another discussion point for protesters on Saturday was the shooting in Portland involving two people shot by federal agents a day after Good was shot and killed. 
Portland Police said the two people shot were tied to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. The Department of Homeland Security claimed Luis David Nico Moncada, one of the two people shot, “weaponized” the vehicle against officers who shot in self-defense. 
Nebraska saw protests against federal immigration agents last year after an ICE raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha sent people to a North Platte jail. 
U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican serving Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District, said this week that “it’s very important that we get the facts.” 
“We should take a deep breath,” Bacon told reporters. “Let’s investigate and let the judicial system work.”

The event was part of a nationwide wave of protests planned in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday and a Border Patrol shooting in Portland on Thursday.
Organized by Indivisible Grand Junction, the “ICE Out For Good” protest drew hundreds of people to the Old County Courthouse in Grand Junction. It was billed as a silent protest to honor Good and remember others who have died in ICE custody under the Trump administration. Organizers listed the names of more than 30 people who have died while in ICE custody in 2025 and two, including Good, who have died this year.
Protesters demanded accountability for ICE and called for the agency to leave their communities.

Hundreds of people gathered at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday night to protest Good’s killing. Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.
Activists in Colorado Springs held a vigil for Good outside the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday night, an event that the Colorado Springs Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression said was to condemn her killing and “honor her life in her hometown.”



“She went to the same schools that we went to … she lived in the same neighborhoods that we lived in,” said Brandon Rincon, the group’s founder, according to Colorado Springs TV station KRDO. “It just makes us want to fight for her more.”
The Trump administration last year implemented mass deportation efforts, which have prompted a series of protests as aggressive enforcement methods resulted in a spike in arrests, including of people with no criminal record or charges, and questions about due process.
An “ICE Out” protest is planned for 9 a.m., Sunday, at the ICE Denver Field Office in Centennial.

Those are among the outcomes so far of the neighborhood process and design review for a desperately needed affordable housing project in Jamaica Plain. They are emblematic of Boston’s broken land use process, through which neighbors assert parochial interests to stymie needed housing development or impose additional costs and delays. Even when that development advances the city’s purported goals – goals that city leaders appear unwilling to expend political capital to advance.
Founded in 1860, Rogerson Communities provides assisted living, memory care services, and independent living opportunities to older adults in the Commonwealth. In the summer of 2024, Rogerson began meeting with neighbors near its 3.2-acre site on the Jamaicaway and in August it filed a Letter of Intent with the Boston Planning Department, announcing plans to redevelop a surface parking lot and a vacant single-family home.  
The first phase of the initial proposal sought to replace the lot with below-grade parking and construct a new building that would replace existing memory care and day programs, and add 71 units of affordable senior housing. The building would be seven stories tall, exceeding the three-story maximum under the zoning code, but still one story less than the eight-story building next door. As initially presented, the project offered outdoor space for community use, used passive housing construction, and collected and reused rainwater for landscaping.
Although there was some support from neighbors, opposition coalesced early last year around the three-legged stool of NIMBYism — traffic, parking and “neighborhood character” — as well as height and shadows.  
A few insisted they weren’t against affordable housing, just this project. The one near, if not quite in, their backyard. Predictably, the result was a revised and smaller project, reduced first to 67 and then to 41 units of affordable housing. Fewer people housed. Higher per-unit costs. A neighborhood’s physical character preserved at the expense of the additional housing needed to preserve its social fabric. 
The reduction in the number of units at the Rogerson-Beaufort project is not an anomaly. It is the order of business in Boston — where excessive public processes, an outdated and outsized zoning code, and the influence of an unrepresentative set of residents combine to choke the supply of housing at every turn. 
Thirty units may seem inconsequential, but cumulatively such reductions, which happen over and over when development projects are reviewed, exacerbate our desperate housing shortage. The result is a city that talks about solving its housing crisis but whose actions – collectively and individually – ensure the problem persists.
Rogerson Communities’ proposal would seem to check all the boxes that city officials purport to care about. It replaced a surface parking lot with new community space, trees, and much-needed housing. It added a significant number of new parking spaces via a garage. The design was thoughtful, the building attractive, and the traffic impacts minimal. Most importantly, the project promised homes for low-income seniors in a city where older residents face escalating housing costs. 
The neighbors who oppose this and other projects reflect the natural tendency of what Dartmouth economist William Fischel famously termed “homevoters” – the homeowners who dominate local politics and discourage higher density development they perceive as a threat to their property values. This phenomenon can be found not just in smaller suburban communities, but also in urban areas. 
Our zoning system should not pit neighborhoods against one another in a desire to resist new development. In a functioning system, a city would plan and zone in a manner that permits as-of-right future development in response to growth and changes in demand.
A recent study found that 58 percent of parcels in Boston are nonconforming with respect to floor-area ratio. In other words, most buildings that exist would not be legal to build today.
We are not simply failing to zone in a manner that permits needs development. We are zoning in a manner so restrictive that our current city, the one so many are so eager to preserve in amber, would be impossible to build today.
Boston’s development review process, while perhaps intended to advance  thoughtful, democratic decision-making, in practice reflects an ad hoc system of neighborhood vetoes. Those who attend meetings and submit comments are overwhelmingly older and more likely to own homes, consistent with the experience in other communities. Allowing informal neighborhood groups and the unrepresentative collection of individuals with time and flexibility to show up on a Tuesday night to shape or halt projects undermines the rule of law.  
Rather than reflecting some sort of democratic ideal of local control, Boston’s process empowers those who already have housing to block housing for those who do not. 
Maintaining the status quo benefits those who already own property and possess the resources to wield political power. As Mayor Wu herself wrote in her 2019 report Fixing Boston’s Broken Development Process, “A system of special approvals driven by influence disadvantages those without resources.” Yet the mayor has, after one full term, done little to move the city away from this system.  
Modest attempts to upzone neighborhoods have moved slowly. Development still depends upon a system of discretionary relief. So Boston approves more than 1,000 variance applications each year, compared with single- and double-digit numbers in far larger cities. We patch together a city through ad hoc determinations in which local interests dictate the outcome. Efforts to modernize the process focus on maintaining this community review of individual projects. 
Fixing Boston’s land use system requires more than tinkering at the margins. It demands a wholesale rethinking of how the city regulates land and how it decides what gets built and where. Zoning should, as its earliest proponents recognized, allow for development in response to present and future needs. Only then will it serve the general welfare that provides the legal basis for its existence.  
The city must limit the ability of individual residents and neighborhood groups to delay or downsize projects, as a Boston Globe editorial recently recognized. Public participation is valuable at the level of crafting policy and developing zoning; it should not govern case-by-case determinations regarding individual projects. Elected officials responsive to their constituents should set the course of development rather than self-appointed neighborhood representatives.   
Perhaps the plot of land across the street from my home in Jamaica Plain was not the best place in the city for 30 additional units of affordable housing. However, in a system where discretionary review determines what can be built, rather than as-of-right zoning implemented through a citywide process, no one is considering the broader context and adequately weighing the general welfare.  
The housing crisis is not inevitable. It is the direct result of choices—choices made in hearing rooms and zoning meetings, choices to privilege trees over people and process over progress. If Boston wants to live up to its ideals, it must choose differently.

The weekly demonstration organized by the local chapter of Indivisible, the national protest group, usually draws 60-100 people. But the crowd swelled after Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot during a Wednesday raid on the city’s immigrant community.
Portland resident Jen Boggs told those assembled that as an immigrant born in the Philippines, “I am afraid, and I am willing to bet that a lot of you are afraid here, too.”

“We are afraid and that is not fair. None of this is fair. We have laws, they don’t obey them. We have rights, they don’t observe them,” she said, imploring the crowd to be brave. “We are here together.” 
Many protesters held homemade signs denouncing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and President Donald Trump. Following similar deployments to Los Angeles, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon, the Trump administration sent more than 2,000 law enforcement officers to the Twin Cities in recent days. 
Part of that force was ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who Trump said was justified in shooting Good, contradicting video evidence of the encounter. Since the shooting, the administration said it is sending even more federal officers to the city.
ICE agents have also been spotted on the streets of Maine in recent weeks.
“Your ICE thugs can’t stop us. We’ll stand up side by side,” sang Cape Elizabeth resident Becky Bronson, adapting the lyrics of “All you fascists” by Woody Guthrie. “For everyone you’re hurting, for everyone who’s died. We’ll melt you down, get the f**k out of our town.”
Saturday’s rally is the second protest the city has seen since the Minneapolis shooting, echoing demonstrations across the country. On Thursday evening, hundreds gathered in downtown Portland for a vigil. Other rallies were planned elsewhere in Maine Saturday, including South Portland, Yarmouth, Bangor and Saco.
In a statement posted to her Senate campaign Facebook page Wednesday evening, Gov. Janet Mills called the shooting a “horrific tragedy” and said Trump “has weaponized ICE into an unaccountable, masked armed force deployed at his will to target those he opposes.”
“Maine cannot and will not turn a blind eye to ICE’s unacceptable actions,” she added, pointing to her recent announcement that she would allow legislation restricting local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement to become law. 
Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said that the “level of brutality that we are seeing displayed by ICE is unprecedented.”
“I think when we see violations of law like this one, the extent of danger is really impalpable,” Curren Rowles said, adding that the demonstrations show that there’s “many people who realize, this is the time to speak up, and act up and get involved.”

Good was killed while acting as a legal observer, which Curren Rowles explained is a show “of solidarity for people who may not be personally affected to go and provide support and watch what’s happening and observe.”
Portland resident Kim Wells said, for her, Good represents “Americans who don’t necessarily have to come out and speak, protesting.” 
Wells, who stood on the roadside holding a homemade sign featuring a picture of Good, also pointed out that she isn’t the first person who has been killed by ICE. “Immigrants have been getting murdered for the last year, but it takes a middle class white woman for people to start uniting,” she said.
Asked how Mainers can keep themselves safe, Curren Rowles pointed to the ACLU’s many resources and said, “Knowing your rights is critically important.”
“We need to understand our rights in order to exercise them and also in order to make sure they don’t go away and advocate for them,” she said. “And this is the time to really do that.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/anti-ice-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 16:57:29.188735
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-10 21:01:29+00:00,CT Mirror,CT residents join ‘ICE Out for Good’ protests after fatal shooting of Renee Good,Reginald David and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/10/ice-out-for-good-protests-ct-fairfield-fatal-shooting-renee-good/,Hundreds of people turned out to protest around CT on Saturday for the ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action.,"More than 100 people gathered outside the Home Depot on Grasmere Avenue in Fairfield late Saturday morning, filling the sidewalk with handmade signs, chants and the steady sound of car horns from drivers slowing down to show support.
For months, the big box store’s parking lot has been a familiar meeting spot. Since mid-October, a small but committed group of protesters has returned nearly every Saturday, standing near the main entrance with a large banner that reads, “Neighbors, Not ICE.”
“The first day it was just four of us, because that’s how many people it takes to hold the sign,” said Callie Heilmann, a co-director of Bridgeport Generation Now who has helped organize the protests since they began last fall.
That changed this week.
Following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Heilmann said organizers put out a call on the organizing platform Mobilize, asking people to show up for an emergency protest as part of a nationwide “ICE Out For Good” Weekend of Action.
By Saturday morning, more than 100 people had signed up, roughly 10 times the typical turnout.
“This came together in 24 hours,” Heilmann said.

The protest began around 11 a.m., with demonstrators lining the sidewalk along Grasmere Avenue, holding signs that read “ICE Out for Good,” “Abolish ICE,” and “No Human Is Illegal.” As chants echoed across the parking lot, cars driving past honked repeatedly, some drivers raising fists or waving through open windows.
Organizers said the protest was part of a broader, grassroots response to what they describe as a pattern of unchecked violence and lack of accountability by federal immigration enforcement agencies.
On Wednesday, Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, was killed during an encounter involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Minneapolis. The shooting has sparked outrage across the country, with critics accusing the federal government of immediately defending the officers involved and failing to provide transparency or accountability.
Although there was a large turnout at the Fairfield event, the protest remained peaceful. The events were in contrast to a vigil two days earlier in Hartford in which a group of people confronted vehicles exiting a federal building on the other side of where a peaceful vigil was being held in reaction to Good’s death. 
The incident ended with one person being struck by a vehicle and at least half a dozen being pepper sprayed. Hartford officials said Friday they had a “strong suspicion” the people driving the vehicles involved in the encounter were federal employees.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam also said Friday that the events are being investigated by the local police and the Department of Homeland Security. He said the violence that occurred on Thursday night “is a direct result of the lawlessness and recklessness of the Trump administration that has occurred over the past year and that last night came here to the city of Hartford, that resulted earlier this week in the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis. That chaos that we saw last night didn’t come from the city of Hartford.”
Among those who answered the call to protest Saturday in Fairfield were Hillie McTernan, 38, and her friend Lisa Endo, 44, both of Fairfield.
McTernan said she and Endo have attended nearly a dozen “No Kings” events and other demonstrations opposing the Trump administration over the past year. Still, she said the response to the fatal shooting of Good felt different, and deeply alarming.
“It feels like it could happen to anyone now,” McTernan said. “The government response was just complete defense of the officers. That’s horrifying.”

Nearby, Karen Butler, an 81-year-old Norwalk resident, stood holding a sign that read “ICE Out for Good,” decorated with an illustration of a woman created by a Chicago-based artist. Butler described herself as a veteran of recent protests but said the moment felt darker than others she had experienced.
“My earlier signs were too kind,” Butler said. “I’m defending democracy. I never thought it would end up like this.”
Saturday’s rally was one of hundreds planned nationwide as part of the ICE Out for Good Weekend of Action. Organizers said protests were scheduled in cities and towns across the country, including roughly a dozen locations in Connecticut such as Brookfield, Torrington and New London.
For many who attended the Fairfield protest, Good’s death raised fears not just about immigration enforcement, but about public safety and the rule of law more broadly.
Sonya Huber, 54, of Stratford, said the incident sent a chilling message to communities already feeling vulnerable.
“I don’t know who among us is safe,” Huber said. “If we’re coming to a protest, I think it represents a complete disregard for the rule of law and the safety of residents and citizens.”
She added that the shooting has had a ripple effect far beyond Minnesota.
“It’s a major alarm bell among thousands,” Huber said. “It strikes fear in those who are willing to stand up for the most vulnerable.”
Mike Martinez, 26, a Shelton resident, said he came to the protest out of frustration and anger, describing the fatal shooting as part of a broader erosion of democratic norms.
“The slaughter of American citizens under this administration is just beyond incomprehensible,” Martinez said. “How we let this happen after Jan. 6, five years ago, is an indictment on us as a nation, and especially the 50% who voted.”
When asked what message he hoped the protest would send, Martinez said unity was central.
“That we’re going to stand united,” he said. “This is inhumane, and we’re not going to allow it. We’re not going to allow fascists to rule this country.”
He added that the size of the crowd was itself a statement.
“The half of the country that opposes this administration is louder than the half that supports it,” Martinez said.

Bridgeport resident Litzy Leon, 25, said she felt compelled to attend after learning more details about Good’s death.
“I just feel like it’s absurd that we’re allowing a murderer free only because he holds the title of ICE agent,” Leon said. “She wasn’t even doing anything wrong, she was just driving away. There was no attack on the agent.”
Leon said the incident also raised concerns about gun use and accountability within federal agencies.
“The gun control is just crazy,” she said.
When asked what kind of accountability protesters are calling for, Leon said the demands are basic, but urgent.
“At the very minimum, we need to see a trial,” she said. “An investigation needs to be held. A trial needs to happen. All respect towards Renee.”
Throughout the protest, speakers rotated through a megaphone, leading chants and urging passersby to learn more about immigration enforcement practices and how to support impacted communities. Organizers emphasized that the Fairfield demonstration was not just about one incident, but about sustained pressure.
Heilmann said the weekly protests will continue.
“This isn’t going away,” she said. “People are scared, they’re angry, and they’re paying attention. And they’re showing up.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0224-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-10 16:12:40.524275

(Elaine Cromie / Chalkbeat)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Mayor Mary Sheffield made Pershing High School the first stop after her public swearing-in ceremony on Friday.
The stop at the Detroit Public Schools Community District’s neighborhood school reflected her campaign promise to focus her term on initiatives that will improve the lives of young people.
Lines of cheerleaders and a hallway booming with applause greeted Sheffield. As students and adults clamored to point their cellphone cameras at the mayor when she walked in, girls talked to each other about how excited they were to meet the city’s first female mayor.
“I’m very grateful to be in the presence of such a person,” said senior Neveah Washington.
Sheffield, who was sworn in during a private ceremony on Jan. 1, spent 30 minutes with nearly 90 students in the school’s library. She talked about partnering with the city’s schools to address systemic issues that affect the quality of students’ education, from improving city transportation to offering more after-school programming and wraparound services.
The mayor said she also wants to give youth reasons to stay in Detroit, such as more career opportunities and affordable housing.
Though the mayor does not have control over schools, Sheffield told the students, “that does not mean that the mayor cannot be a great partner, that we cannot be visible and hands-on with our youth – and that is what I intend to do.”
Education became a key issue in the mayor’s race as more advocates pushed for the office to address underlying systemic challenges that contribute to poor academic performance and chronic absenteeism in the city’s schools.
Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the students that Sheffield’s presence at the school reflects her interest in investing in opportunities that will benefit neighborhood schools.
“Being here at Pershing, being here at DPSCD, in a traditional public school, and a neighborhood school on the east side, all of that is intentional,” he said. “If we don’t have strong neighborhood schools, you can’t have a strong city.”
Sheffield told the students she is creating the city’s first youth department. Jerjuan Howard, the city’s new director of youth affairs, said each department in the mayor’s office will make a “youth priority statement” to detail how decisions may affect young people.
“What that means is that you all will be at the center of decision making for anything the city is talking about moving forward,” he said. “No other city in the nation has done this yet.”
Sheffield talked to the students one-on-one and collected their written questions.
DeAngelo Allen, a junior who takes a city bus to school every day, asked Sheffield how she will improve the city’s transportation. Allen said he is often late to school because the buses he relies on either come far earlier or later than their scheduled times.
The teen said he feels like he has to be vigilant about safety when he rides the bus.
“You have to watch your surroundings,” he said. “You see some pretty disturbing stuff.”
Mac Sconi, 17, asked Sheffield how she will address safety concerns – an issue many students say affects their ability to learn and get to school.
The teen said he was optimistic about the response he got from the mayor after she expressed she would take a holistic approach to improving safety with crime prevention programs. The city’s new neighborhood and community safety office will promote long-term solutions like mental health and conflict resolution programs, Sheffield added.
“There’s a lot of things right now that are threatening the safety of our students,” Sconi said. “It’s something that needs to be addressed, because what is the importance of anything if we are not safe?”

(Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA)Republican Greg Ford maintained a 21-vote lead in an automatic recount Friday to win a special election for a state House seat in Dorchester County.
The retired Air force veteran fills the last vacancy in the Legislature just ahead of Tuesday’s start to the 2026 session.
The numbers didn’t change with the recount, which state law requires if less than 1 percentage point separates the candidates.
Ford won 50.2% of 3,440 votes in the Tuesday special election, while Democrat Sonja Ogletree Satani won 49.6%. Five voters wrote in someone else’s name. Just over 14% of the district’s registered voters cast a ballot, according to results certified by the state Election Commission.
The special election fills the remainder of former Rep. Chris Murphy’s term.
Both Ford and Ogletree Satani told the SC Daily Gazette they intend to run again for the next full term. So, there could be a rematch in November, depending on the outcome of the June primaries.
Murphy, a former House Judiciary chairman, submitted his resignation in August, though it didn’t go into effect until Monday. He was first elected in 2010 and replaced longtime Republican Rep. Annette Young, who retired after 20 years in the House.
Ogletree Satani previously ran against Murphy in 2024. That race wasn’t nearly as close: Murphy won re-election by 14 percentage points.
Ford and Ogletree Satani each faced two opponents in their primaries. The Republican primary went to a runoff, which Ford won with 56% of the vote.
The Dorchester County race was the last of four special elections for Statehouse seats since the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Three special elections were held two days before Christmas. Republicans won all of them, though that was essentially a given for two of them.
In the only race with a Democrat on the ballot, Lexington County pastor John Lastinger won with 62% of the vote to replace ex-Rep. RJ May, who is set to be sentenced next week after pleading guilty to distributing videos of children being sexually abused. About 11% of that district’s registered voters cast ballots in that Dec. 23 special election, according to the state Election Commission.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/statehouse-roof-and-flags-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 10:58:12.719364

(Peru Ministry of Environment)This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
Daniele Visioni sometimes worries he may be labelled an enemy of the state.
Visioni, a climate scientist and assistant professor at Cornell University, is an Italian-born scholar who will serve as an author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s upcoming Seventh Assessment Report, a document outlining the latest science on climate change, to be published by an international body the Trump administration has now announced the U.S. government will abandon.





Daniele Visioni is a climate scientist and assistant professor at Cornell University. (Cornell University)
“If the U.S. decides that any IPCC author is an enemy of the state, that probably means they can keep me out of the country,” said Visioni, who has had difficult conversations about the possibility with his husband and colleagues. “But when I agreed to be an author in this cycle, I was aware of this risk.”
Visioni is among the many climate scientists who say that the Trump administration’s plan to leave the IPCC and withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is damaging to the scientific community and to the United States’ reputation on the world stage.
Leading climate scientists, many of whom have co-authored IPCC reports, told Inside Climate News that though they believe the administration’s move is troubling, U.S. scientists are committed to advancing climate research, including by fully participating in future IPCC proceedings.


Michael Oppenheimer, a longtime participant in the IPCC, served as a review editor for the body’s Sixth Assessment Report. He was among a group of IPCC scientists awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.


He said the government’s withdrawal from the IPCC should be seen within the broader context of attacks on science pursued by the Trump administration.
“It’s part of the pattern of trying to destroy climate science,” Oppenheimer said.
But the U.S. withdrawal doesn’t serve either American or global interests, he said.

“This kind of action is part of a very large threat to U.S. climate science,” Oppenheimer said. “And that’s not good, not just from the selfish U.S. perspective. This is part of taking the U.S. out of the game—out of the process—and that’s not good for the U.S. and it’s not good for the world.”


Pamela McElwee of Rutgers University said that climate scientists have been working behind the scenes in anticipation of a move like this to ensure that the science—and the contributions of U.S. scientists to an international dialogue on climate change—will continue.





“I was disappointed by the announcement, but not surprised,” said McElwee, who served as co-chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ Nexus assessment from 2021-2024. “We knew the handwriting was on the wall.”
She said that the U.S. is putting itself and its interests at a disadvantage by abandoning the international agreements.
“It’s shooting ourselves in the foot that we’re not going to be able to influence the policy implications,” she said. “So this idea that the U.S. is somehow better off not even being part of the international community on this is clearly just not true on the face of it.”


Libby Jewett, like Visioni, is set to be an author on the IPCC’s next assessment.
Jewett, a marine ecologist who founded the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s ocean acidification program before retiring in early 2025, said the decision to leave the panel undermines the role of the U.S. as well as its impact on climate science.
“We have traditionally been a global powerhouse on climate science, and we have a lot to contribute,” Jewett said. “And the U.S. pulling out just means we’ll have less of a say in how these processes move forward.”


Pamela McElwee is a professor in the Department of Human Ecology at Rutgers University. (Rutgers University)
Visioni said, however, that a lack of U.S. involvement in producing the IPCC’s recommendations for policymakers may be somewhat of a silver lining.
“By withdrawing from all these agreements, the U.S. is not stopping them. It is not stopping U.S. scientists from participating in them,” he said. “The only thing that this government is doing is depriving themselves of the opportunity to influence these reports in any way.”
Pulling out of the IPCC, he said, would prevent the Trump administration from potentially advancing fossil fuel interests in the IPCC assessment’s recommendations to policymakers, which are negotiated between countries.


Oppenheimer said he has a more optimistic view of the IPCC process, which he feels is accustomed to dealing with fossil-fueled actors.
“I think the IPCC process is a good one,” he said. “That’s one reason it’s a damn shame that the U.S. government has decided to withdraw.”
John Christy, Alabama’s state climatologist and a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, said in a written statement to Inside Climate News that there’s “not much to say” about the administration’s decision. The Trump White House has often turned to Christy, who has questioned mainstream climate science, denying the widely-accepted link between carbon emissions and rising global temperatures.
“The IPCC at times produced some reasonable documents, but it was clearly a U.N. bureaucratic organization designed for a policy outcome—the elimination of hydrocarbons,” Christy’s statement said. “I believe this having been a lead author and witnessing the overwhelming bias of those selected as authors.”
Countries continue to turn to fossil fuels, he said, because they “work tremendously well and are affordable.” Countries like England and Germany and states like California and New York that have emphasized growth in renewable energy are “regressing,” he said, and need to “figure this out before they find themselves in the Dark Ages (again).”
Renewable energy now represents the lion’s share of new electricity sources worldwide as costs drop. That raises economic risks for a country doubling down on fossil fuels.

The denigration of science and scientists worries Anna Harper, a University of Georgia climate scientist and IPCC author. Cuts to agencies like NOAA and attacks on global bodies like the IPCC undermine the public’s trust in science and the global community’s trust in the U.S, she said.
“It’s discouraging to see institutions that we’ve all relied on for sound science—institutions that scientists believe are helping Americans—be dismantled,” she said.
The attacks come at a cost. Like Visioni, Harper worries it’s becoming harder to do the work of climate science.
“The same wording has crossed my mind,” she said of Visioni’s comments. “Are we enemies of the state now?”
Despite the political environment, scientists like Rutgers’ McElwee said it’s important that the academic community work together to ensure that policymakers receive the latest, most thorough scholarship on globally important issues like climate change. Individual scientists, universities and other organizations must aim to fill the gaps left by the United States’ withered commitments, she said.
So far, they’re stepping up.
In the context of the IPCC, for example, the U.S. Academic Alliance for the IPCC and the American Geophysical Union have worked together to guarantee the continued participation of U.S. scientists in the panel’s proceedings.
“Our work will continue,” McElwee said. “It has to.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Panel-on-Climate-Change-Peru-Oct-27-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 08:12:15.642115

Some of the bills that have already been filed show that in addition to deciding the fate of property taxes, lawmakers will also be revisiting some old topics.
Listening to the sound of silencers
One of those familiar topics will be an attempt to find a new way to embrace the Second Amendment. A pre-filed bill from Sen. Casey Crabtree, a Madison Republican, would ensure that federal regulations on silencers wouldn’t be enforced in South Dakota.

Senate Bill 2 seeks to take silencers off the “controlled weapons” list where it currently exists with the likes of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns. Despite the Second Amendment’s popularity in South Dakota and the Legislature, this may be an uphill fight for Crabtree, because the portrayal of silencers in popular culture isn’t good. We usually see someone in the movies or on TV using a silencer when they’re committing a crime.
It may also be tough for Crabtree to explain why law-abiding citizens need to silence their weapons. Maybe, if you’re trying to pick off wildlife or stray cats and dogs in your backyard, you don’t want to alert authorities with gunshots. If you’re using a weapon to defend your home, maybe you don’t want to wake the neighbors when shots are fired.
Another attempt to add more limits to term limits
Since 1992, when voters in this state decided it was a good idea to limit the terms of legislators, there have been various attempts to limit them even more. Currently a lawmaker can serve no more than four terms or eight consecutive years in one chamber. Candidates got around that restriction by, after four terms, running for office in the other chamber.
Senate Joint Resolution 501 seeks to change that with a vote of the people. SJR 501, sponsored by Aberdeen Republican Michael Rohl, seeks a state constitutional amendment that would limit lawmakers to eight consecutive years in one chamber, then make them sit out two years before they could make a run at a seat in the other chamber, where they could only serve four consecutive terms.
Since 1992 when legislative terms were limited, lawmakers have been flipping and flopping from one chamber to the other every eight years. If approved by voters, Rhol’s resolution would make sure that veteran lawmakers would have to sit on the bench for two years before they could seek a seat in the other chamber. Two years on the sidelines may not appeal to his colleagues. What term limit backers often forget is that voters have the ultimate say on who serves them. No matter what the law says about consecutive terms, voters control term limits.
Yet another attempt to call for a constitutional convention
Rohl is also the sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 502, which calls for a national constitutional convention. The subject of the convention would be enshrining in the U.S. Constitution a limit on the number of Supreme Court justices.
The current court membership of nine is set by Congress, and Rohl wants to keep it that way. Rohl must be afraid that if Democrats were to somehow gain control of both houses of Congress and the White House, they could change the number to something that benefited them, upping the number of justices on the court who would then be appointed by a Democratic president and would be more likely to favor left-leaning issues.
Just about every year there are resolutions like Rohl’s, though his has the advantage of calling for a unique change in the Constitution. Usually the resolutions are of a more generic nature, calling for a convention that would deal with fiscal restraints or limits to federal power or congressional term limits, or all three.
The bad news for Rohl is that those attempts to call for a constitutional convention rarely succeed in this Legislature. In the past five sessions, the vast majority of resolutions calling for a constitutional convention have been killed in committee or failed in one chamber or the other. With a record of one win and 10 losses in the past five sessions, it’s obvious that a majority of lawmakers recognize those resolutions as a waste of time.

He hasn’t gotten all of them yet, but allies at the state level have ensured that his agenda will progress anyway.
Election reform is a fixation for the president. He regularly posts on social media about elections, from conspiracies about Venezuela’s role in the 2020 election to allegations of voter fraud in California, where he says an investigation has begun. Trump habitually claims the 2020 election was stolen from him.
“Our elections are crooked as hell,” Trump told House Republicans earlier this week.

Many of the election reforms on the Republican Party’s wishlist — like nationwide proof-of-citizenship requirements and paper ballots — have yet to come to fruition. The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which Trump on Monday encouraged members of Congress to pass, has no path forward in the Senate. In 2025, Trump signed an executive order making changes to the federal elections process. The most significant changes it attempted to make have been blocked by the courts.
For example, the League of Women Voters sued the Trump administration over part of that executive order which sought to require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Due to the lawsuit, the directive never went into effect.
But for every win opponents of these measures secure, Trump’s election agenda is still being implemented in other ways at the state level, through either the courts or legislatures, Caren Short, the director of legal and research for the League of Women Voters, told NOTUS. Short described it as intentionally “overwhelming.”
“There aren’t enough attorneys to challenge every single restrictive law in every single state. There’s so many of them,” she said. “And so, some of these are going into place.”
In a statement to NOTUS, the White House acknowledged that sweeping nationwide reform has been difficult. “This process takes time, especially given strong opposition from blue states, with notoriously bad voter roll maintenance,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
But both the White House and the Republican National Committee pointed to successes at the state level.
At the RNC, efforts have been ongoing for years. The committee has challenged election laws in New York and other states, and backed states in their fights to maintain Republican-aligned voting laws.
The RNC joined the Mississippi Republican Party in suing the state over its absentee ballot receipt deadline, arguing that only ballots received by Election Day should be counted. It has led to a pending Supreme Court hearing, with a decision expected as early as this summer. If the RNC is successful, absentee ballots will have to be received on or before Election Day, a deviation from rules in as many as 30 states and the District of Columbia.
It’s one of 115 election-related lawsuits the RNC said it filed last year.
“While Democrats block commonsense reforms, Republicans are strengthening voter ID, enforcing citizenship requirements, protecting mail-in ballot safeguards, and cleaning voter rolls to ensure secure, fair midterm elections,” RNC spokesperson Kiersten Pels said in a statement.
The Trump administration has used the Department of Justice to compel blue states to cooperate with efforts to purge voter rolls. Dozens of states have been hit with lawsuits over confidential voter information, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive law and public policy institute.
States willing to work with the Trump administration have used U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services’ SAVE database to verify that voters are citizens. In Texas, 2,700 registered voters were flagged as “potential noncitizens” and removed. A 2024 ProPublica investigation found that Gov. Greg Abbott’s claims about noncitizens on Texas voter rolls appeared inflated and, in some cases, wrong.
Jason Snead, the executive director of the Honest Elections Project, a conservative nonprofit that has worked with state legislatures on election reform, says the Trump administration has improved the accessibility of federal records for states that want to cross-reference them with their voter rolls.
“That’s one of the areas where the Trump administration has really done incredible work, making that a tool that states can and are using to identify noncitizens on the rolls, and I give them a lot of credit for making that an early priority of the Trump administration,” he told NOTUS.
The progress made by Republicans and the Trump administration means that elections, especially in red states where change has been more swift, will look different this year. In addition to potential legal changes due to Supreme Court rulings and changes to how mail is postmarked, state legislatures have passed reforms too.
And even without the SAVE Act, some state legislatures have passed laws this year requiring voters to present proof of citizenship.
While Republicans say elections are more secure for it, voter-access advocates worry Trump and Republicans are fast-tracking efforts to make elections even more difficult to access for people who have been historically disenfranchised.
“Our legislators and our leaders should be thinking about how they can make voting more accessible, expanding to more voters, and instead, they’re focused on: How do we restrict the electorate even more than it is now? How do we add burdens?” Short said. “I would argue that they are achieving a lot of what they are setting out to do.”

Sam Brownback cut income taxes with promises of economic growth. Instead, the state faced years of budget shortfalls, education cuts, and credit downgrades. Just five years later, the Republican-controlled legislature voted to override Brownback’s veto and restore the income tax. 
Missouri is now debating a similar tax path at the same moment a major source of federal health care assistance is being withdrawn.
Enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies have expired for approximately 417,000 Missourians after Congress adjourned without extending them. Those subsidies have been a key reason marketplace coverage remained affordable for middle-income families over the past several years.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies would more than double what subsidized enrollees pay for coverage on average. Annual premium payments are projected to rise from $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026 — an increase of $1,016, or 114%. 
For many middle-income households, that increase alone exceeds the annual income tax savings being promised under Missouri’s tax proposals. 
According to December estimates, state revenue is running roughly $400 million below projections, largely due to the capital gains tax exemption enacted earlier this year which is now estimated to cost around $500 million annually — far more than originally forecast.
Gov. Mike Kehoe has made eliminating Missouri’s income tax his top priority for 2026, arguing that lower taxes will put more money in Missourians’ pockets and attract businesses. But for households losing ACA subsidies, health care costs are projected to rise by more than $1,000 a year at the same time tax savings are measured in the hundreds.
Analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows that about two-thirds of the capital gains tax exemption benefits flow to the top 1% of earners. The average millionaire saves roughly $43,000 a year. Working families save about $80. Those least affected by rising healthcare costs receive the largest tax benefits, while families facing four-figure premium increases see little relief.
Kansas’s experience offers a cautionary example of how aggressive tax cuts can erode state revenue and shift costs onto public services relied on by families and employers alike.
State leaders are now proposing to eliminate the income tax entirely — a revenue source that generates about $8.7 billion annually and accounts for roughly two-thirds of Missouri’s general revenue. That money supports core services, including public schools, Medicaid, mental health care and child protection.
Kehoe and House Speaker Jon Patterson say their approach will avoid Kansas’s mistakes through gradual phase-ins and fiscal guardrails. The full proposal is expected to be revealed during the governor’s State of the State address next week.
For several years, Missouri has had historically large reserves. The surplus peaked at nearly $8 billion in June 2023. Large sums have been set aside for improvements to Interstates 70 and 44, a major expansion of the Capitol Building, and construction projects on college campuses and elsewhere. But one-time reserves cannot offset ongoing annual losses from permanent tax cuts or recurring health care cost increases.
Missourians need clear answers to basic questions: Which state and local services would be reduced or eliminated, and by how much? What revenue sources would replace $8.7 billion in annual income tax revenue? And what assumptions about economic growth and revenue replacement underpin the proposed phase-ins?
Without answers to these questions, it’s impossible to distinguish responsible restructuring from a high-stakes experiment undertaken amid existing fiscal pressure.
States without income taxes typically rely on oil and gas royalties or significantly higher sales and property taxes — revenue sources Missouri lacks.
According to Becker’s Hospital Review’s December 2025 analysis of Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform data, 29 of Missouri’s rural hospitals are already at risk of closure, including 12 at immediate risk within the next two or three years.
Marketplace coverage has become a major source of insurance across much of the state. Analysis from Washington University shows that in most Missouri counties, growth in ACA marketplace enrollment outpaced Medicaid enrollment during the expansion period.
As subsidies expire, more Missourians are likely to delay or forgo coverage, increasing uncompensated care hospitals are legally required to provide. Reductions in state revenue place additional pressure on Medicaid funding that rural hospitals depend on, threatening to accelerate closures and leave some communities without local emergency or maternity care.
Each dollar Missouri spends on traditional Medicaid draws roughly $1.80 in federal matching funds. For Medicaid expansion enrollees, the federal government covers about 90% of costs, leaving the state responsible for roughly 10%.
In December, U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley broke with his party to support extending the enhanced subsidies, citing families fearful of losing affordable coverage. Missouri’s state leadership, meanwhile, remains focused on advancing income tax elimination.
For many Missouri families losing ACA subsidies in 2026, projected healthcare cost increases exceed the tax savings being proposed — at the same time Missouri’s general revenue is already running below projections, limiting the state’s ability to absorb additional health care and coverage costs.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/money-e1750989760274-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-10 07:12:15.826939

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minneapolis is once again the focus of debates about violence involving law enforcement after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother, in her car.
The incident quickly prompted dueling narratives. Trump administration officials defended the shooting as justified, while local officials condemned it.
The shooting will also likely prompt renewed scrutiny of training and policy of officers and the question of them shooting at moving vehicles. There has been a recent trend in law enforcement toward policies that prohibit such shootings. It is a policy shift that has shown promise in saving lives.
Decades ago, the New York City Police Department prohibited its officers from shooting at moving vehicles. That led to a drop in police killings without putting officers in greater danger.
Debates over deadly force are often contentious, but as I note in my research on police ethics and policy, for the most part there is consensus on one point: Policing should reflect a commitment to valuing human life and prioritizing its protection. Many use-of-force policies adopted by police departments endorse that principle.
Yet, as in Minneapolis, controversial law enforcement killings continue to occur. Not all agencies have implemented prohibitions on shooting at vehicles. Even in agencies that have, some policies are weak or ambiguous.
In addition, explicit prohibitions on shooting at vehicles are largely absent from the law, which means that officers responsible for fatal shootings of drivers that appear to violate departmental policies often escape criminal penalties.
In the case of ICE, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, its policy on shooting at moving vehicles — unlike that of many police agencies — lacks a clear instruction for officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. It’s an omission at odds with generally recognized best practices in policing.
 
ICE’s policy on shooting at moving vehicles
ICE’s current use-of-force policy prohibits its officers from “discharging firearms at the operator of a moving vehicle” unless it is necessary to stop a grave threat. The policy is explicit that deadly force should not be used “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect.”
That point is relevant for evaluating the fatal shooting in Minneapolis. Videos show one officer trying to open the door of the vehicle that Good was driving, while another officer appears to be in front of the vehicle as she tried to pull away.
Shooting to prevent the driver simply from getting away would have been in violation of agency policy and obviously inconsistent with prioritizing the protection of life.
ICE’s policy lacks clear instruction, however, for its officers to get out of the way of moving vehicles where feasible. In contrast, the Department of Justice’s use-of-force policy makes it explicit that officers should not shoot at a vehicle if they can protect themselves by “moving out of the path of the vehicle.”
Notably, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2022 requiring federal law enforcement agencies — like ICE — to adopt use-of-force policies “that are equivalent to, or exceed, the requirements” of the Department of Justice’s policy.
Despite that order, the provision to step out of the way of moving cars never made it into the use-of-force policy that applies to ICE.
 
The rationale for not shooting at moving vehicles
Prioritizing the protection of life doesn’t rule out deadly force. Sometimes such force is necessary to protect lives from a grave threat, such as an active shooter. But it does rule out using deadly force when less harmful tactics can stop a threat. In such cases, deadly force is unnecessary — a key consideration in law and ethics that can render force unjustified.
That’s the concern involved with police shooting at moving vehicles. It often is not necessary because officers have a less harmful option to avoid a moving vehicle’s threat: stepping out of the way.
This guidance has the safety of both suspects and police in mind. Obviously, police not shooting lowers the risk of harm to the suspect. But it also lowers the risk to the officer in the vast majority of cases because of the laws of physics. If you shoot the driver of a car barreling toward you, that rarely brings a car to an immediate stop, and the vehicle often continues on its path.
Many police departments have incorporated these insights into their policies. A recent analysis of police department policies in the 100 largest U.S. cities found that close to three-quarters of them have prohibitions against shooting at moving vehicles.
 
The gap between policy and best practices for protecting life
The shooting in Minneapolis serves as a stark reminder of the stubborn gap that persists between law and policy on the one hand and best law enforcement practices for protecting life on the other. When steps are taken to close that gap, however, they can have a meaningful impact.

Some of the most compelling examples involve local, state and federal measures that reinforce one another. Consider the “fleeing felon rule,” which used to allow police to shoot a fleeing felony suspect to prevent their escape even when the suspect posed no danger to others.
That rule was at odds with the doctrine of prioritizing the protection of life, leading some departments to revise their use-of-force policies and some states to ban the rule. In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for police to shoot a fleeing suspect who was not a danger.
Banning that questionable tactic notably led to a reduction in killings by police.
This history suggests that clear bans in law and policy on questionable tactics have the potential to save lives, while also strengthening the means for holding officers accountable.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland overpaid $807.4 million in unemployment benefits since the COVID-19 pandemic and missed the opportunity to recover $760 million of that amount because it took to long do to so, state auditors said.
The report published Friday by the Office of Legislative Audits covered unemployment benefit paid out between Nov. 16, 2020, and Jan. 15, 2025, when states were flush with federal cash to help them through the pandemic and the sudden and historic loss of jobs that came with it. The chance to collect many of those overpayments passed in May 2025, the auditors said.
“That is quite concerning to me when we are not good stewards of taxpayer money,” said Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), co-chair of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “We have a (budget) shortfall, and we need to make sure that our money is spent on the priorities and the values we adhere to.”
Labor Secretary Portia Wu said her department takes the findings of the audit “very seriously” and that it is working to recover as much as it can going forward. But she also noted that “about 90%” of the unrecoverable overpayments would have fallen under the administration of Gov. Larry Hogan (R), and that much of the money involved would not have been state funds, but federal money that states received during the pandemic.
“We had been working on addressing these underlying problems far before these audit findings,” Wu said Friday, noting that the department has recovered “over $500 million in fraudulent, overpaid claims in 2025” and is “pursuing another $1.3 billion in overpayments.”
Labor secretary raises concerns about solvency of state unemployment fund

The Labor Department’s Division of Unemployment Insurance collects unemployment insurance taxes from employers and distributes unemployment benefits. The department explains on its website that “overpayments can occur for several reasons, including unreported wages, changes in work availability, or identity theft or fraud committed by a third party, which was particularly an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
During the pandemic, the federal government offered states additional money to help keep up with surging unemployment claims at the time.
“We all know that the unemployment system had enormous, enormous strains during COVID and it just wasn’t functional in the way it needed to be during that crisis,” Hettleman said. “And then there were lots of starts and stops to get it up and running, and then there were legal issues and lots of concerns about fraud.”
State auditors found that the unemployment division “did not timely pursue recovery of claimant overpayments totaling $807.4 million resulting in up to $760.7 million that is no longer collectable as of May 2025.”
The labor department argues that the unrecoverable overpayments are closer to $600 million. Wu also noted that part of the collection of those overpayments were stalled in January 2022 by a legal challenge, which did not lift until September 2023.
But the audit notes that the department did not have “sufficient” overpayment collection even after the suspension ended, “resulting in an additional $33.6 million in overpayments not being adequately pursued.”
In response, the department said there was “necessary back-end work to resume collection activities” which led to additional delays after the suspension was lifted.
“Many of these issues, I think it’s over 90% of these overpayments were prior to this administration and during the pandemic,” Wu said. “Many of them may have been fraudulent. I can’t go back in time to change what was done. But I think we’re focused on doing our very best to recover as much as possible going forward.
“Some of these unpursued claims are very old. So even if we had been able to take action slightly earlier, many of these payments are not recoverable because they’re older,” Wu said.
“Obviously if actions had been taken closer in time to those overpayments, perhaps more of them could have been recovered. But I couldn’t have taken any action before that, before that 2023 window,” when the legal suspension was lifted, she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Meanwhile, some Marylanders are getting hit with notices saying that they owe money to the state for unemployment benefits, some that date back during the COVID-19 pandemic years.
Wu acknowledges that the notices from so far back are likely leading to confusion among Marylanders, especially those who may have been subjected to identity theft and fraud, which was prevalent during the pandemic.
The audit comes just days before the start of the 2026 General Assembly, when lawmakers will be grappling with an estimated $1.6 billion deficit as they prepare the fiscal 2027 budget.
It’s not clear how much the unrecoverable funds were lost state dollars. Wu says that that most of the lost funds were federal COVID-19 assistance, so the lost dollars would “not impact” the Maryland unemployment insurance fund.
“Because of the overwhelming majority of benefits during that time were special federal benefits, even if they are recovered, they go immediately back to the U.S. Treasury,” she said.
Hettleman is skeptical, especially as the state faces a $1.6 billion budget shortfall. Every state dollar counts.
“There was quite a bit of delay in trying to get that money back and determine whether the state actually overpaid people,” she said. “I still have concerns in why did it take so long for the department to take some action to address those issues. And I don’t have a good answer to that right now, but we will try to get one.”
The audit also found additional oversight issues involving potentially fraudulent unemployment benefit payments, as well as two cyber security-related findings that are redacted from public view.

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)As Maryland’s General Assembly convenes its 448th session on Jan. 14, state lawmakers face enormous challenges that demand more cooperation and less confrontation. Continued political acrimony will get us nowhere.
If polarization remains our default mode of governance, Maryland, and the nation, will pay the price. It is time to stop ignoring those with whom we disagree and start rebuilding the quiet, essential skill that democracy depends on — compromise.
Politics has always been the art of reconciling competing interests for the greater good. Otto von Bismarck, Germany’s first chancellor, famously called politics “the art of the possible.” That phrase captures a truth we seem to have forgotten, that progress in a representative government does not come from ideological purity but from pragmatic dealmaking. People elect leaders not to win arguments, but to solve problems.
And there are plenty of problems in need of solving. Maryland enters this legislative session with a projected $1.4 billion budget gap and mounting financial pressures. Inflation continues to drive up the cost of goods, services and government programs such as Medicaid. Tariffs on imported materials, still affecting manufacturing and construction sectors, have added strain.
Meanwhile, local economies struggle, schools need reform and households face affordability challenges in everything from housing to health care. These issues cross political boundaries. They demand balanced, thoughtful solutions, not partisan trench warfare.

Unfortunately, the political climate across the country has grown toxic. Too often, lawmakers and citizens alike treat compromise as betrayal. But real political maturity means recognizing that democracy is not a zero-sum game. The late President Ronald Reagan, no stranger to battles over policy, put it plainly: “I’d rather get 80% of what I want than go over the cliff with my flag flying.”
His wisdom rings true today. Refusing to settle for anything less than total victory undermines both progress and public trust.
Effective governance requires legislators to listen, even to those they profoundly disagree with. Maryland’s elected leaders must resist the easy path of partisan posturing and instead engage in the hard, necessary work of consensus-building. They will soon have to make tough choices about spending priorities, economic growth, and investment in education, transportation and public safety. These choices will not please everyone. Yet, the measure of success should not be which side “wins” the argument, but whether Marylanders are better off once the legislative dust settles.
Partisan bickering is not strategy, it’s stagnation. The refusal to compromise creates gridlock, frustrates citizens, and erodes faith in institutions. Practical problem solving, on the other hand, requires a willingness to engage constructively and respectfully. Leaders who can speak across divides without abandoning their convictions are rare, but they are indispensable to restoring civility and functionality in public life.
As this session begins, both the House and Senate must rediscover that spirit of respect and reason. Politics will always involve disagreement, but disagreement need not become hostility. When legislators meet each other with humility instead of suspicion, they create space for genuine understanding, and ultimately, progress.
The stakes could not be higher. Beyond the fiscal challenges, Maryland’s broader well-being depends on our ability to govern through consensus rather than combat. A state that leads with cooperation can weather federal headwinds, attract investment, and inspire confidence in its people. A state that succumbs to perpetual division risks stagnation and decline.
We Marylanders may be in different boats, urban, suburban or rural, but we share the same pond. When those waters become turbulent, all of us are affected. The only way to steady them is together.
Compromise is not weakness. It is the highest form of political strength. It demands courage, empathy, and pragmatism, the very qualities that have carried Maryland through crises and define the best of our public service traditions. As the new legislative session begins, may our leaders remember that politics, at its best, remains the art of the possible, and that the possible begins when divisiveness ends.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_0510-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-10 00:58:04.466867

Canady left the court as his wife, Rep. Jennifer Canady, R-Lakeland, is in line to become speaker of the Florida House after the 2028 elections and before he was age-limited off the court. He became director and a professor at the University of Florida Hamilton School for Classical and Civic Education on Jan. 1.
This could be the final Supreme Court appointment Gov. Ron DeSantis makes before he leaves office in about a year. Since taking office in January 2019, he has overhauled the court’s jurisprudence, creating an institution willing to jettison even longstanding precedent on abortion and capital punishment in the interest of conservative ends. He was assisted by the age-related retirements of the court’s moderate-to-liberal block.
Once the Judicial Nominating Commission submitted its candidates on Dec. 30, the governor had 60 days to appoint a qualified candidate — that is, by the end of February. The panel vets applicants for selection by the governor.
All six of the candidates are affiliated with the Federalist Society, as is the governor himself. The Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies is a conservative-libertarian organization that promotes an “originalist” or “textualist” approach to jurisprudence. In practice, that means members tend to oppose economic regulation, affirmative action, and marriage equality and to support states’ rights an expansive reading of presidential power. Membership is a way for young attorneys to establish their bona fides with the conservative legal movement.
The sitting court comprises two white men, two white women, an Hispanic man, and a Black woman.

Adam Tanenbaum

Adam Tanenbaum has served in all three branches of state government. He is a judge on the First District Court of Appeal, the most important state court aside from the Supreme Court itself, as it adjudicates cases arising from state law and policy.
He’s worked as an adjunct professor at the Stetson University College of Law, served a four-month stint as general counsel for the Republican Party of Florida, as a public defender, as chief deputy solicitor general in the Florida Department of Legal Affairs, and as general counsel for the Florida House and Department of State before becoming judge in the First District.
Has has taught at the Florida State University and University of Florida colleges of law.
“I would bring a deep-seated, long-standing principled commitment to ‘original meaning’ as a judicial philosophy in the faithful adherence to constitutional and statutory text while deciding cases,” Tanenbaum wrote in his application. “I also would bring a non-expansive approach to deciding cases and would seek to limit adjudication of a case, as much as possible, to the facts that are in the record before the court.”
A 1996 Georgetown University Law Center graduate, Tanenbaum graduated from high school in Pinellas County. He attended UF for his undergraduate degree.
At UF and Georgetown, he was in the Federalist Society. At Georgetown he was in the Republican Law Students Association and served as president of the Jewish Law Students Association.
He is still a member of the Federalist Society.
The appeals judge applied for the Florida Supreme Court in 2022 and the JNC certified his name to the governor as a nominee. 
Tanenbaum was general counsel to the Florida House during Republican Richard Corcoran’s speakership, which ran from 2016 through 2018.
He said in his JNC application last month that he is most proud of his service as a public defender and as counsel to the Florida House, which he described as a “dream job.” Corcoran and his chief of staff comprised “one of the best clients I could have mainly because they really wanted to be bold, they really wanted to do bold things and they let me be creative and think of new solutions to problems using wit and legal argument to accomplish what they were trying to accomplish.”
Tanenbaum pointed to the significance of DeSantis’ Supreme Court picks.
“This is his 8th pick, presumably his last and it’s probably his capstone appointment to solidify what he’s accomplished in the last seven years in remaking the court. My reasons for applying though are the same as they were before. I’m answering the call from the governor for qualified applicants,” Tanenbaum said.
Tanenbaum was primary counsel in Corcoran’s lawsuit against the Florida Lottery over a vendor contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars that would have vastly increased the number of lottery machines above the number authorized by law. The Lottery ultimately settled the case. 
In another case, Tannenbaum represented the Rick Scott administration in defending the state’s refusal to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states — after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld marriage equality. The state lost.
As a judge, he heard Byrd v. Black Voters Matter Capacity Bldg. Inst. (2022 and 2025), a high-profile challenge to a redistricting plan that eliminated minority-access voting districts. The state ultimately prevailed.
In 2024, his income was $215,750, including payment from part-time soccer refereeing.
Tanenbaum’s net worth as of Dec. 31, 2024 was $1.34 million.

Gannam earned his bachelor’s at the University of North Florida and went on to graduate from the UF College of Law and mostly worked as an attorney in Jacksonville and Maitland before being appointed to serve on the Sixth District Court of Appeals in Lakeland, the post he now holds.
Gannam said his son’s cancer diagnosis in 2003 shaped the way he serves as a judge. He had, he said, “to make weighty decisions under pressure, decisions about his treatment and exposure to the world outside the hospital where his life was at stake. Careful consideration of all information and maintaining composure under duress were essential to making the right decisions and generating confidence in them.”
Gannam’s last job was at Liberty Counsel, which litigates on behalf of an “historically Christian and biblical” worldview, according to its webpage.
“It is no doubt clear from my application that much of my prior public service and legal advocacy has a distinctively Christian bent,” he said.
“My public interest litigation in constitutional religious liberty cases was personally rewarding because it integrated my faith and my passion for the rule of law, which are central aspects of my life and vocation. But my faith-based associations have never required or tempted me to advance legal positions that are not supported by the law.”
The first reference he listed on his application was Florida Supreme Court Justice Meredith Sasso. He told the JNC that he hopes to emulate Sasso, who held the judgeship he now holds.
Other references include Republican state Sen. Clay Yarborough and Republican state Rep. and Speaker-designate Sam Garrison, and Joshua Mize, another candidate for the Supreme Court this round. Another reference is Jeff Aaron, legal counsel to Hope Florida Foundation during its scandal and who has worked closely with the DeSantis administration in legal actions. 
Gannam has been a Federalist Society member since 2020.
From 2014-2023, he provided pro bono representation to individuals and organizations in “public interest, religious liberty litigation.”
In 2015, he wrote a column in the Florida Times-Union titled, “LGBT people in Jacksonville do not need a Human Rights Ordinance.” That column declared, “Wherever LGBT ‘rights’ laws are passed, discrimination against people of faith follows.”
“A large majority of Duval County believes in the historical definition of marriage — unchanged worldwide for millennia — the union of a man and a woman. But anyone who dares express this traditional belief in a consensual conversation with a coworker or customer is guilty if  ‘discrimination’ is perceived by someone overhearing it.”
He represented members of the military in a class action challenging COVID-19 vaccine mandates during the pandemic. Those cases were eventually dismissed as moot when the vaccine policies were rescinded.
His net worth as of the end of 2024 was $205,715.
He made $206,504 in 2024 and was set to make about the same in 2025.
John Guard

John Guard (Photo via Guard’s LinkedIn profile)
John Guard has worked in the Florida attorney general’s office since 2018 as senior counsel, chief deputy attorney general, acting attorney general, and chief deputy attorney general.
He took a brief hiatus from the AG’s office last fall while he awaited a nomination from President Donald Trump to the Middle District of Florida. Axios reported that nomination has been hung up because of his association with the Hope Florida scandal.
According to his application, in July he met with an investigator with the Second Circuit state attorney’s office “because I was a witness in connection to the transfer of $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation from a settlement agreement with Centene Corporation.”
“My involvement in that settlement was limited to signing a settlement agreement after obtaining the Attorney General’s approval and a handful of emails. In October, the State Attorney contacted and told me that I was a witness in the matter, not a target, and that I had fully cooperated and provided truthful and complete information. I expect that investigation to be completed shortly.”
Law 360 reported Wednesday that Guard’s federal court nomination was not renewed for the new congressional session. Guard told the JNC that his preference is to serve on the Florida Supreme Court. 
His top references were U.S. Sen. and former Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, followed by Tampa Republican U.S. Rep. Laurel Lee and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
Guard graduated from Tulane University School of Law in 2000. He earned his bachelor’s degree from Florida State University in 1993.
He was assistant U.S. attorney in the Middle District of Florida, Jacksonville Division, from 2009-2012, working on fraud, narcotics, unlawful firearms, and violent crime. He spent two stints at Holland & Knight in Tampa. 
Guard has been in the Federalist Society since 2023. He is a committee member for the Tampa Bay-area Boy Scouts council. 
Guard said he hopes to emulate the late Justice Antonin Scalia. 
“I was recently reading an article where it said his name was invoked in Supreme Court arguments more than any other name, and that’s because of his courage, and because of his intellect and because of how willing he was to stand on his principles,” Guard told the commission. 
If he has any disagreements with Scalia, it would be on his interpretation of the First Amendment. Guard said he disagreed with Scalia’s ruling in Texas v. Johnson, in which the justice protected the burning of the American Flag. “He often was siding with the more liberal justices of the Supreme Court when it came to the First Amendment,” Guard said.
He’s represented the state in several-high profile cases, including the case against Purdue Pharma alleging damages from opioid use in the state. That ended with a $680 million settlement with Walgreen in 2022. He led negotiations for cities and counties receiving that settlement money and for a separate $26 billion settlement with other major pharmaceutical companies. In all, according to his application, the state will receive $3.15 billion from opioid settlements.
He represented the state in a suit filed by Planned Parenthood challenging the state’s 15-week abortion ban and in litigation between the state and Juul, alleging the company marketed vaping equipment to children. Juul settled for $79 million. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the state’s 15-week abortion ban.
Guard’s income in 2024 was $197,371 and his net worth as of November was $1.55 million.

“I have been a law enforcement officer and worked the ground level of our judicial system. I have managed complex and highly sensitive national security matters involving Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters and have worked as a civil litigator in state and federal proceedings.”
Long graduated from FSU with a bachelor’s in finance (2003), the UF College of Law (2008), and U.S. Navy Officer Development School (2008).
At UF, he was president of the Federalist Society. He was also a member of UF Law School Republicans and FSU College Republicans.
He was Tallahassee Federalist Society president 2015-2016 and is still a member. 
Long now serves as a judge for the First District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee and has held that position since 2020. 
Immediately before that, he was a judge in in Tallahassee for Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit Court.

From 2008-2013, he was a U.S. Navy Judge Advocate.
“I have spent the last 24 years of my life working through the great breadth of our justice system. My experience is not confined to one or two areas of the law and includes years of labor in the very-real daily work of those asked to breathe life into the opinions written by our appellate courts. This experiences will be a great asset on the court. Putting a wide variety of experience on the court is important to maintaining a thoughtful and skilled judiciary,” he wrote.
He’s been an assistant scoutmaster for a Tallahassee troop since 2021 and is a youth baseball, soccer, basketball, and flag football coach in Tallahassee.
In 2024 he made $236,034. His reported net worth is $409,494.

Samuel Salario (Photo via Florida Second District Court of Appeal)
Samuel J. Salario Jr. graduated from the University of Florida College of Law (1995) and holds a bachelor’s degree from The American University (1992).
In 2018 and 2019, he submitted applications to the Florida Supreme Court Judicial Nominating Commission. The JNC certified him for a nomination in 2018. 
“I regard the rule of law as possibly the greatest gift ever bestowed upon a political community. Liberty, human dignity, and economic prosperity are nurtured and shielded when the rules that govern us are rational, procedurally regular, and neutrally applied. This demands a judiciary that is respectful of decisions that are committed to the political branches of government, resolves disputes on legal principles openly explained and defended, and that is prepared to correct its own errors,” he wrote in his application. 
Most recently, he has worked as an attorney, but spent 2015-2020 as a Rick Scott appointee to the Second District Court of Appeal of Florida. Now, he’s a shareholder at Lawson Huck Gonzalez. Former Justice Alan Lawson and Paul C. Huck, shareholders at that firm, were his first references in his application to the court.  
“My most important potential contributions are the characteristics I hope I developed a reputation for as a Second District judge and that I have tried to promote in my current role, both in the cases I work on and the amicus briefs I do pro bono: an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, discipline and diligence in decision making, and respect for the people the courts serve,” he wrote. 
He spent two years as underwriting manager for a litigation finance firm from 2020-2022 and, earlier, spent 13 years at Carlton Fields in Tampa, mostly as a shareholder. 
His current practice involves “handling state and federal appeals across a broad range of subjects, including government and political disputes, criminal prosecutions, business disputes, class actions, estates and trusts, and amicus briefing in matters of interest,” he wrote in his application.
At UF, he was a member of the Federalist Society. In his professional career, he joined in 2015 and has been a member since. 
Among the nominees, Salario has the only notable presence on X.
In July, he replied to a post asking what late night talk show hosts Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, and Stephen Colbert have in common. “Low T.” he replied.
In September, in advance of the federal government shutdown, he replied to a video from Trump’s account that criticized U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.
A screenshot from Salario’s X account.
“Dear President Trump: The country desperately needs a Hakeem Jeffries sombrero meme with Mexican Radio by Wall of Voodoo as the operative music. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Salario wrote.
In another, he posted a photo in response to an article about former President Joe Biden’s sex life.
In 2024, he made $534,551. His net worth as of December was $5 million, the highest among the nominees. 
He wrote a brief for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America in litigation opposing Amendment 4, the proposed 2024 constitutional amendment to make legal access to abortion.

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Hundreds of people gathered at the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Friday night to protest the recent killing of a women by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis.
Renee Nicole Good died on Wednesday after an ICE agent shot her through her car window. Her death, as well as another shooting by federal agents in Portland on Thursday, prompted demonstrations across the country against ICE.
Federal officials have accused Good of attempting to run over an ICE agent ahead of the shooting, but local and national leaders dispute that claim based on videos of the incident.
Good was from Colorado Springs and was living in Minneapolis.

Activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was recently released after a nine-month detention at an ICE facility in Aurora, addressed the crowd from the steps of the Capitol. Protestors spilled into Lincoln Street between 14th and Colfax avenues and onto the snowy lawn, prompting road closures in the nearby blocks.
“People are ready for a revolution. People are ready to stop ICE,” Vizguerra said, leading chants of “Free them all,” referring to detained immigrants, and encouraging people to protect one another as they continue protests.

The group marched from the Capitol down the 16th Street pedestrian mall towards Union Station. Protestors told Newsline that they thought Good’s death was “criminal” and it felt the federal government is “covering it up” with its insistence that the shooting was in self defense.
Gov. Jared Polis called for an investigation into the shooting in a statement this week.
“What took place in a Minneapolis neighborhood is deeply disturbing, and the loss of Renee Good is tragic. My thoughts are with Renee’s family, especially her young child, friends, and loved ones including those in Colorado,” he said. “The American people deserve answers about what happened.”
More protests and vigils are planned in Colorado for this weekend, including on Sunday at the ICE office in Centennial. The protests follow previous demonstrations in Colorado and across the county over the past year against the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.

Loneliness and love,Anna Wolfe,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/09/disgraced-welfare-director-takes-stand/,"FILE - John Davis, former director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, leaves the Thad Cochran United States Courthouse in Jackson, Miss., Thursday, Sept. 22, 2022. Mississippi's largest public corruption case, in which tens of millions of dollars earmarked for needy families was misspent, involves a number of sports figures with ties to the sta[...]","Since he was arrested nearly six years ago for diverting millions of federal welfare dollars away from the needy, former Mississippi Department of Human Services director John Davis took the witness stand for the first time Friday.
He is the fourth witness to testify in the trial of a man he said he loved, former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr., who received more than $3 million in welfare funds during Davis’ administration. The testimony was dominated by Davis’ text messages with DiBiase and others, displayed in the courtroom using a projector. 
“There is nothing you could ever do to make me not love you,” read one text from Davis to the wrestler.
The two men even came up with a catchphrase using a combination of their names, “#DaViase4Lyfe,” which they’d sometimes use at the end of their text messages. Like “Bennifer,” the prosecutor noted.
The story told through the texts is one of a bromance with a tragic end. Davis is awaiting federal sentencing for conspiracy and theft and in DiBiase’s trial for conspiracy, wire fraud, theft and money laundering, he could face decades if convicted on all 13 counts.

But after six hours of showing Davis text after text, the federal government hadn’t finished with him. And the defense hadn’t taken their turn to question Davis. What the court heard from Davis Friday is an incomplete account from Davis. He is scheduled to return to the stand Monday. 
Still, the prosecution did start to prod at one of the case’s main mysteries: Davis’ motive. 
Davis testified that his introduction to the DiBiase family was through the youngest brother, Brett DiBiase, then a Toshiba salesman who had also been a wrestler. They’d run into each other having lunch one day and Brett DiBiase’s relative, a lobbyist, introduced the men. The agency quickly hired Brett DiBiase and he and the director became “very, very close,” Davis said.
“Were you in love with him?” Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie asked.
“I loved him but not ‘in love’ with him if you’re asking the way I think you’re asking,” Davis responded. “I had no sexual desire toward Brett, but I loved him a whole lot.”

Brett DiBiase soon introduced Davis to his brother and his father, Ted DiBiase Sr., another former WWE star who ran an evangelical Christian ministry called Heart of David. Davis exercised unilateral control over the spending of a roughly $1 billion state agency, and they all began working together.
Davis testified that his agency contracted with Heart of David to satisfy a faith-based initiative that then-Gov. Phil Bryant, Davis’ boss, wanted the agency to support.
Around this time, Davis had also begun pushing tens of millions of federal welfare dollars to two nonprofits – Mississippi Community Education Center and Family Resource Center – to run a nebulous statewide anti-poverty initiative called Families First for Mississippi. Meynardie asked if this was part of Republican Bryant’s directive to “privatize” the agency.

“The administration liked to call it consolidation because it sounds better,” Davis said. 
But after the nonprofits received the funding, Davis testified that he often dictated what they did with the money, including giving it to his wrestler friends.
After a while of employing Brett DiBiase, Davis said, “it became really difficult for me to sit on Brett, because he was so high-strung.” 
Brett DiBiase was in recovery from drug addiction when they met, Davis said, but he relapsed. Davis dropped Brett DiBiase as an employee of his agency and helped get him a job at one of the Families First nonprofits instead. The wrestler’s salary jumped from under $100,000 at the state to $250,000 at Mississippi Community Education Center. 
Davis also testified that he accompanied Brett DiBiase on a trip to New Orleans to visit DiBiase’s extramarital girlfriend and twice on runs to meet the wrestler’s drug dealer. The prosecution asked directly if Davis had sexual relations with the younger brother and Davis said he had not. When Brett DiBiase agreed to return to rehab, he went to a luxury treatment facility in Malibu, California, on the nonprofit’s dime.
Had the nonprofits attempted to cut off the spigot to Brett DiBiase, Davis testified he would have tried to talk to them to keep the payments flowing.
“The million dollar question: Why?” Meynardie asked.
This is when Davis explained that he had no spouse, no children and few friends – a hazard, he said, of working at the state agency – and that Brett DiBiase, “he was like, I was going to say a brother, but more like a child.”
Throughout 2017, Davis began turning his attention – and finances – to the older brother, Teddy DiBiase, who lavished Davis with words.
“I don’t have enough room nor adequate words to describe the amazingness that makes up the DNA of your very being,” DiBiase once texted the director in late 2017. “… I don’t know where you came from or what we did to deserve such an honor to do life with you.”
By 2018, they were attending workouts together and moved into a swanky new office with valet parking in downtown Jackson. Together, they cooked up idea after idea. A statewide self-help lecture program. A program for inner-city youth. A feeding program. Something called “Jesse gym.”
If DiBiase could take the concepts he created during his time with the welfare program and make them unique, the two men hoped they could go into business together and sell the product to other states.
“I set (sic) up at night dreaming shit. But remember for us dreams are reality cause with Gods help all things are possible,” Davis once texted DiBiase. The texts were heavy with talk of faith and prayer.
Davis testified that he planned to leave the agency at the end of 2018 and part of his efforts with DiBiase were so there would be something waiting for him in retirement. They even mused about purchasing a property – the “DaViase Farm.”
“You’re talking about generational security?” the prosecutor asked, and Davis confirmed.
The prosecution asked if Davis’ newfound ventures with Teddy DiBiase made his brother jealous. “Yes sir, there was always some tension there,” Davis said.
The discussions weren’t always about grand visions. Sometimes they were about more tangible desires. Davis testified that the day after Teddy DiBiase received a $1 million agreement in May of 2018, the wrestler bought a truck. “That truck looks good with you on it,” Davis texted.
“I LOOOOOOOOVE THIS THING,” DiBiase responded. “And I love you John Davis more.”
But all while Davis was ensuring Teddy DiBiase in text messages of future grant funding “that will provide you with a level of security that I promised you,” he at times sang a different tune with the nonprofit directors.
“It bothers me that I allowed these guys to gain access and it feels like they are using,” Davis texted the Families First nonprofit directors. He was referring to DiBiase and friends of the wrestler that Davis had also allowed to the welfare trough. 
In another text, Davis wrote, “It’s frustrating how these people think they are so talented they need big money and then don’t do anything.”
At one point, Davis said he surmised that the nonprofit directors were hesitant about cutting off funding for DiBiase’s friend, who was not performing under his contract, because they thought doing so would upset Davis. The director wanted to assure them he was on the side of accountability. 
“There are no sacred cows for me,” Davis texted.
“But there were two sacred cows, weren’t there?” Meynardie asked Davis Friday.
Davis replied: “There were.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/09172609/AP22276452381257.jpg,,,2026-01-09 22:56:43.686130

Bob Ferguson speaks to reporters during the annual legislative session preview in Olympia, Wash., on Jan. 9, 2026. (Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson likely violated state laws by allowing his former top adviser, Mike Webb, to travel with him on a state plane to the Tri-Cities last summer, the state Executive Ethics Board ruled Friday.
In a unanimous vote, the board concluded there was “reasonable cause” to believe Ferguson ran afoul of Washington’s ethics laws by using state resources for the private benefit of a non-state employee.
Ferguson provided “a special privilege” to Webb by allowing him to travel on the Washington State Patrol aircraft, wrote agency executive director Kate Reynolds in her recommendation to the board.
Under the statute, the board will hold a hearing at which the governor can contest the charges either in person or through written testimony. The board will then decide whether a violation occurred and a penalty or other enforcement action is required.
A spokesperson for the governor did not immediately respond for comment.
Ferguson told the ethics board investigators last year that use of state resources was “de minimis in nature” and not for private gain, and he asked for the matter to be dismissed.

The Executive Ethics Board received a complaint July 30, 2025 alleging that the governor violated provisions of the Ethics in Public Service Act by letting Webb travel with him to the Tri-Cities. The June 26 trip, which included official business and a political fundraiser, was first reported by Axios.
Webb, Ferguson’s longtime friend and closest political confidant, served as the governor’s chief strategy officer until resigning in March amid complaints that he fomented a hostile workplace. 
In a staff meeting in mid-July, Ferguson addressed the trip, apologized and called his decision to let Webb fly on the plane “pretty stupid.”
In a written response, Ferguson also told the board’s investigators that, “Allowing an individual to travel as a guest neither interfered with official duties nor provided that individual with any improper advantage derived from state office.” 
“The flight in question was not at capacity,” Ferguson wrote. “The individual’s presence did not displace any state employee. It did not create additional cost in terms of fuel, staffing, or time. The state incurred no financial burden or misuse of taxpayer resources.”
Webb told The Seattle Times last year he sat on a seat over the plane’s toilet.
The travel “imposed no cost, no operational burden, and no impact on state functions,” he added. “Incidental or negligible use that does not result in added expense or harm to the public interest does not rise to the level of an ethics violation.”
The Washington State Patrol told investigators that aircraft costs are calculated on a per-flight-hour basis. If multiple agencies are using the plane, the tab is divided evenly by the number of passengers, and each passenger, or their agency, is billed for their share.
For the June 26 trip, the aircraft was only used by the governor’s office, so the aircraft cost was billed per flight hour. The report did not list the actual charge.

Bingham is the chief financial officer of Bingham Ventures, “a family-operated development organization, where she supports their financial management and the company’s commitment to community-minded development,” according to a press release from the governor’s office.
State Rep. Wendy Horman, co-chair of budget committee, to resign from Idaho Legislature

Horman, an experienced and powerful state legislator who has served as one of the architects of the state budget, announced Dec. 19 that she would resign from the Idaho Legislature to accept a position with the federal government in Washington, D.C. Rep. Josh Tanner, R-Eagle, was named as her replacement as co-chair of the Legislature’s budget committee on Monday.
Bingham and her husband, Val, have four children and reside in Idaho Falls, according to the release.
“Bingham is an active member of the Idaho Falls community, staying engaged over the years by volunteering at her children’s schools and serving in leadership roles through parent-teacher organizations and neighborhood groups,” the release said.
In the press release, Bingham said she was honored to represent the eastern Idaho legislative district.
“I sincerely appreciate Representative Wendy Horman for her years of commitment to our state and look forward to building on her legacy of service,” she said in the release. “I am thankful for this incredible opportunity and am excited to get to work.”
Bingham will serve the remainder of Horman’s term, which ends Nov. 30, 2026. All 105 legislative seats are up for re-election for two-year terms this year.
When there is a vacancy in the Legislature, Idaho Code states that the political party of the lawmaker who vacated the position will submit a list of three names to the governor for consideration.
“Bonneville County Republicans submitted a list of names to Governor Little for appointment, consistent with Idaho law,” the press release said.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)Attorney General Alan Wilson announced Friday picking state Sen. Mike Reichenbach as his running mate, becoming the first of seven candidates for governor to complete his campaign ticket.
The pair will first campaign together at a meet-and-greet event Monday evening in Florence.
Reichenbach, 54, brings a business background to the ticket and diversity to the governor’s race, both as the field’s lone Black Republican and only person from the Pee Dee.
In picking Reichenbach, Wilson also chose someone with a compelling personal story who’s still relatively new to politics. The car dealership owner was first elected to the Senate in March 2022 to fill the unexpired term of the late Senate Finance Chairman Hugh Leatherman following his death at age 90.
Four years after Reichenbach successfully campaigned as a “political outsider” for the seat Leatherman held for 41 years, he’s still been in elected office less than any of the Republicans running for governor. Wilson has been the state’s chief prosecutor since 2010.
While his announcement is a first for the race, it’s been in the works for months.
Reichenbach told the SC Daily Gazette that Wilson approached him last summer about joining his ticket. He didn’t specify when, but that means it was early into Wilson’s own campaign, which he officially launched last June.
Reichenbach said he was honored but needed to think about it. He eventually decided his experiences, particularly as a business owner, could help South Carolinians.
He recounted his early days in business during the Great Recession.
“I know what it’s like to lay awake at night and be unsure if you could make payroll and to have to lay employees off and to have to struggle as a small business,” he said. “I fight for small businesses because I am one.”
The lieutenant governor’s job is considered part-time. The job duties are largely whatever the person in the governor’s office decides.
The role used to include presiding over the Senate and overseeing the Office on Aging. But those responsibilities were taken away by the constitutional change approved by voters in 2012 to take the post off the ballot as a separately elected office.
That change didn’t take effect until the 2018 governor’s race, when Gov. Henry McMaster’s running mate, Pam Evette, became the first lieutenant governor in state history to be elected as part of a joint ticket.
Eight years later, Evette is among the four other Republicans and two Democrats running for governor who have yet to publicly pick their choice for lieutenant governor. The primaries are still five months away.
Reichenbach, a father of two, said he hoped to use the job as a metaphorical megaphone to advocate for issues that are deeply personal for him.
That includes making adoptions easier and more affordable and helping youth in foster care avoid prison time.
Like Wilson, the adopted son of U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, Reichenbach was adopted as a child. During an abortion debate in 2023, he offered the most heartfelt explanation for supporting the six-week ban that took effect later that year.
His mother was 14 in 1971 when she became pregnant by her 15-year-old boyfriend, he said on the Senate floor, adding he’s here because she put him up for adoption.
On Friday, Reichenbach said he wants to take care of all families, not just “the typical Norman Rockwall perfect family.”
“We do have a bond,” Reichenbach said of Wilson. “We both feel passionately that we need to work to make the family unit stronger, but we also need to have a special focus on those that have no or have a little voice — those 3,300 children in foster care, that was me at one point. That could have been him at one point.”
The other Republicans campaigning for the Governor’s Mansion are U.S. Reps. Nancy Mace of Charleston County and Ralph Norman of Rock Hill, and state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Amid stalled state negotiations over how to share the Colorado River’s dwindling water supply, the Bureau of Reclamation on Friday released a range of options that will serve as the foundation for how to manage the river’s largest reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell.
The highly anticipated 1,600-page document details five alternative proposals that will guide new water management rules to replace the current ones set to expire in August 2026. The proposals primarily focus on the operation of Lake Mead’s Hoover Dam and Lake Powell’s Glen Canyon Dam.
The seven states that share the river’s flows have been deadlocked for nearly two years over how to govern the waterway through the coming decades — even as water levels at Lake Mead and Lake Powell are forecasted to reach record lows after two straight years of disappointing snowpack across the West.
The alternatives include a compliance option that could be implementable in 2027 if states can’t reach a seven-state agreement on how to share the river’s water supply, however under that alternative Nevada, Arizona, and California would face water shortages up to 1.48 million acre-feet.
“The Department of the Interior is moving forward with this process to ensure environmental compliance is in place so operations can continue without interruption when the current guidelines expire,” Andrea Travnicek, the department’s assistant secretary for water and science, said in a news release Friday. “The river and the 40 million people who depend on it cannot wait. In the face of an ongoing severe drought, inaction is not an option.”
Any guidelines adopted for post-2026 Colorado River operations are likely to face an early test with forecasts anticipating low elevations at Lake Powell and Lake Mead in 2027. Lakes Powell and Mead are currently less than two-thirds full, while projections show the river’s inflow next year is likely to be 27% lower than normal.
Without a strong winter snow season, it’s possible Lake Powell’s levels could drop low enough to cease hydropower production by next October — a scenario that would also limit the department’s ability to send water downstream to Nevada, Arizona, and California.
Negotiations between federal officials and the seven western states that rely on the Colorado River have largely remained behind closed doors since 2023, but any new operating rules are required to go through a public environmental review process before a final decision can be made.
The proposals released Friday were part of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process, which includes a Draft Environmental Impact Statement analyzing the impacts of the proposals. 
Several river negotiators said they have not yet reviewed the lengthy document published late Friday, and could not give a detailed analysis of the proposals.
“We are reviewing the draft EIS, and we expect to be in a position to provide comments next week. We’d like to give a thorough review before we comment,” said Bronson Mack, a spokesperson for Nevada’s chief river negotiator and general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority John Entsminger.
Utah’s chief river negotiator Gene Shawcroft echoed those comments.
“The Authority will take the time necessary to fully evaluate the document before offering detailed comments,” Shawcroft said in a statement.
Shawcroft called the release of the draft environmental impact statement for post-2026 Colorado River operations “an important milestone in a complex and consequential process.”
“The Authority looks forward to carefully reviewing the draft and continuing to work with our Basin State partners, water users, Tribes, and the Bureau of Reclamation to help ensure future operations protect Utah water users, support the environment, and reflect Utah’s priorities,” he continued.
In an unusual move, the draft environmental impact statement did not identify which set of operating guidelines the federal government would prefer. A preferred alternative is typically included in environmental reviews. 
“Given the importance of a consensus-based approach to operations for the stability of the system, Reclamation has not yet identified a preferred alternative,” said Acting Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Scott Cameron in a statement Friday.
However, the draft environmental review does include a broad range of possible alternatives designed to enable states to continue working towards a seven-state consensus agreement on how to share the river’s shrinking water supply.
“Reclamation anticipates that when an agreement is reached, it will incorporate elements or variations of these five alternatives and will be fully analyzed in the Final EIS enabling the sustainable and effective management of the Colorado River,” Cameron said.
States’ last chance to share a final consensus-based plan will be mid-February 2026 in order to reach a final agreement in the summer,  with implementation of the new guidelines beginning in October 2026.
States along the Colorado River have been split into two camps for months over how to manage the river after 2026: Arizona, California, and Nevada in the Lower Basin; and Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming in the Upper Basin.
One of the biggest disagreements between the Upper and Lower Basin states is over which faction should have to cut back on their water use, and by how much.
Lower Basin states want all seven Colorado River states to share mandatory water cuts during dry years under the new guidelines. The Upper Basin, which is not subject to mandatory cuts under current guidelines, say they already use much less water than downstream states and should not face additional cuts.
The public comment period on the post-2026 alternatives runs from Jan. 16 to March 2. The federal agency will also host two virtual meetings to share more details on the draft, scheduled for Jan. 29 and Feb. 10.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/091925_S-Utah-Stock_03-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 20:12:10.409715

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The head of the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration said the state won’t pay the lawyer hired by the corrections board to represent it in lawsuits against the governor.
Jim Hudson said in a letter Tuesday to the Department of Corrections that paying attorney Abtin Mehdizadegan $300,000 would violate state law and Arkansas’ constitution, saying that the board did not follow state procurement procedures.
The rejection is the latest setback for the Board of Corrections which has been embroiled in a legal fight for over two years with Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders over who controls the state’s prison system. Disputes over how and whether to pay Mehdizadegan has been part of litigation that’s spawned from that power struggle.
Hudson’s rationale for denying the payment is similar to arguments Attorney General Tim Griffin has made in court — the board did not follow state law when it hired the outside lawyer, his letter said.
“The Board is obligated to follow state procurement law just as any other agency governed by constitutional provisions are so obligated,” Hudson wrote, citing the state Game and Fish Commission and higher education institutions as examples. “DFA cannot pay invoices for services that were not lawfully procured.”
Mehdizadegan and a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
The fight over control of the prison system began in 2023 when the panel fired Sanders’ pick for Corrections Secretary, Joe Profiri. When Profiri asserted that only Sanders could fire him due to changes in state law, the board — which is created by the constitution, not state law — hired Mehdizadegan and sued.
The board has argued that the changes Sanders signed into law violated Amendment 33 of the Arkansas Constitution by shifting oversight of the corrections system from it to the governor. A state judge last year agreed, finding those laws unconstitutional.
Mehdizadegan’s hire quickly became its own legal battle when Griffin sued over it, saying board members violated procurement  law and the Freedom of Information Act they hired Mehdizadegan.
Court rulings last year appeared to clear the way for the board to pay the attorney. 
In his letter this week, Hudson also wrote the Department of Corrections does not have funds appropriated to cover the bill. Under the state’s constitution, paying those invoices would require legislative approval. 
The denial came after multiple communications from board member Lee Watson — who, as an attorney himself, also acts as the board’s legal liaison — to Hudson in the weeks after a Dec. 16 meeting where the board voted a second time to pay Mehdizadegan, after department staff raised concerns that the state would not pay the invoices.
Hudson also wrote that the laws the board sued over were not factors in whether the bills could be paid.

(Bob Wick photo/Bureau of Land Management)The state of Alaska is preparing to give away millions of dollars worth of gravel to public corporations, a move that would amount to millions of dollars in assistance to some of the state’s biggest construction projects.
According to a Q&A posted by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, the beneficiaries could include the proposed Ambler Access Project and the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline.
The state’s plans were disclosed the day before Thanksgiving in a public notice stating that DNR is planning “regulation changes on material sales and conveyances to state agencies.”
The Department of Natural Resources oversees mining on state lands in Alaska, including the extraction of gravel and fill dirt for use in construction.
While humble, gravel can be serious business — in November, DNR commissioner-designee John Crowther signed an order that prohibits gold, silver and other kinds of mining near gravel quarries along the Dalton Highway, which links Fairbanks to Prudhoe Bay. 
For state maintenance crews that need to keep the highway open, gravel is more important than rare minerals.
In 2024, High Country News reported that for construction projects on the North Slope, gravel is a “precious commodity” because of its scarcity. 
One of DNR’s proposed changes to its gravel rules declares “that the department convey material to a state agency or public corporation at a base price of $0.00 per cubic yard and without retaining a reversionary interest.”
Currently posted price charts show the state selling gravel for $3 per cubic yard in Interior Alaska. 
State law prescribes that any time DNR wants to sell land or public resources for less than market value, the commissioner must declare that the sales “serve a public purpose and are in the public interest.”
The upcoming regulation change states that transfer to a state agency or state corporation is automatically consistent with that requirement.
That would allow the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities to get gravel from state land for free, excepting the cost of processing and transportation. 
In a question and answer notice published Dec. 26, DNR said the change is intended to allow “for maximum use of state land consistent with the public interest.”
“Examples of a public purpose would be a state agency or public corporation using gravel to construct a gravel pad on a state leased site for infrastructure development; to construct a new state highway right-of-way or expand an existing state right-of-way; or to build an embankment along a river; or gravel needed for the development of a gas line right-of-way,” it wrote.
The free gravel and dirt would also be available to state-owned corporations, which is likely to affect some of the state’s biggest development projects.
The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority is developing a 211-mile road between the Dalton Highway and mine sites in northwest Alaska and would be eligible for the free rock and dirt. So would the Alaska Gasline Development Corp., which is now a junior partner in the development of the proposed trans-Alaska natural gas pipeline. 
A spokesperson for Glenfarne, the pipeline’s lead developer, said the firm did not request the regulation change.
In 2024, the Bureau of Land Management estimated that the proposed Ambler Road would need between 15 million and 22 million cubic yards of gravel, plus an additional 220,000 to 347,000 yards annually for maintenance.
If the state of Alaska provides that gravel for free, it would be a revenue loss of between $45 million and $66 million for construction alone. 
The public comment period on the change expired on Jan. 2, and it was not immediately clear when the change would take effect.
Lorraine Henry, director of communications for DNR, said by email that it isn’t yet clear how much gravel might be affected by the regulation change, and that the agency didn’t intend to benefit any specific project.
“DNR cannot speculate on the volume of gravel that may be involved, as each application from State of Alaska agencies will be evaluated on its merits – and will include a public process and follow statutory authorities,” she said.

Legislative Bill 938, the First-Time Homeowner Savings Account Act, was introduced Friday by State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse on behalf of State Treasurer Joey Spellerberg. Spellerberg took the reins of treasury in November after Tom Briese resigned.
Similar first-time homebuyer legislation was introduced last session by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. Spellerberg’s staff said it was not aware of the Cavanaugh bill when the treasurer was examining models tried in other states. Staff said LB 938 was not meant to be competing legislation, but a vehicle to address one of the largest challenges facing Nebraskans. 
While similar to Cavanaugh’s LB 151, the new proposal allows for higher savings amounts. Under LB 938, eligible individuals could contribute up to $5,000 a year and couples up to $10,000. Contributions would be deductible from adjusted gross income in Nebraska, and earnings from the savings account would be exempt from state income tax when used for homebuying expenses.

Total contributions would be capped at $50,000 for married couples and $25,000 for individuals. Impacts on the state budget would start in 2027, when the bill would go into effect.
Cavanaugh said he was “thrilled” to know others agree with the merits of the homeowner savings account and hopes it’s a sign the idea will advance this session.
Spellerberg, the 35-year-old former mayor of Fremont, said inflation and higher interest rates have made the dream of homeownership “harder than it should be, especially for young families and young professionals.”
Housing is consistently discussed as a top concern and impediment to growth, he said.
 “As the state’s chief financial officer, I believe LB 938 will help more Nebraskans own a home and do it in a financially responsible way.”

Juneau over the downtown area Jan. 9, 2026. City officials issued an evacuation advisory Friday morning. (Photo by Claire Stremple/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s capital city advised downtown residents in avalanche zones to evacuate their homes late Friday morning. Avalanche risk mounted as a result of increased snowfall, higher temperatures and forecasted rain, triggering an emergency alert. 
City and Borough of Juneau Emergency Programs Manager Ryan O’Shaughnessy said the city is monitoring the risk closely and working with the National Weather Service and the state’s Department of Transportation.
“If you live in a slide path it’s time to grab your go bag and get out of your house and make other arrangements until the hazard has cleared,” he said at a news conference on Zoom that began late Friday morning.
O’Shaughnessy pointed residents to an interactive map of avalanche zones in downtown Juneau. Residents can type in their addresses to see if they are in a risk zone. He said the avalanche zone depicted in the maps includes what are called runout zones, where snow would spread after an avalanche.
 
Screenshot from the City and Borough of Juneau’s avalanche maps.
“This is not a decision that we made lightly,” O’Shaughnessy said of the evacuation advisory. “We’ve been monitoring the current conditions… and we’ve come to this decision to ultimately protect life and safety.”
The American Red Cross of Alaska has opened Centennial Hall as a shelter for displaced residents. O’Shaughnessy said the shelter will also accept people whose residences do not fall in the evacuation zone if they feel they are in danger. He said the evacuation notice could last several days depending on weather conditions.
Juneau has endured record breaking cold and snowfall this winter. NWS recorded 82 inches of snow at the Juneau airport in December and another 9 inches this month. The average for an entire winter season in Juneau is 87 inches of snow, NWS meteorologist Nicole Ferrin said.
NWS reported 3-7 inches of snow overnight on Thursday and a transition to moderate to heavy rain on Friday. Ferrin said the agency expects the heaviest rain on Friday afternoon and evening, which should taper on Saturday.
In addition to avalanche risk, there is a flood watch in effect in Juneau for localized flooding and ponding of water on roadways.

“If you’re not sure how deep the water is across a roadway or otherwise, or if you don’t know if your vehicle can make it through, then find an alternate route,” Ferrin said on Friday. “If your tailpipe is reaching the level of the water, then you could easily get stuck and cause more issues there.”
State transportation officials closed the only road to the Thane neighborhood at noon on Friday due to high avalanche risk in the Mt. Roberts slide zone. Capitol transit has limited bus service and is not servicing stops on Glacier Highway due to avalanche risk in that area.
The City and Borough of Juneau and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska issued a joint disaster declaration on Tuesday that was followed by a verbal state disaster declaration from Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
The news comes less than two weeks before the beginning of the legislative session in Juneau. The Capitol Building is not in an avalanche zone, but the governor closed all executive offices on Friday afternoon, according to Sante Lesh, the director of the state’s Legislative Affairs Agency.
Jeff Turner, a spokesperson for the Dunleavy administration, said state buildings are in “good shape,” but employees were asked to go home early on Friday at 1:00 p.m.
U.S. Coast Guard Sector Southeast Alaska has crews on standby to support Capital City Fire/Rescue and provide waterside transport in the event that it is needed to bypass high risk areas on the road system, Coast Guard Captain Stanley Fields said on Friday at a news conference with the city.
Juneau schools are closed Friday in anticipation of heavy snow and rain; the University of Alaska Southeast is operating remotely.
“This is a tough one,” O’Shaughnessy said at the Friday news conference. “This storm has impacted every aspect of all of our lives, both personally and professionally. I think everyone is tired. I know I’ve shoveled roofs and my driveway more times than I can count. But I want to stress that we are not out of the woods, and there are still significant hazards that remain for the public.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Opportunity Caucus said its bank statements offer “evidence for complete vindication” of allegations that Democratic state legislators broke the state’s law prohibiting elected officials from receiving gifts. 
Colorado Common Cause, a pro-democracy organization, filed complaints with the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission against members of the caucus alleging they accepted payment from a pro-business dark money group, One Main Street, for luxury resort expenses at an October gathering with lobbyists in Vail. The gathering was first reported by The Colorado Sun. 
Caucus leaders allegedly asked One Main Street to pay a $25,000 bill for legislators’ hotel expenses while at the Vail retreat. Email screenshots included in the complaints filed by Common Cause show One Main Street Executive Director Andrew Short asking for “an urgent, out-of-cycle approval for a $25,000 expenditure to secure hotel rooms for the Colorado Opportunity Caucus Summit.”

The complaints should be dismissed because the caucus had enough money on hand to cover all of its expenses from the Vail retreat before One Main Street made its donation, according to the response filed Thursday on behalf of Sen. Lindsey Daugherty of Arvada, who chairs the caucus. Daugherty said “the entire basis for the complaint is factually false” and encouraged Common Cause to dismiss the complaints. 
“The truth is that the Caucus could and did pay the hotel bill without using this (One Main Street) donation,” the response says. “In fact, the amount attributed to (One Main Street) as set forth in the complaint was donated to a local food bank and was never used for any Caucus purpose, let alone for the retreat. Therefore, because the causal link needed to prove an ethical violation is missing, this complaint must be dismissed.”
The response characterized the Vail trip as an “organization and educational retreat” for caucus members. 
Gift ban approved in 2006
Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, said the responses fail to address the emails from One Main Street leadership that led to Common Cause filing the complaints. 
“Nothing the Opportunity Caucus put forward in their filing or their press statements change the underlying facts of the case,” Belknap said. “We continue to have full confidence in the substance of our ethics complaints and we know that the Independent Ethics Commission has taken a close look and says our ethics complaints have merit.”
Recht Kornfeld PC filed responses on behalf of 15 legislators who face allegations. Sen. Kyle Mullica of Thornton opted not to be represented by the law firm representing other legislators, according to a spokesperson for the caucus. 
Other accused legislators include Rep. Tisha Mauro of Pueblo, Rep. Michael Carter of Aurora, Rep. Jacque Phillips of Thornton, Rep. Rebekah Stewart of Lakewood, Rep. Meghan Lukens of Steamboat Springs, Rep. Karen McCormick of Longmont, Rep. Cecelia Espenoza of Denver, Rep. Matthew Martinez of Monte Vista, Rep. Katie Stewart of Durango, Rep. Sean Camacho of Denver, Sen. William Lindstedt of Broomfield, Sen. Marc Snyder of Manitou Springs, Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet of Commerce City and Sen. Judy Amabile of Boulder. 
A complaint filed against former Rep. Shannon Bird of Westminster was dismissed because she did not attend the retreat in question. 
The Independent Ethics Commission moved the complaints forward in its review process in November. 
Colorado voters in 2006 approved a gift ban for elected officials. 
“Transparency is the point of the work that we do, and ethics enforcement only works if it’s done in the light of day,” Belknap said. “We believe in the system that Colorado voters and lawmakers created when we passed Amendment 41 to establish this gift ban.” 
Commissioners will review the responses filed by the legislators at its Jan. 20 meeting, and an investigation into the allegations will follow, according to Dino Ioannides, executive director of the commission.

Oct. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative bill introduced Friday would make the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission an elected office. Another bill would protect physicians who want to recommend the medicine.
Both bills, from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, come after a yearlong, continued fight to implement a medical cannabis system that voters approved in the 2024 general election. Voters legalized up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation.
Voters also created a regulatory, governor-appointed Medical Cannabis Commission with “exclusive” authority to regulate the drug. Under the law, three members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission automatically serve on the Medical Cannabis Commission.

Commissioners Robert “Bud” Synhorst of Lincoln and James Elworth of Nebraska City were appointed to the commission in November. Oct. 7, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Cavanaugh, a Democratic candidate for Congress in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, said making the commission an elected office would instill direct accountability to voters who have “clearly expressed their desire to have a well-regulated, functioning medical cannabis system.”
That’s a desire Cavanaugh said Gov. Jim Pillen and his appointees have “definitely frustrated.”
“The voters deserve to have more input,” Cavanaugh said. “I think it’s clear the voters want this, and this is giving an opportunity to have a board that is directly accountable to the people and will be more reflective.”
Legislative Bill 934 would require the five commissioners to be elected statewide beginning in 2028 for four-year terms. District lines would follow those of the five-member Public Service Commission. Two commissioners would run again in 2030 so future terms would be staggered. 
The commission would continue to operate as-is through Jan. 4, 2029.
Cavanaugh also introduced LB 933 with State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln. It would protect health care practitioners who recommend medical cannabis to patients from any criminal, civil and disciplinary action solely for recommending the medicine. 
The Omaha senator made a similar last-minute attempt to pass protections in May 2025, which procedurally fell flat. A more comprehensive legislative framework for medical cannabis, from State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, also failed to advance.
Many Nebraskans have said their in-state physicians have been unwilling to issue recommendations. The commission is writing regulations that would allow legal in-state sales.
Said Cavanaugh: “I’m trying to eliminate the fear of retribution from people like the attorney general who are specifically taking action to have a chilling effect on professional judgment.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN — A financial advisor who helped Lincoln businessman Aaron Marshbanks swindle $45 million from nearly 20 banks and savings and loans was ordered Friday to pay them more than $37 million in restitution.
While it’s doubtful that Jesse Hill, a Hickman financial advisor, will ever come close to paying off the financial institutions, the order gives a final rendering of how much money is still owed on fraudulent loans used to cover catastrophic investment losses and to purchase a villa in Costa Rica and a turboprop airplane.
This is what the Marshbanks mansion, now called “The Plainsman,” looked like in November as new owners began the work of completing the construction of the unfinished luxury home. (Screenshot from the Lancaster County Assessor’s Office website)
The scam, first reported by the Nebraska Examiner, has been described as possibly the largest case of bank fraud in Nebraska history.
Hill, officials have said, would accompany Marshbanks, a real estate investor, when making loan applications, providing falsified documents that showed plenty of collateral in investment accounts.
Hill was not present in the courtroom Friday when U.S. District Judge Susan Bazis issued her restitution order. He has already begun serving a five-year prison sentence.
Friday’s 10-minute hearing was in stark contrast to the October sentencing, when members of Hill’s evangelical church packed a large courtroom in the federal building in Lincoln in hopes that Hill would receive a more lenient prison sentence.
Only a handful of federal probation employees and FBI agents were present Friday when the restitution order was given. Hill’s wife, Tabitha, quietly watched the proceedings via a video connection.
The decision likely means that the Hill family’s luxury home and acreage near Hickman, valued at $1.2 million, will have to be sold to help satisfy the funds still owed to the victims after some assets were recovered.
News of the fraudulent loans became publicly known after Marshbanks, a former school board member and star athlete at Lincoln Christian High School, was found dead in his car in a downtown Lincoln parking garage in November 2022 after overdosing on several drugs.
Shortly after that, the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance went to court to block Hill from selling more investments and to freeze certain assets.

Federal prosecutors have said that all told, Marshbanks and Hill obtained $45 million in fraudulent loans from financial institutions in Nebraska and Iowa, of which $37.14 million is still owed after some assets were sold.
This summer, Hill, then 35, agreed to accept a plea deal, admitting to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in exchange for the dismissal of other federal charges.
At his sentencing hearing in October, Hill admitted that he didn’t “have the courage” to “challenge” Marshbanks as the scam continued.
An unfinished “barndominium’ (at right) and huge backyard pond are also part of the complex that was being built by Marshbanks (Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)
Marshbanks, according to Hill, began to deteriorate, evolving from a devout family man to someone who spent more time away from home, working out, mixing pain relievers with protein shakes and seeking more and more loans to cover what investigators termed catastrophic investment losses in 2022.
Some of the ill-gotten bank loans were used by Marshbanks to finance construction of a luxury home and barndominium on an acreage he purchased on the eastern edge of Lincoln.
As for Hill, Friday’s restitution order means he will likely have to sell a $1.2 million acreage and 3,000-square-foot home where his family lived near Hickman. Also ordered to be sold were the villa in Costa Rica and a multi-million-dollar Pilatus turboprop airplane he and Marshbanks co-owned.
According a U.S. Department of Justice website, such restitution is rarely paid fully, in part because such repayment to victims of crime can total millions and because the person ordered to pay often has no funds or ability to pay.
Hill had been working construction jobs prior to beginning his prison sentence last month.
Judge Bazis ordered that once Hill pay, once released from prison, $100 a month, or 5% of his gross wages, to pay off the restitution order. At $1,200 a year, it would take him more than 30,000 years to fully pay the restitution.
On a separate legal track, a receiver is still searching for available assets owned by the Marshbanks estate to pay back the banks.
One remaining question is whether a life insurance policy, in excess of $3 million, will go to reimburse the financial institutions or to Marshbanks’ widow and children. A trial in that case is expected this year.
Here’s what each bank is owed via the restitution order, per the judge:

Access Bank, $1.6 million
Columbus Bank and Trust, $2.7 million
Charter West Bank, $2.4 millon
First Nebraska Bank, $3.2 million
 Home Federal Savings and Loan, $2.9 million
I3 Bank, $2.7 million

Beau Ballard of Lincoln and Margo Juarez of Omaha meet on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. Jan. 9, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers are set to consider a slew of nationally relevant topics in the 2026 legislative session, including new bills addressing immigration enforcement, homeless encampments and artificial intelligence.
More than 100 new bills were introduced Thursday and Friday. That brings the total number of new bills, resolutions and constitutional amendments introduced over the first three days of a shorter, 60-day session to 250. Legislation can be introduced through the 10th legislative day: Jan. 21.
Immigration enforcement
State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha. (Courtesy of Nebraska Unicameral Information Office)
Legislative Bill 907 from State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, would prohibit law enforcement officers from entering “community safe spaces” to enforce immigration law. Such spaces include a range of public properties, including hospitals, schools, libraries, churches, shelters and courthouses. 
Juarez said she brought the bill because she is “appalled” that the Trump administration has allowed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to go “everywhere.” She said she views it as a violation that impacts both the people ICE is targeting and other members of the public visiting the same spaces. 
“I don’t like the creation of that precedent,” Juarez said. 
Juarez also introduced LB 906, which would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings, masks or disguises and require them to wear identification. State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha brought a similar bill — LB 854. Juarez said she didn’t talk to Hunt about the issue beforehand.  
Juarez’s bill is a bit more expansive than Hunt’s. It specifies that any evidence collected by an officer in violation of the new law would be inadmissible in court. She said there are legitimate safety reasons for officers to wear face coverings but argued it shouldn’t become the norm. 
“Bank robbers cover their faces, not law enforcement,” Juarez said.
Homeless encampments
State Sen. Bob Andersen of Omaha. (Courtesy of Unicameral Information Office)
LB 925, from State Sen. Bob Andersen of Omaha, would outlaw unauthorized encampments on any public property or right-of-way, unless the land is designated as a campsite or temporary site for an unsanctioned homeless encampment. State law already prohibits unauthorized encampments on state and county property, Andersen said.
The “Safe Parks and Public Spaces Act” came about, Andersen said, because of some residential area encampments where residents had seen unlawful behavior, such as drug use. 
“It is threatening and makes it unsafe for the resident,” Andersen said.
Violations of the new law would be a Class V misdemeanor, but, for first-time offenders, law enforcement would direct them to the nearest appropriate shelter for homeless individuals.

LB 939, from State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil, would require age verification for chatbots on online platforms and require online platforms to identify when chatbots use artificial intelligence and prevent such chatbots from impersonating a human while interacting with a minor. 
Chatbots are often operated by artificial intelligence software and apps, including X’s Grok, Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Murman said some of these services have been linked to youth suicides, and he hopes to mitigate those risks by increasing transparency. 
“I don’t want to overly regulate AI at all,” Murman said. “AI has a bright future.” 
Murman said LB 939 is similar to a previous bill he passed in 2024, LB 1092, which required online porn companies to verify users’ ages. As a result of the law, Pornhub went dark in Nebraska, where it remains to this day. 
It is unclear how an executive order President Donald Trump signed in December seeking to stop states from regulating artificial intelligence might impact LB 939. The order does include a carveout for protecting minors. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Other legislation
Among other notable bills introduced this week: 

LB 837, by State Sen. Mike Jacobson of North Platte — Allow cash transactions and wages in the state to be rounded up or down to the nearest nickel with the national elimination of pennies. Transactions ending in one, two, six or seven cents could be rounded down, while transactions ending in three, four, eight or nine to be rounded up. Digital payments, gift cards, checks and money orders would not be affected.
LB 843, by State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue — Require the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services to file a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program waiver for refugees and immigrants. 
LB 848, by State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, and LB 865, by State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln — Create three-day sales tax holidays before the start of fall school semesters. Cavanaugh’s LB 848 would begin at 12:01 a.m. the first Friday of August for clothing, school supplies, computer software, graphing calculators and personal computers up to certain dollar amounts. Prokop’s LB 865 would begin at 12:01 a.m. the last Friday of July for child care supplies, clothing, footwear and school supplies up to certain dollar amounts. The state sales tax is 5.5 cents per $1, most local rates are up to 2 cents.
LB 849, also by Cavanaugh — Exempt over-the-counter drugs from sales taxes.
LB 881, by State Sen. Dunixi Guereca of Omaha — Require law enforcement agencies, jails and the Nebraska State Patrol to receive approval from a “local governing body” before entering agreements to enforce immigration law. This follows controversies over Nebraska entering an agreement with the federal government over transferring the McCook Work Ethic Camp to ICE and local decisions by county sheriffs and county jails to help ICE. 
LB 910, by State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering — Require individuals convicted of sexual offenses against children to pay a fee for electronic devices seized during prosecution. 
LB 913, also by Hardin — Requie DHHS to appoint a dementia services coordinator who would serve as a central point to collect data on Alzheimer’s and dementia, evaluate needs and link families caring for individuals facing those diagnoses with resources.
LB 915, by State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City — Allow one additional Inland Port Authority district, for a total of six. The five current ones are in Omaha, Bellevue, South Sioux City, Lincoln County and Fremont/Dodge County. Districts require approval from a host city or county and are intended to help spur economic development.
LB 940, by State Sen. Dave Murman of Glenvil — Prohibit certain artificial color additives in meals served at public K-12 schools. The banned additives would include Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6.

The maternity ward at the Ouachita County Medical Center in Camden closed after hospital administrators concluded that keeping it open “was no longer feasible,” hospital CEO Glenda Harper said Friday afternoon. Harper said last year that the ward “does not make money at this point.”
The decision to close the ward exacerbates the challenges for patients and providers in a region where places to give birth were already scarce. Paramedics have seen an uptick in the number of deliveries being performed in ambulances.
Harper has been CEO of the hospital since August and hoped to keep the labor and delivery unit open despite it losing money every month, she said.
Arkansas’ maternity ward shortage sometimes leads to births in ambulances, paramedics say

However, the unit only delivered 119 babies last year, falling short of the goal of delivering 200 babies per year in order to justify keeping it open, Harper said. The hospital rarely exceeded 200 births per year since 2015, and it also struggled to retain obstetric nurses, she said.
The unit’s closure “reflects the immense challenge hospitals face when reimbursement rates from all payors do not keep pace with the rising costs of providing care,” the Arkansas Hospital Association said in a statement Friday.
The Ouachita County Medical Center closed its intensive care unit in late 2025 for similar reasons: low patient volume and difficulty staffing the department, Harper said.
The closest hospitals with labor and delivery units to Camden are in El Dorado, a roughly 40-minute drive, and Arkadelphia, roughly an hour’s drive.
Camden’s hospital is the seventh in Arkansas to close its labor and delivery unit since 2020. Among the other six is the hospital in Warren, an hour’s drive from Camden.
The closure leaves only 32 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties with labor and delivery units.
Amanda Warren-Newton, president of the Arkansas Ambulance Association and owner of Columbia County Ambulance Service, said she’s “working to elevate the competency” of paramedics to care for patients and their babies before and after birth because of the shortage of delivery units, she said. Columbia County borders Ouachita County to the southwest.
Republican Sen. Matt Stone of Camden said Friday that the Ouachita County Medical Center’s closed obstetric unit is a symptom of the ongoing struggles facing maternal health providers, especially in rural areas.
“I think that’s going to cause other problems with infant mortality and taking care of mothers and everything else, but they’re just trying to keep the doors open,” Stone said.
Arkansas consistently has among the highest rates of maternal and infant mortality nationwide, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
The Ouachita County Medical Center employed an obstetric physician who will be leaving the state now that the labor and delivery unit has closed, Harper said. She also said two obstetric nurses who worked in the closed unit have been transferred to the hospital’s emergency room.
“If obstetric patients present with urgent needs in the ER, there are people there who can take care of them,” Harper said. “What we’ll do is assess them, stabilize them, and then transfer if their condition warrants it, and if not, treat them and send them home, if it’s not obstetric needs. We will have the capability to monitor to see if they’re in labor and what the fetal heart rates are.”
Trading inpatient care for more federal money works for some, not all rural Arkansas hospitals

Most of the Camden hospital’s patients are admitted through its emergency room, Harper said. The hospital applied this week to become a rural emergency hospital, which would allow it to collect more federal funds in exchange for reducing or eliminating inpatient services and focus on emergency and outpatient treatment. It would be the sixth Arkansas hospital to assume this designation if the federal government approves the application.
Rural hospitals with 50 beds or fewer are eligible to apply for rural emergency hospital status. If accepted, they are subsequently licensed for zero inpatient beds.
Patients’ average stay at a rural emergency hospital over the course of a year must be no more than 24 hours, according to federal eligibility requirements. Delivering a baby via Cesarean section requires two or three days in a hospital for post-birth observation, so the Ouachita County Medical Center would have had to limit its obstetric services to low-risk patients only if the maternity ward had remained open, Harper said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ambulance-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 19:12:53.961487

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)FRANKFORT — A naturalized citizen from Louisville decided to run for the state House the night before the filing deadline, spurred by a Kentucky lawmaker’s proposal to bar immigrant citizens from holding local and state elected offices.
Suhas Kulkarni, who immigrated to the U.S. from India in 1986, told reporters that the legislation was “the straw that broke the camel’s back” before filing his paperwork at the Kentucky secretary of state’s office Friday. 
Kulkarni’s daughter, Rep. Nima Kulkarni, also a naturalized citizen and an immigration lawyer, has represented Louisville’s 40th House District since 2019 and is seeking reelection this year. She and her mother joined the elder Kulkarni as he officially threw his hat into the ring.
“I said, ‘Something’s got to be done about this.’ And then we talked about it and we said that our family has had the actual experience of the American Dream,” he said, adding that his family “struggled really hard” to build up a business, has paid taxes, served with community groups and more. 
“At the end of the day, if somebody says to me that after all of this, you’re not eligible to have some of the rights that citizens have, I don’t agree with it,” Kulkarni said. “So, I said this is not the time for me to sit on the sidelines.” 
The bills Kulkarni referred to, House Bill 186 and House Bill 259, were filed by Rep. Shane Baker, R-Somerset, in the first week of this year’s General Assembly. Baker told Kentucky Public Radio that his goal is to prevent those who have naturalized citizenship or dual citizenship from taking the state in an unspecified “direction.” 
Suhas Kulkarni said his family came to the U.S. seeking help for his older son who had learning disabilities. His son eventually attended The de Paul School in Louisville. He added that “we jumped from the lunch rooms of executive offices where I was working (in India) to sweeping the floor in a neighborhood grocery store.” He later bought the store and expanded an export business with it. 
In the 1990s, Kulkarni started an information technology business which later gained federal government contracts. 
When he turned 60, he felt that “there’s got to be something more in life,” so he turned to public service. He joined former Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer’s administration and founded the Office for Globalization, which is now called the Office for Immigrant Affairs.
Kulkarni said that there are “so many more benefits being a cohesive community as opposed to being an exclusive community” and he wants the next generation to have those benefits. 
“This is America — the land of opportunity, the land of possibilities, the land where people can come when people can work hard, achieve what they can do,” he said. “The American Dream — it’s not all economic, it’s social, it’s the mingling of cultures, it’s the strengthening of the gene pool.”
The incumbent Republican in the 48th House District is Rep. Ken Fleming, who is seeking reelection. Another Democratic candidate, Nathan Bellows, filed to run in the district last month. The district includes parts of Jefferson County.
Democrats and Republicans gear up for 2026
Ahead of the 4 p.m. deadline, Kentucky candidates vying for offices across the state were whisked through the secretary of state’s office Friday to put the final signatures on their paperwork.

Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said his office had received 437 net new filings since the filing period opened in November, including candidates for state and federal office. 
Adams said this year’s deadline day was “pretty slow.” Looking over the list of candidates, he said he noticed a lot of Republican primaries in Northern Kentucky this time around and his office had also seen “a real uptick” in Democrats filing for the state House this week. 
“I’m guessing KDP (the Kentucky Democratic Party) really worked it, or the caucus really worked it to get people to file for a lot of these seats that had been unopposed previously,” Adams said. 
Ahead of the filing deadline, House Democratic leaders were hopeful of growing their caucus this election cycle. During a press conference Thursday morning, House Democratic Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, said Democrats would have more contested races outside of Lexington and Louisville this year.
“You will see more contested races,” she said. “We will grow this caucus, and we will make sure that what stays at the center of who we are are the people.” 
KDP spokesperson Nat Turner told the Lantern in a statement Friday that the party was “thrilled to have more than 700 Democrats running for local offices all over Kentucky and nearly 100 running for seats in the General Assembly.”
“This excitement is a testament to the energy we are building around our common goal of reinforcing the American Dream, so Kentuckians in every county have good-paying jobs, access to quality health care and education and the opportunity to build a better life for their families,” she said. 
On the GOP side, Republicans remained confident that they will maintain their caucus numbers in the legislature. At present, Republicans have 80 seats to the Democrats’ 20 in the House, and 32 seats to the Democrats’ 6 in the Senate. 
In a press release after the deadline, Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, highlighted that eight members of his caucus are seeking reelection unopposed. 
“This is more than just a political milestone. It is a strong vote of confidence from Kentuckians in the direction our commonwealth is heading,” Stivers said. “That level of confidence reflects the strength of the conservative, responsible policies the Senate majority has championed for the past decade, which have delivered results and earned the trust of Kentuckians.” 
Sen. Max Wise, the Republican floor leader in the Senate, told reporters Friday morning that the caucus had been “very aggressive in fundraising to make sure that we’ve got our resources available for members who may have challenging opponents.” 
“We look forward to any challenges that come our way,” he said. We feel very strong with our supermajority of who we’ve got to be there to protect them, to hold their seats when it comes either May or November.” 
Who’s filed?
In the legislature, all seats in the Kentucky House of Representatives will be on the ballot, as well as about a third of Senate seats. Some lawmakers have announced they will not seek reelection in 2026, paving the way for candidates to run for a few open seats, while some incumbents will be challenged. More than 50 general elections in the legislature will be contested, according to filings as of Friday afternoon. 
In Louisville, three Democrats are challenging Democratic state Rep. Danield Grossberg. They are Jefferson County Public Schools teacher Cassie Lyles, former JCPS teacher and political adviser Max Morley and Mitra Subedi, who narrowly lost the 2024 primary to Grossberg by 50 votes before allegations of inappropriate behavior towards women last year against Grossberg were made public. Grossberg faced no opposing candidate in the 2024 general election. 
Democratic Rep. Adam Moore of the 45th House District in central Kentucky, is being challenged by a former Republican lawmaker, Killian Timoney, who was defeated in the 2024 primary. Moore won the election later that fall. Both had filed their election paperwork ahead of Friday. Jeffrey D. Thompson, a Republican, filed Wednesday. 
In the 93rd House District, Democratic Rep. Adrielle Camuel is being challenged by Hannah Rivera, a Republican who filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the Kentucky Community and Technical College System in 2024. Rivera had worked at KCTCS in several capacities over a decade, including as chief of staff. The lawsuit is still pending in Franklin Circuit Court, according to court records. 
Those that aren’t seeking reelection include Republicans Rep. Ryan Dotson of the 73rd House District, Rep. David Hale of the 74th House District, Sen. Jimmy Higdon of the 14th Senate District and Democratic Rep. Ashley Tackett Laferty of the 95th House District. Dotson is running in the GOP primary for the 6th Congressional District. 
Laferty is the last remaining Eastern Kentucky Democrat in the House at present. The race for her seat will be contested, as two Republicans, Willie Crase Jr. and Tanner Hesterberg, and a Democrat, former state Sen. Johnny Ray Turner, have filed for the seat. 
In judicial races, Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Chief Debra Lambert is up for reelection, and has filed to run again for the state’s high court. She faces no opponent. Lambert, who became Kentucky’s first female chief justice in 2025, represents the 3rd Judicial District, which includes parts of Central and Southeastern Kentucky. 
A seat on the Kentucky Court of Appeals is open after Supreme Court Justice Pamela Goodwine won election to the high court in 2024. The seat covers the 5th Appellate District in Central Kentucky. Those who have filed to run for the seat are Fayette County Circuit Judge Lucy Ferguson Van Meter and Judge Will Moynahan, who was appointed to fill Goodwine’s vacancy on the appellate court by Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Twelve Republicans and seven Democrats have filed to run for the seat currently held by longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell who announced last year that he would not seek reelection.
Kentucky’s six congressional seats are also on the ballot, and all incumbent U.S. representatives have filed for reelection with the exception of Republican Andy Barr, who is running for the open Senate seat.

Scams are costing the state’s event venues tens of thousands of dollars.

Picture this. You love the Indigo Girls. Imagine your excitement, then, when you discover they’re playing at your favorite local venue, The Flynn, in Burlington. You click the first link and go to purchase tickets, only to discover an exorbitant $250 price tag. You love the Indigo Girls, but you also need to pay your mortgage, so you pass. 
Then, you notice the website looks suspicious. It’s not The Flynn you’re buying from. It was a scam.
“Ladies and gentleman, that woman was me,” Susan Evans McClure, executive director of the Vermont Arts Council, told the House Commerce and Economic Development Committee Friday. “I realized that if I, the director of the Vermont Arts Council, didn’t realize I was being faked by a fake website, who else was being harmed by this?” 
McClure was there to testify on H.512, a bill that seeks to enhance consumer protections against predatory and scam ticket resellers. 
Though lawmakers still need to hash out the details of the legislation, it appears to have broad bipartisan support for some of its possible concepts, like a 10% cap on resell ticket markups, banning deceptive URLs and preventing sites from selling tickets that don’t yet exist. 
These practices that the bill would aim to guard against, though perhaps outlandish sounding, are already pervasive in Vermont, according to McClure and others. She pointed to the cost of tickets for UVM men’s soccer’s final game last season, which a reseller had posted online for almost 20-times face value. 
Kevin Sweeney, director of marketing and sales at The Flynn, told the committee his team has identified more than 50 websites reselling tickets from Vermont events, 20 of which have only cropped up in the last year. 
Scammers aren’t just costing consumers; they’re costing venues, according to Sweeney. Eventgoers frequently show up to The Flynn with tickets that were sold to multiple people by fraudulent vendors, he said. To preserve customer sentiment, The Flynn refunds the tickets, according to Sweeney, and he estimated that the fraud refunds and staff time cost the business about $50,000 annually. 
“We don’t have 50,000 to spend on that. That’s a full-time person we could bring in to do programming we really want to do,” he said. 
The bill currently exists only in short form, which means legislative attorneys need to work out the nitty-gritty. But the Vermont Attorney General’s Office endorsed the broad intent of the legislation Friday, and the committee looks poised to take it up in the weeks to come. 
In the meantime, be careful out there.

In the know
Senate Republicans declared their commitment to affordability and public safety at a press conference Friday, plus their concerns for Vermont’s dwindling revenue for roads and transportation.
It raises an interesting conundrum — how Republicans will juggle declining tax revenue, Vermonters’ desire for affordability and increasing needs in areas like infrastructure.
“We’re pretty firm: no new taxes, no new fees,” Senate Minority Leader Scott Beck, R-Caledonia, said. “But I think we also can’t be so bullheaded to say that we’re not willing to consider tax reform.”

Nearly our national bird
“The wild turkey has a special place in my heart as everybody knows,” Rep. Chris Pritchard, R-Pawlet, told the Vermont House Environment Committee while talking about the success of wild turkey restoration in West Pawlet. He said the birds were now in every town in the state of Vermont “for everybody to enjoy.”

A shrine appeared Friday memorializing the Capitol cafeteria’s lost microwave. Or Michael Wave, as one missive labeled the machine.
Flowers, a heartfelt ode, some amateur graphic design — the gravesite could move even the most cynical lobbyist to tears. If not tears of sadness, at least tears borne of hunger.
I do take issue with the microwave being labeled “comrade.” Inquisitive minds recognize the machine as a tool of capitalist ghouls, whose obsession with productivity has turned the midday meal into something to be scarfed down under expedited duress.

Today they merged their efforts.,"In summary
ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Common Sense Media had rival ballot initiatives designed to protect kids from chatbots. Today they merged their efforts.




Kids safety advocate Common Sense Media and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI joined together today to advance a ballot measure that would amend the California Constitution in order to protect kids from companion chatbots online.
The two previously planned to place competing initiatives before voters, each stipulating that the one that got the most “yes” votes would win. OpenAI’s proposal largely reflected existing law, while the Common Sense measure included new bans on what AI systems children could access.
The merged measure is known as the Parents & Kids Safe AI Act. It would, among other things:

Require chatbot developers use technology to estimate a user’s age range and apply filters and protective settings for  people with an age predicted under the age of 18
Require AI systems to undergo independent audits to identify child safety risks and report them to the California attorney general
Ban child-targeted advertising and the sale or sharing of kids’ data without a parent’s consent
Stop manipulation through emotional dependency by preventing AI systems from promoting isolation from family or friends, simulating romantic relationships with kids, or claiming that they’re sentient

 A Common Sense spokesperson said the measure was filed Thursday afternoon. It’s not yet visible on the attorney general’s website but you can read a copy obtained by CalMatters here. As described in a press release, the combined measure drops a ban on student smartphones in K-12 California schools and prohibition on minors using chatbots capable of engaging in erotic or sexually explicit talk that were part of Common Sense Media’s original initiative. 
The initiative must receive 546,651 signatures in order to come before voters in November. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber has until June 25 to determine if it reaches that threshold or qualifies for the ballot.
Common Sense put forward its original ballot initiative, the California Kids AI Safety Act, last fall, not long after the Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill the nonprofit had authored that contained similar provisions.
In response, in December 2025, OpenAI put forward a competing ballot measure that mirrors a bill that Newsom signed into law last October, requiring companion chatbot providers to enact a suicidal ideation protocol and inform people every three hours that they’re speaking with AI. Critics called that move manipulative and designed to thwart stronger protections for kids.
Common Sense Media research has found that seven in 10 teens have used companion chatbots and that the tech is too dangerous to be used by minors. In promoting its original ballot initiative, the group warned that without action the tech could lead to more harm and addiction for young people. In one well-publicized case, the parents of California teen Adam Raine sued OpenAI, alleging Raine was coached by OpenAI’s ChatGPT to commit suicide.
OpenAI’s willingness to compromise marks a contrast with how tech companies banded together to get their way in a policy fight in 2020. That year, major gig economy players like DoorDash, Instacart, Lyft, and Uber spent $200 million bankrolling a successful ballot initiative regulating gig work, Proposition 22. It effectively exempted them from a state law that would have required the companies to provide full employment benefits to their drivers.
Sen. Steve Padilla, the Chula Vista Democrat who carried the chatbot bill signed by Newsom, called the merged ballot measure a significant breakthrough. But he added that he thinks the matter should be handled by lawmakers and the governor instead of directly by voters. Since the ballot initiative would amend the state constitution, Padilla said it “would create an unnecessarily high-bar to revise and update that law in the future. Moreover, legislative hearings will provide the broader public an opportunity to comment and provide input on this important issue.” 
In recent weeks, Padilla has proposed a bill that requires age verification for chatbot use and a four-year moratorium on the sale of toys with companion chatbots inside. OpenAI signed a partnership with Barbie-maker Mattel but has yet to produce any products.
OpenAI’s fight at the California ballot box isn’t limited to kids’ online safety issues. One proposed ballot initiative would give a state commission the power to slow or stop AI model development if commission members suspect catastrophic risk of harm to Californians. Two other proposals target corporate conversions from nonprofit to for-profit companies, as OpenAI has planned. The initiatives compel nonprofits that restructure in such a way to dedicate all their assets to the public benefit of humanity. To reach that goal, the initiatives would create a commission that has the power to shut down AI models and that hosts competitions that invite the public to propose ways AI can help humanity. Under one of the initiatives, the commission would also have the power to revoke nonprofit conversions.
OpenAI was founded about a decade ago with a charter stating its purpose was to benefit humanity. Its plans to convert to a public benefit corporation led to heavy criticism from nonprofits and scrutiny by attorneys general in California and Delaware. Both states eventually reached agreements with OpenAI to allow a restructuring after the company agreed to place roughly 25% of its assets into a nonprofit.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/032123-Open-AI-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 18:58:20.155862

The state had been blocked from enforcing the policy since a 2018 federal court order found that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The order was in response to Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s request made in October to remove the block, citing a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited such broad-reaching bans. 
“For years, Idaho was blocked from enforcing common-sense policy and law requiring birth certificates to reflect biological sex recorded at birth,” Labrador said in a press release Friday. “Birth certificates aren’t symbolic documents that are subject to how an individual may feel, they’re legal records used in medicine, public health research, and identification. Idaho can now enforce our law protecting accurate vital records, while treating all Idahoans equally under the same amendment process.”
The nation’s high court ruled that federal judges can, in most cases, only place injunctions on laws that affect the plaintiffs in the case. In a court agreement filed Dec. 5, 2025, both sides of the case agreed that one of the transgender plaintiffs had already received their amended birth certificate and the other had chosen to remove themselves from the case. 
The lawsuit was filed in 2017 by attorneys from Lambda Legal on behalf of a transgender Idahoan woman and was later amended to add another trans woman from Idaho as plaintiff against officials from the Department of Health and Welfare and Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics. 
Peter Renn, senior counsel at Lambda Legal and one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email Friday that the change was in response to the Supreme Courts’ prior decision and “the fact that the original case wasn’t filed as a class action,” which a type of lawsuit brought on behalf an entire group of similarly situated people.  
“But nothing prevents a new case from being filed, and what hasn’t changed is that forcing transgender people to present birth certificates and driver’s licenses that out themselves as transgender when navigating everyday life is dangerous, archaic, and still very much unconstitutional,” Renn wrote. 
 “We anticipate that Lambda Legal may hear from Idahoans who are harmed by this development, especially because we understand that people born in Idaho may no longer be able to update the gender on their Idaho driver’s licenses to match their gender identity without access to birth certificates that reflect who they are.”

 Idaho previously had to pay over $300,000 over 2020 law that violated court order 

Despite the 2018 federal order that prohibited the state from automatically rejecting applications from transgender individuals to change the sex listed on their birth certificate, the Idaho Legislature in 2020 passed a law that limited ways birth certificates could be amended and prevented transgender individuals from changing their document. 
Later that year, a federal magistrate court again barred the state from automatically rejecting transgender Idahoans’ applications, and the court ordered the health agency to “institute a meaningful and constitutionally-sound process for accepting, reviewing, and considering applications from transgender individuals to amend the gender listed on their birth certificates,” Idaho Public Television reported.  
The court ordered that the state pay the transgender Idahoans who sued more than $300,000 for legal fees. 
Under Idaho’s law, to amend a birth certificate within one year of its issuance, Idahoans must provide a notarized affidavit declaring information was incorrectly recorded. After a year, corrections require a court action showing “fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.”

On Dec. 30, the three-person Torrance County Commission convened for a “special meeting” to extend an inter-governmental service agreement that enables ICE to house immigrant detainees at the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia. Before commissioners met, the contract had been defunct for two months.
The contract extension to March 31 of this year increased the monthly payment ICE makes to the county to roughly $2.4 million, funding the county then passes on to CoreCivic. The parties also backdated the contract to Nov. 1, 2025, the date the original contract expired.
NM DOJ says it is looking into Torrance County ICE detention contract extension

Immigrant legal advocates who have long called for ICE to cease housing detainees at the facility quickly raised questions about the validity of the contract extension and also whether the commission should have provided more notice to the public about the meeting between Christmas and New Year’s Day. 
The contract extension also got the attention of the New Mexico Department of Justice. Spokesperson Chelsea Pitvorec told Source New Mexico earlier this week that the meeting “raises real concern regarding backdating a contract, compliance with the New Mexico procurement code, and whether the Open Meetings Act was complied with.”
On Friday, the NMDOJ alerted county officials via a letter that based on additional investigation the department conducted, the county likely violated the Open Meetings Act by failing to provide proper public notice. One instance the letter cites is that the county placed an advertisement about the meeting in local newspaper Mountainair Dispatch one day before the meeting instead of the required 72 hours. 
50 NM immigrant detainees say mail issues at jail hurting their legal cases  

The letter also raises questions about whether the county could legally backdate a contract, noting that retroactive acts like that typically only occur when a public body is correcting an error. 
“The apparent retroactive extension of the County’s [agreement] with ICE is likely improper and invalid,” writes Blaine N. Moffatt, director of the NMDOJ’s Government Counsel and Accountability Bureau. 
The letter, addressed to County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach, asks the county to respond in a week with answers about how it publicly advertised the meeting and justified backdating the contract. 
County Commission Chair Ryan Schwebach told Source New Mexico on Friday in a brief phone interview that the county did not violate the Open Meetings Act. He said the Torrance County attorney was already at work on a letter in response to the NMDOJ.

In a statement, Chouteau County also aired some objections it had raised in the case and outlined the way the settlement could play out.
The county said the approved settlement notes if the U.S. Supreme Court decides only the U.S. Department of Justice can bring a lawsuit under the disputed section of the Voting Rights Act, the settlement is vacated.
In the case, the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation and two Native American voters had alleged the county’s at-large voting system unlawfully diluted the voting strength of Native voters, and last month, the U.S. District Court of Montana approved the settlement.
The case centered on a section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, which prohibits any “standard, practice, or procedure” that “results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.”
A violation of Section 2 occurs if a political process leading to an election is not equally open to participation by a minority in a jurisdiction, or the minority group has less opportunity to elect a representative of their choice than other voters.
Chouteau County sought to dismiss the case, but the judge ordered mediation.
The settlement means the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation has a chance to elect a representative of their choosing to the Chouteau County Board of Commissioners. It ensures the reservation is part of just one district in the county, and it provides for an election in the “single-member district,” where only district residents vote for their representative.
At the time of the settlement, County Attorney Stephen Gannon said Chouteau County was willing to work with the tribe and had done so in the past, especially to ensure voters were properly registered, for example.
Released this month, an additional statement from Chouteau County outlines how the case unfolded, offered criticisms of the tribe, and described how the elections would work going forward as a result of the settlement.
Approved Dec. 15, the settlement changed District 1 in the county to consist of only two precincts, and it makes District 1 a single-member district. The settlement said that means in the 2026 election, “anyone in Commissioner District 1, including a member of the Chippewa Cree Tribe,” could run for office.
“As many Chouteau County residents know, members of the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation do not pay taxes that fund Chouteau County’s government,” the statement said.
The Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation is 100% federal trust land, according to data from the Office of Public Instruction cited by the Montana Budget and Policy Center. Trust land is generally exempt from local property taxes.
Chouteau County Commissioners were unavailable for additional information in time for this story, according to legal counsel.
In response to the statement from Chouteau County, Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation said some claims require “clarification,” and noted “voting rights are not conditioned on property ownership or tax status.”
Chouteau County, though, argued that “despite not paying taxes, tribal members receive services from Chouteau County; however, Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation does not allow Chouteau County to provide services within the boundaries of the reservation.”
For example, the county said the tribe “refuses to share 911 information so the county can map addresses of its members.”
But issues related to taxation, emergency services or jurisdiction are “raised as a distraction,” the tribe said in a response provided by the Native American Rights Fund: “They were not the basis of the court’s decision and are unrelated to the right to fair representation.”
“The county is not allowed to silence the voices of any group of voters,” the tribe said. “That is what this settlement is about.”
Chairman Harlan Baker said equal rights was the point of the lawsuit.
“This case was always about equal access to the ballot and fair representation,” Baker said in a statement. “The settlement ensures that Native and non-Native voters alike have a meaningful voice in local government.”
Chouteau County said it settled despite some disagreement to avoid paying “potentially hundreds of thousands in fees.” In the settlement, each side paid its own fees.
The primary election for the new single member Commissioner District 1 will be June 2, 2026, same as the statewide primary, and the general election is scheduled for Nov. 3, 2026. Candidates may file from Feb. 17 through March 4.
In its statement, Chouteau County also talked about what happens if boundaries change in the future. It said the reservation currently overlaps Chouteau and Hill counties, and if the boundaries are modified so the reservation is located solely in Hill County, the settlement dissolves.
Also, in 2030, commissioner districts in Chouteau County will be reapportioned according to the census, Chouteau County said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3521-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-09 18:58:20.155862

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)A protest of approximately 20 people outside of a federal immigration detention center Friday afternoon on Albuquerque’s south side sparked several physical confrontations, resulted in the detention of two protestors and ended after federal officials threatened the crowd with arrest if they didn’t disperse.
Dare to Struggle New Mexico organized the protest outside of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in response to the fatal shooting by an ICE officer in Minnesota of 37-year-old Renee Good.
“We’re here to let them know we’re here, we’re angry, that we want to block and get crazy for them,” said one organizer Lizzie Nutig said through a megaphone in front of the gates. “We need to be loud, we need to be brave, we need to be doing things to block them.”
She continued. “We need them to know that people are mad.”
Using a megaphone, Nutig and organizer Brian McQuaid led chants including “Be like Renee and Get in the way;” “Fuera ICE;” “Smash the mass deportation machine;” along several others that contained profanities.
About five minutes into the protest, several demonstrators approached the gates outside of the facility and hung photos of the immigration agent who shot Good, and a photo of President Donald Trump with a hand-printed expletive. 
DHS officials, who had been watching the protests from the office, exited the building and shoved protestors away from the fence, and told them they were required stay on the sidewalk to protest. Officers also detained one person who Source NM has not yet been able to identify.
Additional agents wearing camouflage and Enforcement and Removal Operations patches filed outside, carrying non-lethal firearms and Saber Red pepper spray. No members of DHS identified themselves when asked by protestors or the news media. 
Protestors yelled, sometimes using expletives: “Do you like hurting people?” “Get out of here,” and “go to h-ll.”
Agents rushed at one of the protesters who yelled profanities, Adeo Herrick and, as protestors attempted to intervene, one of the agents in fatigues fired pepper spray hitting himself and at least one protester.
Herrick was then dragged to the ground and provided their name to Source NM while being carried away by multiple agents into the building. 
Shortly after 12:40 p.m., a car emblazoned with the Federal Protective Service pulled forward, blasting the loudspeaker message: “This is deemed an unlawful assembly,” ordering the protestors and media to disperse or face arrest.
When reached by phone after the protest, Nutig and McQuaid said they had not yet heard if charges were being filed against the two protestors detained and said they were in contact with attorneys. In a statement, they requested the release of the two detained protestors and the “arrest of the officers who assaulted protestors today.”
A request for comment to the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement remains pending. 
Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham earlier in the day released a statement calling for a “thorough and transparent investigation,” into Good’s death.
The governor’s statement also expressed her support for “those raising their voice in protest. Protest is fundamental to democracy — it’s how we make our government listen when something goes terribly wrong. But protests must remain peaceful.”
The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Friday’s protest.

Property rights issues center on the use of eminent domain for a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline. Demands to improve water quality take a couple of different approaches, including appropriated funding for a nitrate monitoring network and various land management strategies. This will the the third year that a bill related to pesticide labeling has appeared in the Iowa Statehouse.

Eminent domain and property rights
Debate around eminent domain and a proposed carbon sequestration pipeline have filled the halls of the Iowa State Capitol for the past four years and dominated the final days of the 2025 session, when lawmakers passed a bill restricting carbon sequestration pipelines’ abilities to build in certain areas.

The bill was ultimately vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds. Landowners and lawmakers, however, are already preparing for renewed policy and debate over the issue. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association noted in its 2026 legislative priorities that it will back “all efforts to lower (the) carbon intensity score of corn-based ethanol and promote ethanol as a carbon reduction solution across all markets while maintaining property rights.” 
The association, along with renewable fuel groups, have been supportive of the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would transport carbon dioxide from ethanol plants to an underground storage site and give the ethanol and corn industry access to low-carbon fuel markets. 
Leading up to session, Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh, R-Spillville, has said he plans to introduce legislation that would allow pipeline companies to route around landowners without the use of eminent domain.
Pesticide labeling 
Past bills, supported by the manufacturer of the common pesticide Roundup, would have ruled that pesticide labels issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency would be sufficient in satisfying a requirement to warn users of the product’s health and safety. 
Opponents argue these bills would give pesticide companies, like Bayer and beyond, immunity from lawsuits where users claim the product gave them cancer. 
A bill passed the Senate in the 2025 session, but was not picked up in the House. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association supported the bill in 2025 and said in its 2026 policy guide that it supports “regulating pesticide residues in consumer products in finished goods, not by restricting pesticide use as labeled during production.” 
Iowans told lawmakers to “do your job” at a rally organized by Food and Water Watch on Feb. 10, 2025 in the Iowa Capitol Rotunda. They were opposing a Senate bill relating to pesticide companies. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch).
The association’s president, Mark Mueller, said in a news release that policy priorities are shaped by policy surveys and roundtable discussions with members. 
“The issues outlined in this year’s priorities reflect issues that matter most to Iowa’s corn farmers, and with the start of the legislative session next week, we are excited to fight for these issues on behalf of Iowa’s corn growers,” Mueller said. 
A policy update from Iowa Soybean Association said the ag group anticipates a bill that will “provide consistency and clarity on pesticide labeling” and provide “consistent” labeling from state to state. 
Environmental groups opposed the bill in past sessions, alleging such protections to pesticide companies stripped Iowans of their right to sue pesticide companies for causing illnesses.
The EPA holds that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is unlikely to be a carcinogen, but opponents of the bill argue otherwise. The scientific journal that originally published a key study on the safety of the chemical, recently retracted the study, citing concerns around authorship and the validity of the research findings. 
Food & Water Watch, in its “blueprint” for clean water in Iowa, said the Legislature must “resist and oppose all efforts to protect corporate pesticide manufacturers through language granting pesticides immunity from liability.” 
Water quality 
Improving water quality in Iowa has been a priority for environmental groups in Iowa for years, but things like a lawn watering ban and a water quality report in central Iowa in 2025 elevated the issue for lawmakers and other groups. 
Notably, several groups have called on the Legislature to restore funding, at $600,000 annually to the Iowa Water Quality Information System, or IWQIS, which gives real-time measures of pH, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, and temperature in streams across the state. 
The network has been supported by the Walton Family Foundation since the Legislature diverted funds for the network in 2023, but the funding is set to run out this summer. 
Iowa Environmental Council listed restoration of state funding for the program as a 2026 priority. 
“A clear picture of how water moves through Iowa’s waterways — along with where pollution comes from and how water quality is changing — is essential for developing effective, evidence based solutions that protect our health and ecosystems,” the council said in its legislative priorities.
The group is also asking the Legislature to protect water quality by prohibiting the discharge of coal ash leachate, a byproduct of burning coal, into waterways. 
Food & Water Watch, a non-profit environmental group, called for the restoration of funding for the water monitoring system in its long list of priorities for clean water in Iowa. 
The group pointed to nitrate as the “primary pollutant of concern” in Iowa waterways. Food & Water Watch asked for an end to large animal feeding operations in “vulnerable” groundwater areas, tighter language around manure lagoons and manure application procedures and requirements that producers submit manure management plans to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and other policy recommendations.
“Iowa’s current policies fail to keep the public informed or to address pollution before it reaches people’s drinking water,” the blueprint reads. 
Iowa Corn Growers Association also noted conservation and water quality as top priorities for 2026. 
The association asked the Legislature to maintain funding for the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy — a state-led program to assess and reduce nutrient runoff into Iowa waters and the Mississippi River. The strategy promotes practices like cover crops, fine-tuned fertilizer application and reduced tillage, but it does not mandate nutrient reductions. 
Other priorities: 
Lawmakers have highlighted that lowering Iowa property taxes will be a key goal of the 2026 session and Iowa farm groups noted property tax policies were also a priority this year. 
Ag groups also spoke in favor of a comprehensive agriculture bill, not yet filed but proposed, by Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. The bill includes provisions for tax relief, expanded economic opportunities and enhanced biosecurity policies. 
Last year lawmakers considered several bills restricting food ingredients, including banning margarine from school lunches. Iowa Soybean Association noted that it would continue to advocate for the health attributes and safety of soy-based foods in the wake of similar bills.
Iowa Environmental Council additionally called on the Legislature to invest in programs and resources to reduce the prevalence of radon exposure in Iowa residences. Radon is a naturally occurring gas that has been linked to lung cancer. 
Lawmakers are scheduled to begin the 2026 legislative session on Jan. 12.

Due to cited safety concerns and inadequate staff training, United Counseling Service has until March to address the issues in its group living homes.

State officials gave a warning to United Counseling Service this December: Fix your longstanding problems, or risk losing your current ability to operate.
The state’s problem with the nonprofit provider’s service lines for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities include safety concerns that “put clients and staff at risk of harm” — things like failure to comply with housing inspections, high staff turnover and inadequate staff training and skills — according to the Vermont Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Now the Bennington-based agency must follow a corrective action plan and submit evidence to the department by March 2, to confirm that it has addressed the concerns. During this time, the agency is on a probationary status and unable to take new admissions of people seeking its services for intellectual disabilities.
United Counseling Service is one of the state’s 14 designated agencies — private, nonprofit organizations that the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living and the Vermont Department of Mental Health co-operatively contract with in each county to provide mental health care and human services, like care for those with intellectual disabilities and substance use disorders.
United Counseling Service sees 150 people with developmental disabilities. That includes medical care; different staffed, supervised, and group living arrangements; and transportation supports, among other services.
A key feature of the United Counseling Service’s support for those with developmental disabilities are the agency’s residential programs. The agency owns and operates three group living homes, with support professionals and a house manager in each residence full-time. The agency also facilitates “staffed living” for those with higher levels of need to receive more direct support in apartment-style residences, and it also coordinates shared living agreements for individuals to live in community members’ homes. Currently, the Bennington agency contracts with 28 shared living homes — 22 of which have been fully inspected and approved, the agency’s Director of Community Relations and Development, Heidi French, told VTDigger.
Care for six current clients is likely to be moved to another agency, she added, due to the safety concerns raised by the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living.
Separately, the agency also provides mental health services and substance use treatment. The mental health and substance use service lines remain unaffected by concerns from the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living, which specifically address care for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
To maintain designated status, an agency must meet criteria set and reviewed by the department. According to those at the department, United Counseling Service is not meeting the mark, and it hasn’t for quite some time.
In 2024, United Counseling Service’s status was knocked down to a provisional designation (“provisional designation without intent to de-designate”). Last month, it knocked that provisional status down one-degree further, to “provisional designation with intent to de-designate” (emphasis added).
If the agency loses its designation, it will no longer be able to receive state and federal funds from Medicaid for the care it provides those with intellectual disabilities, and the state would need to designate a different organization as the replacement. The department has 90 days following United Counseling Service’s March 2 submission of evidence to decide whether to begin the de-designation process. 
Other designated agencies have reached this point in the past, explained Vermont House Human Services Committee Chair Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, who was briefed on the issue. In those cases, the agency at issue has worked across the network of fellow agencies through Vermont Care Partners to share resources and regain full designation status. 
“It’s unfortunate because [United Counseling Service is] an organization that historically has been very strong. Sometimes this happens when you have a lot of turnover in key leadership, and they have had quite a bit of turnover in leadership positions,” Wood said.
In its more specific role in regulating residential facilities, the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living has also mandated that the agency bring its shared living homes in line with safety requirements earlier than the March 2 deadline or risk having the department withhold administrative costs for the homes that remain noncompliant.
“We have been and are continuing to do everything we can to ensure we come into compliance. This shift in designation indicates there’s a continued need to do that critical work in order to get back to full designation status,” French wrote in an email to VTDigger. 
She said that United Counseling Service is working on additional training and staff oversight and ensuring its shared living homes are inspected and compliant with safety standards.

Following up on a promise from earlier this week, the Republican-led Michigan House of Representatives has filed a lawsuit against 31 state governments departments and their heads in an effort to bar them from accessing $645 million in work project spending. 
In December, Republican members of the Michigan House Appropriations Committee voted along party lines to disapprove more than half a billion dollars of work projects funds, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers and multiple Republicans.
Following a request from Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, determined that the maneuver used to cut the funds process violated the separation of powers clause and other requirements in the Michigan Constitution.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While Democrats cheered Nessel’s determination, with Anthony calling it “a lifeline for the countless non-profit organizations and local governments that have been left in limbo for weeks,” Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and House Appropriations Committee Chair Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township) were quick to criticize Nessel’s opinion as partisan and flawed. 
“Our lawsuit will stop this Nessel power-trip and uphold the law that allows the Legislature to put an end to this nonsense,” Hall said in a statement Friday.

After five years of planning, the new software system is off to a rocky start. (Photo illustration/Rhode Island Department of Administration image)Some unionized state employees say the state’s new payroll system is not functioning properly and has led to error-ridden paychecks for multiple pay periods. 
Statements released Thursday from three different unions representing state employees hint at ongoing issues with the rollout of the shiny, modern and long-awaited system — including missing wages, incorrect pay, and problems with overtime, benefits, and deductions. 
The legacy payroll system went away for good in early December, its aging architecture swapped out for a new system anchored in the cloud-based software Workday. The payroll upgrade is but one aspect of the state’s Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) endeavor, which began implementation in 2023 and wrapped up last year, consolidating and modernizing the state’s payroll, human resources and other internal IT infrastructure. 
While Workday does not handle support or configuration for the state system — that’s the responsibility of a separate state vendor — the unions have directed some of their ire at the software.
Rhode Island Council 94, which represents about 4,500 state workers and claims to be the state’s largest public sector union, released a statement that said missing or incomplete pay, mistakes in holiday pay or overtime, and deductions not hitting investment accounts were among the numerous complaints received from members.
“Workday is not working,” Council 94 President Michael McDonald wrote.
Council 94 Executive Director Alexis Santoro said the state has worked to correct some complaints, but then the union receives more each day.
The Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers said in a separate statement that labor orgs representing “thousands” of public employees have heard member complaints for three consecutive pay periods. Like Council 94, the correctional officers’ union cited missing pay, underpayments, unpaid overtime and incorrect deductions.
“Correctional officers are doing one of the most dangerous jobs in state government,” Brotherhood President Richard Ferruccio said. “Violence is up, staffing is strained, and mandatory overtime is routine. Asking officers to shoulder those risks and then failing to pay them correctly, especially after three consecutive pay periods and right before the holidays, is completely unacceptable.”
Yet another statement came from SEIU Local 580, which represents frontline employees across eight state agencies. The same paycheck-related laments from other unions are contained in the SEIU news release, with the union’s President Matthew Gunnip claiming one documented case concerns “a member with nearly three decades of state service who is undergoing cancer treatment is now facing leave without pay because required documentation was not processed during the ERP transition.”
“When pay problems happen once, that’s a mistake,” Gunnip wrote. “When they happen repeatedly, that’s a breakdown. At this point, the risk and stress are being absorbed entirely by workers.”
“I’ve been in regular communication with the local unions representing state workers and they are very frustrated by the continued problems with state payroll,” Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and one of the state’s top labor leaders said over email Friday. “We are ready to work with the administration to address the ongoing concerns so the problems are addressed.”
Workers’ frustrations have coalesced into demands for a formal hearing before the General Assembly’s oversight committees. Council 94’s McDonald said in his statement that the legislature’s oversight committees need to “start scrutinizing” and “facilitate an independent review of what went wrong” with the payroll rollout.

“Oversight is absolutely needed!” Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat who serves as first vice chair on the House Committee on Oversight, said via text message Friday.
“How dare the state mess up at this time of year…or any time of year … on such a sensitive issue,” Casimiro wrote. “Some employees live paycheck to paycheck and may need to make a choice between heat or food…Will there be any accountability on this with the state employees overseeing this? We need answers … and our state employees need answers!”
The Department of Administration was responsible for the ERP rollout, and spokesperson Karen Greco said via email Friday that the state anticipated “adjustments” during the multi-year process to upgrade a system which she said covers more than 15,000 employees on payroll.
“The State is currently tracking about 1,700 open payroll-related tickets; we have closed almost 1,900 payroll-related tickets since the first checks were disbursed in early December,” Greco wrote, noting that some employees may have more than one ticket.
Greco said the state is prioritizing anyone who may have been underpaid, and “has made progress each week” by “issuing frequent off-cycle payments as issues get resolved to quickly provide any funds owed to employees.”
The department has cut off-cycle checks on six separate instances over the last month, Greco said.
An unsigned statement shared Friday by Workday noted that “modernizing decades of operations onto a single, unified platform is inherently complex — moving data and workflows from dozens of disconnected legacy systems, including manual and paper-based processes, into one modern system of record.” 
Workday said it was “working closely with the State and its deployment partner to support this transition, and are fully focused on ensuring accurate and timely pay.”
Workday, however, is just the bedrock of software on which the payroll rests, and is not the state vendor responsible for configuring the software. The state’s website and project materials note that Accenture — a global consulting and professional services firm with offices worldwide, including one in Boston — is the implementation partner for its new enterprise infrastructure.
Accenture did not respond to multiple requests for comment Friday.
Payroll wasn’t built in a day
Like any ERP project of considerable scale, Rhode Island’s modernization for its enterprise software was not a singular task, and strategic planning began as far back as 2019.

State purchasing documents for a 2024 solicitation related to the software planning noted that, at the time, “nearly all” of the Department of Administration’s internal processing was still manual in nature, with timesheets submitted in hard copy or as PDFs. 
The old system also ran on a mainframe and was based on the programming language COBOL, first released 66 years ago but revised many times over. Though practically ancient by coding standards, COBOL retains great utility and reliability in the colossal systems used by governments, banks and big businesses. According to IBM, it still powers 80% of  in-person credit card sales and 95% of ATM transactions. Still, many organizations are now migrating away from COBOL as its most veteran practitioners retire.
Hundreds of state workers still await merit raises. McKee’s cabinet heads don’t face the same delay.

During a March 2025 hearing at the State House, DOA Director Jonathan Womer outlined the herculean efforts the ERP entailed, even in tiny Rhode Island, with his department “going through 50-plus collective bargaining agreements and rules and regulations around payroll, primarily for employees.”
Womer also noted the importance of the project then: “We don’t have enough modern controls over our finances and financial transactions. We have been relying on typewriters and carbon papers for a long time.”
The state’s ERP website, which has been live since at least May 2024 per the “last updated” timestamps, includes numerous links, phone numbers, and information relating for state employees on the project.
The website noted that the changes would come in two phases: Certain internal finance operations would go live on July 1, 2025, while “human capital management” and payroll would come later in fall 2025.
The site also hosts a blog attributed to a mascot called Big Red, a Rhode Island Red chicken sporting blue-framed sunglasses that explains the ERP in lay terms across his blog posts.

“Currently, our HR, Payroll and Finance systems are lacking,” Big Red explains in one post. “We have siloed, outdated (downright archaic) systems, processes and tools that involve the use of paper forms and typewriters, minimal interaction between systems, and a gazillion custom reports all because we’ve got … siloed, outdated (did I mention they’re archaic) systems… well, you get the point.” 
In a post from August 2025, Big Red promised the state was “taking additional steps to guarantee system functionality for everyone.” 
“Remember when I said more testing – that includes enhanced payroll testing,” the post notes. “Money, money, moneyyy! We are running multiple parallel payroll tests to triple check the math.”
The chicken’s enthusiasm is not quite echoed in general discourse about ERP transitions, which are often regarded as intensive and high-risk projects.
A 2020 report from 18F, a digital services team working under the U.S. General Services Administration, warned that big governmental software projects have a low success rate, with only 13% of projects priced over $6 million seeing satisfactory completion on time and within budget. Success rates for projects under $1 million soared much higher to 57%.
“It’s counterintuitive, but spending more money on a project increases the chances of failure,” the report noted.
In 2025, Rhode Island’s enterprise planning project was priced at around $91.2 million.

But they urged caution when confronting federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam on Friday morning told reporters that the events of the previous night were being investigated by the local police and the Department of Homeland Security. As hundreds gathered in front of a federal building in Hartford Thursday night in a peaceful vigil spurred by the killing of Renee Good by an ICE officer in Minnesota, some protesters moved to the opposite side of the building where the confrontation occurred. 
“We will be investigating what appears to be a hit-and-run incident by the what we believe to be a federal employee, as we would any other hit-and-run in the city of Hartford,” Arulampalam said. The Hartford police will also be investigating the use of pepper spray as an assault, and the incident of an object being thrown at a vehicle as property destruction.
Asked if the people driving the vehicles involved in the altercation were ICE agents, he said that “it’s a strong suspicion.”
ICE did not respond to a request for information about the incident.
Protests during the second Trump administration have remained largely peaceful in Connecticut over the past year, as crowds, sometimes numbering in the thousands, took to the streets with handmade signs to hear speeches and exercise their First Amendment right to voice dissent. 
On Thursday, a few people with megaphones ran toward those gathered at the vigil. The sound of speeches was temporarily interrupted by urgent cries to come to the other side of the building.
Even as volunteers at the official event urged people not to leave the vigil, dozens went, some under the impression that they were attempting to stop a detainee from being taken away by ICE in vehicles that were leaving the building’s parking lot on the other side of the building. They gathered in the street. In the confrontation, a woman was pushed down by a vehicle, which rapidly reversed. Another person threw an object at a van, breaking a window. At least half a dozen people were sprayed with pepper spray by a man wearing a mask.
With the identities of the drivers of the vehicles and the person who deployed the pepper spray unknown, Arulampalam said the incidents are being treated as unsolved crimes.
He said DHS has indicated that they’re conducting an internal investigation. 
“They’re refusing to share any details with us until that completes itself,” he said. 
Arulampalam was one of several elected officials to offer a tempered reaction to Thursday’s events: he criticized the role of the Trump administration in escalating violence while warning Connecticut residents not to play into the caricature of violent protesters in American cities that’s being used to justify events like the killing of Good.
Arulampalam said that the violence that occurred on Thursday night “is a direct result of the lawlessness and recklessness of the Trump administration that has occurred over the past year and that last night came here to the city of Hartford, that resulted earlier this week in the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis. That chaos that we saw last night didn’t come from the city of Hartford.”
Arulampalam expressed pessimism that the federal government would be cooperating with local officials on the investigation, and said the lack of cooperation “stymies the efforts of local law enforcement,” to solve the case.
John Cappadona came to the vigil on Thursday evening and said he watched a man hurl expletives at police officers.
“In high school you would have said he’s picking a fight,” Cappadona said.
Cappadona was impressed by Hartford police, who impassively waited until the man walked away, and by peacekeepers who tried to keep people calm. He said he would encourage anyone put off by reports of pepper spray to come to the next protest and see for themselves: “you can expect that the police and peacekeeping people will do their best to ensure safety and it was very effective.”
Arulampalam said that police officers in Hartford are trained to deescalate in such situations. “Federal agents are sent in to enforce and don’t care about what happens in communities that they run through, don’t care about the aftermath of those actions. They have very different directives and visions of success,” Arulampalam said. “In general, we don’t want violence in this city. This is a city that is working to build a community that is an antidote to the chaos we are seeing at the federal level.” 
At a separate press conference on Friday morning, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., supported Arulampalam and the city of Hartford in its handling of the incident and investigation.
Blumenthal decried the shooting of Good by an ICE agent and said that the killing was part of a pattern of excessive use of force on the part of ICE agents that has repeated across the U.S., according to a December report he produced with other lawmakers on the excessive use of force by ICE and CBP. “The pattern of escalating indefensible violence must be investigated, restrained and reformed,” he said.
Gov. Ned Lamont spoke after Blumenthal and echoed his horror at the Good killing. Lamont also commented on the events in Hartford on Thursday night. “As usual 99% of the folks were there peacefully, stepping up and saying this is not right. There was an incident behind the courthouse as you heard the mayor describe and I just want to urge each and every one of you: Make sure you exercise your right to free speech, exercise your right to protest, but you do it peacefully. Don’t let Fox News take one isolated incident behind and say, ‘see it’s happening on both sides.’ It’s not.”
Lamont commended Connecticut police who are “taught not to put gasoline on the flames but to put out the flames and let people get about their lives peacefully.”
Asked more about the incident by reporters, Lamont said, “This is the issue: ICE took an open window and shot somebody in the head and shot her dead and she was an innocent mother of three. I don’t want anything to distract from that. You’re doing just what President Trump says if there’s a demonstration here in Hartford, a couple of people do something they shouldn’t do, that’s what distracts. He takes advantage of issues and distractions like that. Don’t let that happen.”
Blumenthal added that he has been to countless Indivisible rallies in recent months across the state, and “they have been uniformly, peaceful, orderly, well-conducted. That’s Connecticut. And, we’ll see from the video, and I’ve seen some videos of what happened last night, for almost everyone in front of the courthouse, the demonstration and the protest was peaceful and orderly. We’ll know more about what happened in back of the courthouse when those two vehicles sought to leave it, because for me at least it’s not clear yet and there needs to be an investigation.”
At the same time, Blumenthal encouraged people to dissent and get out to protest. Blumenthal said that peaceful protest is “an obligation.”
“When people use violence, they undermine their cause. They play into the hands of authoritarian dictators. And the history of the rise of authoritarianism involves the invoking of violence as a pretext for cracking down on lawful dissent. That’s what we need to avoid.”
National protest organizations like ICE Out for Good have instructed protesters across the country to be nonviolent, follow the law and “bring your most peaceful attitude even in these tense times.”
Activist leadership in Connecticut contacted by The Connecticut Mirror were reluctant to speak about the incident in its aftermath. Several declined to be interviewed, some citing ongoing confusion about just what had happened and how the events were sparked.
On X, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said he had spoken with Arulampalam and echoed Blumenthal’s sentiment. “My team and I will continue to gather details,” he said. “People are right to be furious, but it’s important for our protest to be peaceful. The intent of DHS’s inhumanity is to provoke a fight. Don’t let them win.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026_0109_SR_HartfordCityHallICE_056-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo courtesy of Nelson Thibault)At the Agent Orange Memorial wreath laying ceremony conducted in Sunset, Utah on Dec. 13, 2025, the flag of South Vietnam was prominently displayed opposite Old Glory. 
The placement of the yellow and red South Vietnamese flag at the ceremony was a symbolic gesture intended to send a meaningful message to Vietnamese-Americans living in the Beehive State.
The wreath laying event was an inaugural ceremony presided over by Larry Kerr, chairman of the Utah Agent Orange Veterans Foundation (UAOVF), at the site of the Agent Orange Memorial in Sunset Veterans Park.
On that momentous occasion, Larry wanted to recognize Vietnamese veterans who were U.S. allies during the Vietnam War. Those veterans were also exposed to Agent Orange and similar toxic herbicides.
Displaying the South Vietnamese flag at the wreath laying ceremony seemed like an appropriate way to express such a worthwhile message. So on the morning of the ceremony, Larry took the flag from his garage and brought it with him.
That particular flag has quite a notable history. Larry, a Vietnam veteran, brought the flag home from South Vietnam about 57 years earlier. The wreath laying ceremony afforded him a great opportunity to put it to good use.
After the flag was put on a short pole, it was set to the right of the U.S. flag. Each flag flanked the Agent Orange Memorial information stand, where a specially prepared wreath was laid.
A short distance beyond the stand, the partially completed monument towered high above the ground. Even without its panels and other attachments, the memorial is quite an imposing structure.
Larry plans to display the South Vietnamese flag at future UAOVF events. He feels that it will resonate with Utah’s Vietnamese-American community, because it represents something that was worth fighting for.
In the spring of 1975, that struggle to preserve freedom ended quite tragically with the fall of Saigon. And soon after, the displaying of a South Vietnamese national flag essentially came to an end as well.
At the wreath laying ceremony however, the yellow and red flag was displayed to pay tribute to South Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange exposure who struggled to preserve their freedom in an ill-fated and costly war.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Agent-Orange-wreath-horizontal-1024x585.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

The new contract was awarded on Jan. 1 and will cover a term of 10 years. As Belton Chalets held the previous contract, agency officials said in a press release that the public is not expected to experience any interruptions in service.
“Belton Chalets, Inc. has provided park visitors with exceptional and unique services at Granite Park and Sperry chalets for years,” Dave Roemer, Glacier Park superintendent, said in a statement. “We know that their passion for the chalets and their experience will serve the public and the park well.”
Granite Park Chalet and Sperry Chalet are two iconic backcountry lodges in Glacier, remnants of what used to be a system of nine Swiss-style chalets connected by trails built by the Great Northern Railroad.
The other chalets were destroyed by natural disasters or by park officials.
(Belton Chalet, a separate lodge outside of the park in West Glacier, is operated by a different concessioner.)
In 2017, a fire burning up the Sprague Creek Valley torched Sperry Chalet and gutted the 104-year-old dormitory. It was rebuilt over two years — a $12 million reconstruction effort that was supported by all three members of Montana’s then-congressional delegation, and former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, a native of nearby Whitefish, helping make it a national priority.
Belton Chalets, Inc has a long history stewarding the park’s backcountry chalets. The family-run company operated the chalets from 1954-1992, Granite Park Chalet from 1996-97, Sperry Chalet 1999-2004 and both chalets again since 2005, according to the NPS.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GranitePark_1.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

(Photo and seal courtesy of the Iowa Judicial Branch)The Iowa Supreme Court says Iowans who are given court-appointed attorneys should not have to pay legal fees if the criminal charges against them are dismissed.
Friday’s ruling by the court stems from a case involving Ronald Pagliai, who was facing criminal charges related to allegations of shoplifting when he requested and was granted a court-appointed attorney. Two of the charges were later dropped after Pagliai agreed to plead guilty in two separate cases. He later argued that he shouldn’t have to reimburse the state of the cost of his defense in the cases that were dropped by prosecutors.
As part of Pagliai’s plea deal, the state had agreed to dismiss the two charges with the understanding that Pagliai would pay the costs in the dismissed cases, which included $329.85 to reimburse the state’s indigent defense fund, plus $160 in filing fees.

Pagliai then challenged the district court’s authority to assess costs against a defendant for charges the court had agreed to dismiss.
In its ruling, the Iowa Supreme Court found that the district court had no statutory authority to dispose of the cases by ordering Pagliai to pay defense costs in dismissed cases. It then remanded the matter to district court, giving the state two options as to how the case can proceed: The state can vacate only the order assessing fees and costs to Pagliai, or it can vacate the entire plea bargain, the resulting convictions, the sentences, and the order for payment.
The justices noted that if the state opts to reinstate the charges that had been dismissed as part of a previously agreed-to plea deal, if can then file “any additional charges supported by the available evidence.”
The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa was among the public-interest groups that filed an amicus brief in the case, arguing that defendants shouldn’t foot the bill for legal fees when the state agrees to dismiss charges.
Alex Kornya, director of litigation for the Legal Aid Justice Center and cooperating attorney for the ACLU of Iowa in the case, said that while the court’s decision provides relief for Iowans moving forward, it also creates a dilemma for Iowans who may open themselves to additional charges by challenging the validity of their own court-ordered payments.
“That basic problem is that thousands of Iowans already, collectively, owe millions of dollars in cases, even though they were convicted of no crime,” he said. “It could present a difficult choice regarding the risk of the prosecution being able to refile charges. Realistically, that may prevent many people who have had debt assessed in the past from being able to take advantage of the court’s decision today.”

The Rebels star quarterback just finished his fifth year of college football in a 31-27 loss to Miami in the College Football Playoff semifinals on Thursday night.
He had planned to return to Ole Miss for one more year if the waiver was approved.
The NCAA said Ole Miss and Ferris State failed to provide adequate medical documentation to back up the request.
Ole Miss athletic director Keith Carter said his school will appeal the ruling.
“We are disappointed with today’s announcement by the NCAA and plan to appeal the decision to the Committee level,” Carter said in a social media post, in which he included the flag of Trinidad and Tobago. “Additionally, we will continue to work in conjunction with Trinidad’s representatives in other avenues of support.”
Tom Mars, who is an attorney for Chambliss, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the NCAA’s decision.
“The last time I checked, however, the only score that matters is the one at the end of the fourth quarter,” Mars said.

“I understand that Ole Miss will file an appeal with the NCAA. However, there’s now an opportunity to move this case to a level playing field where Trinidad’s rights will be determined by the Mississippi judiciary instead of some bureaucrats in Indianapolis who couldn’t care less about the law or doing the right thing,” Mars said. “Whether to pursue that course of action is a decision only Trinidad and his parents can make.”
After taking a redshirt his first season at Ferris State in 2021-22, Chambliss was held out in his second season for medical reasons. He played two more seasons at the Division II school, leading the Bulldogs to a national championship before transferring to Ole Miss before the start of this season. Ole Miss filed the waiver request with the NCAA in November.
Chambliss completed 294 of 445 passes (66.1%) for 3,937 yards with 22 touchdowns and three interceptions for Ole Miss (13-2), which set a school record for wins, including two after making the College Football Playoff for the first time. He ran for 527 yards and eight more TDs.
The NCAA said in its denial statement that approval of such waivers requires schools to submit medical documentation from a treating physician at the time of a student’s incapacitating injury or illness.
“The documents provided by Ole Miss and the student’s prior school include a physician’s note from a December 2022 visit, which stated the student-athlete was ‘doing very well’ since he was seen in August 2022,” the NCAA said. “Additionally, the student-athlete’s prior school indicated it had no documentation on medical treatment, injury reports or medical conditions involving the student-athlete during that time frame and cited ‘developmental needs and our team’s competitive circumstances’ as its reason the student-athlete did not play in the 2022-23 season.”
The NCAA noted that it initially provided a verbal denial on Dec. 8, which was 12 days before Ole Miss beat Tulane at home in the program’s first CFP game.
“To receive a clock extension, a student-athlete must have been denied two seasons of competition for reasons beyond the student’s or school’s control, and a ‘redshirt’ year can be used only once,” the statement reads. “One of the rules being cited publicly (Bylaw 12.6.4.2.2) is not the correct rule for the type of waiver requested by the school.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/08204555/AP26009092149854.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

The funds will be dispersed across Kansas to boost invasive species removal efforts, a Boy Scout habitat project, turkey ecology and toxicology research at Kansas State University, scholarships, sponsorships and a habitat specialist position. The funding is fueled by volunteers who raise money at banquets and fundraisers, according to a Tuesday news release.
Annie Farrell, the federation’s district biologist for Kansas and three other states, commended the volunteers.
“These volunteers are our boots on the ground, putting their hard-earned dollars back on the landscape to support critical projects that will greatly benefit the wild turkey,” she said. “Thanks to their dedication, it’s going to be a great year for conservation in Kansas.”
The wild turkey encompasses five subspecies, including the Eastern and the Rio Grande, which are found in Kansas along with a hybrid of the two subspecies. Wild turkey can be found in nearly every county in Kansas.
The Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks suspended the fall wild turkey hunting season in 2023 after years of restrictions.
Still, 13,862 turkeys were hunted and harvested in 2025, according to the department’s annual turkey harvest report.
In 2023, K-State received almost $2 million to conduct wild turkey research to deduce the root cause of the more than 40% decline since 2008.
Wild turkey populations were gravely diminished in the early 20th century because of human activity resulting in overhunting and habitat loss, according to the National Audubon Society.
The society’s annual Christmas Bird Count shows a steady increase in observations of wild turkey in Kansas beginning in the 1960s, when they were reintroduced into the state. Observations peaked in 2011 and have since declined to levels comparable to those of more than two decades ago.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/usfws-rio-grande-wild-turkey-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

Steny Hoyer's announcement that he will not seek reelection to the 5th District seat that he has held for the last 45 years is expected to make an already crowded race more crowded. Much more crowded.,"Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), then House majority leader, at a Maryland Democratic Party luncheon in Annapolis in 2020 -- when he was almost 40 years into his congressional tenure. (Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Rep. Steny Hoyer’s announcement that he will not seek reelection to the 5th District seat that he has held for the last 45 years is expected to make an already crowded race more crowded. Much more crowded.
“It will probably unleash a bit of a free-for-all among folks who see that open seat now and would like to have a shot at serving in Congress – knowing that it would probably, if they win, be a safe seat for them for as long as they want to hold onto it,” said Todd Eberly, a professor of political science and public policy at St. Mary’s College of Maryland, where Hoyer serves on the Board of Trustees.
Even before Hoyer bowed out, nine people had filed to run in the 5th District, a Southern Maryland district that includes parts of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and all of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties. As of Friday, there were five Democrats, two unaffiliated candidates and one Republican signed up for the seat, according to the state Board of Elections. A second Republican candidate who filed in April withdrew in October.
A number of notable elected officials may also get into the race. Prince George’s Democratic Dels. Adrian Boafo and Nicole Williams and Bowie Mayor Tim Adams have all been mentioned as possible candidates, should the seat come open, and there are likely others.
Besides getting more choices, 5th District voters — Democrats, at least — will also likely get a broader range of choices as Hoyer, a long a centrist Democrat, makes room for younger and probably more progressive candidates, experts say.
David Karol, an associate professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, College Park said Hoyer was a mainstream Democrat who wanted to remain appealing to centrists. But the district has changed, Karol said, with larger numbers of minority voters, as has Washington, where increased political polarization is driving candidates farther to the right and left.
“His positioning reflected the environment in which he came up politically, and that was the way it was into his 40s and even early 50s,” Karol said. “But I think that his successor is likely to be African American, and not likely to have centrist leanings.”
‘We must respect and love one another’: Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring

Hoyer’s colleague, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) agreed.
“He almost certainly is going to be replaced by somebody more progressive than he is,” Raskin said. “Steny is definitely more conservative than the center of gravity within the Democratic caucus now. I mean, he is the product of a different political generation.”
While Hoyer’s successor may be ideologically distinct, that candidate would do well to follow Hoyer’s model of community service, Raskin said.
“In fairness to Steny, I think that they will certainly try to emulate his record of being connected to the community, and committed to strong constituent service,” Raskin said.
Even though it’s Hoyer’s seat, leading Democrats in Congress may not try to tip the scales in favor of one candidate, because the seat is in a safe district, Karol said. In the 2024 election, there were 2.5 registered Democrats for every registered Republican in the district, according to a board of elections report.
“In some cases, the party establishment, such as it is, tries to consolidate around one person, but that often happens when it’s a competitive district and they’re trying to get the candidate who can beat the other side and hold the seat. That’s not really a concern here,” Karol said.
Two Democratic challengers from Anne Arundel County – Quincy Bareebe and Harry Jarin, both of whom have been running since October – released statements Thursday thanking Hoyer for his decades of service in Congress.
“Congressman Hoyer’s retirement marks the close of a historic chapter in Maryland’s public life,” said Bareebe, who runs a caregiving and assisted living businesses, and was one of three Hoyer challengers in 2024. “I am deeply thankful for his decades of commitment to our communities and for the example he has set for all who believe public service is about building a better future together.”
Jarin, 36, a volunteer firefighter, echoed those statements in an interview Thursday afternoon, crediting Hoyer for making a “very tough decision to pass the reins to a new generation.” But Jarin focused mostly on improvements needed in the Democratic Party as a whole, such as choosing candidates who don’t operate the same way as Hoyer.
“Our old way of doing politics, that is what created the conditions for a fascist movement to gain power in this country,” Jarin said. “The ideal that we would just try to hit the reset button and reset American politics back to the way we operated 10 or 20 years ago, frankly that’s insane. We need a very different path forward.”
‘There’s no one that doesn’t love Steny’; official Maryland reacts to Hoyer’s retirement

 
Among other potential contenders, Williams told Maryland Matters on Wednesday night that she’s giving “strong consideration” to a run, before thanking Hoyer for “all of his years of service to Prince George’s County, to the 5th Congressional District, to the state of Maryland and really to the nation. He is going to leave big shoes for us to fill.”
Boafo worked several years ago as Hoyer’s campaign manager, one of many current Democratic officials in the state who worked for Hoyer during his 60 years in elected office.
“I saw up close his distinct warmth toward everyone he encountered, his dedication to fighting for what’s right, and inimitable ability to assess the toughest challenges and win for the people,” Boafo said in a statement. “Maryland and this country is better because of Steny Hoyer’s service. May God bless his well-earned retirement.”
As for whom Hoyer might support to replace him, he’s not saying right now.
“I have some thoughts, but I’m not going to discuss them today,” he said. “We’ll see who’s running.
“There’s obviously going to be people who are thinking about running, who have been very close to me and have been very helpful to me through the years. I’ll take a look,” Hoyer said. “At some point in time, I may tell my friends and neighbors, i.e. their future constituents, who I think would be good to follow in my footsteps.”

Dec. 16, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceFollowing the Michigan Public Service Commission’s decision to sign off on a set of contracts for DTE Energy to supply 1.4 gigawatts of power to a data center in Saline Township, Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of environmental and consumer advocacy groups have each filed a petition asking regulators to rehear the case. 
During its Dec. 18 meeting, the public service commission granted DTE’s request for ex parte approval, allowing the contracts to move forward without intervention from outside organizations, which would be able to conduct legal discovery and file testimony on the contracts. 
Ahead of the meeting, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and the coalition, made up of the Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, advocated heavily for a contested case on the matter, arguing that it would allow intervenors to ensure that DTE customers are protected from concerns like increased energy rates due to heavy energy demand from the facility.
While the Commission approved both contracts, that approval hinges on several conditions, including requirements for DTE to update its tariff  structure for large-energy load customers, like data centers, and file an amended renewable energy plan to include a comparison of the resources it needs to meet the state’s requirement to provide 100% clean energy by 2040, both with and without the data center’s energy load.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The commission set a 30-day deadline for DTE to agree to the terms laid out in the Dec. 18 order.
In a statement released Friday, Nessel reiterated her disappointment in the commission’s decision to “fast-track DTE’s secret data center contracts without holding a contested case hearing,” criticizing the heavy redactions of the publicly available copies of the contracts.
“This was an irresponsible approach that cut corners and shut out the public and their advocates. Granting approval of these contracts ex parte serves only the interests of DTE and the billion-dollar businesses involved, like Oracle, OpenAI, and Related Companies, not the Michigan public the Commission is meant to protect,” Nessel said. 
Nessel’s petition for a rehearing challenges the commission’s authority to approve the contracts without a contested hearing. The petition also raises questions on how the conditions set by the commission would prevent DTE from passing along costs to serve the data center, which is under development by tech giant Oracle and data center developer Related Digital for use by ChatGPT-creator OpenAI. 
Matt Helms, the commission’s spokesperson, said in a statement that the body looks forward to considering Nessel’s petition for a rehearing, but denied any claims that they had not sufficiently reviewed the contracts. 
The commission’s staff thoroughly reviewed unredacted contracts to ensure customers are protected, Helms said.
“The Commission’s order in this case recognizes the utility’s obligation to serve this customer under Michigan law while requiring the strongest consumer protections for a data center power contract in the country – protections that would not be available under existing tariffs without the Commission’s approval of these contracts,” Helms said. 
Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan raised their own questions on how the conditions laid out by the commission would protect customers from increased energy rates, alongside other concerns, like how the conditions on the contracts will be enforced.
In a statement to the Michigan Advance, DTE spokesperson Ryan Lowry argued that the contracts protect their customers from subsidizing the data center’s energy rate. The company will continue to follow the regulatory process, Lowry said.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire state lawmakers passed two bills related to abortion this week: one to ensure that a health care provider who conscientiously objects to abortion can keep their job if they refuse to aid in an abortion, and another that criminalizes driving a minor to an abortion appointment.
House Bill 232, which was passed by the House Thursday, would enshrine into law the right for a provider to conscientiously object to participating in an abortion. It would empower any provider who is discriminated against by their employer for not participating in an abortion to sue for damages. And it would require employers to place an 8½-by-11-inch poster in the workplace entitled “Freedom of Conscience for Health Care Providers” that outlines employees’ rights not to participate in abortions. The law would not apply to employees of health care institutions that provide abortion as a major part of its services or employees who are the only health care provider present in an emergency situation.
Abortion has been legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy in New Hampshire since 2021. Republican leaders, who control the state House and Senate, and governor’s office, promised on the campaign trail they would not expand that restriction. Gov. Kelly Ayotte, in her inaugural address in 2025, promised to veto any legislation to further restrict abortion.
On the House floor Thursday, Katy Peternel, a Wolfeboro Republican and co-sponsor of the bill, argued the legislation wasn’t an abortion restriction, but rather simply a measure to “protect health care professionals from being forced to participate in the ending of a human life.” She said the bill is important to “(allow) New Hampshire to attract providers who value motherhood and family.”
Peternel argued that “for many health care providers, abortion represents the deliberate taking of human life, an unnatural violent separation of unborn children from their mother. … No one should have to choose between their profession and moral integrity.”
Peternel has long been a vocal proponent of strengthening abortion restrictions. In early 2025, she unsuccessfully attempted to ban abortions after 15 weeks. She backed away and withdrew that bill before it was given a floor vote.
“This bill does not ban or restrict access to abortion,” Peternel said Thursday about HB 232. “It simply brings New Hampshire in line with 47 other states with conscience clauses.”
Democrats didn’t buy that argument.
“Make no mistake about it,” Rep. Zoe Manos, a Stratham Democrat, said. “This is an anti-abortion bill.”
Manos argued that while Republicans claim the bill is about “a health care provider’s right of conscience,” it is actually an effort to allow “someone to turn a patient away from accessing abortion.” She alleged that the bill would allow anyone working in a facility, even a receptionist, to refuse to participate in an abortion. “Should a receptionist have the power to deny health care to patients in New Hampshire?” she asked.
The House voted, 184-164, to approve the bill. All but six Republicans voted for it, while all but one Democrat voted against it. The bill will now be considered by the Senate. If the Senate follows suit, the bill will go to the governor’s desk for final approval.
Meanwhile, the Senate also approved an abortion-related bill on Wednesday. House Bill 191 seeks to make helping a minor travel to receive an abortion — or any other procedure — without parental permission illegal.
The bill has already passed the House. In its original form, the legislation was focused entirely on abortion. However, it was subsequently amended in the House to outlaw transporting a minor for any procedure. First offenses of this bill would result in a misdemeanor and a third offense would be a felony. In March, the bill was passed by the House, 180-164, with the broader language.
Wednesday’s bill similarly fell upon party lines during debate.
Sen. Tara Reardon, a Concord Democrat, called the bill “duplicative,” noting that state law already requires parental consent for a child to receive an abortion. She also argued the bill — having been expanded to all surgical procedures — could criminalize transporting children to doctor’s appointments as routine as the removal of wisdom teeth. 
“If I ask my neighbor, my sister, my mother to take my son to the dentist, is that explicit or implicit consent?” Reardon said. “It’s debatable. It’s a gamble. And a criminal misdemeanor is the price for that.”
She called it “draconian, punitive, and unnecessary when the Legislature has previously crafted a solution to this issue.”
The Senate voted, 16-8, along party lines to approve the bill. Before passing it, the Senate amended the bill. Senators changed the bill text from “a surgical procedure for the minor” to “a surgical procedure for the minor or a termination of the minor’s pregnancy.” They also removed a requirement the House implemented for notarized consent, changing it to simply written consent. The bill will now return to the House for the amendment to be considered.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/statehousesnow-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-09 17:58:34.538092

She moved to the city with her wife and 6-year-old son almost a year ago.
Good’s wife, Rebecca Good, told the Washington Post that they had stopped to support neighbors when she was shot by the ICE agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross by the Star Tribune. 
“On Wednesday, January 7th, we stopped to support our neighbors. We had whistles. They had guns,” Rebecca Good said in a statement to the Post and other media outlets on Friday.
“We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness,” the statement continues. “Renee lived this belief every day. She is pure love. She is pure joy. She is pure sunshine.”
Renee Good, 37, was a mother to a 15-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 12 and 6, her first husband told the Post. Online records and interviews with media outlets from family and friends paint her as a caring person and an avid writer who enjoyed movies, making art, singing and playing guitar. Her first husband described her as a devoted Christian to the Post.
She studied creative writing at Old Virginia University in Norfolk, Va., graduating in December 2020. She won an undergraduate poetry prize in 2020 for her poem “On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs,” which the contest judge described as “a meditation that leads the reader into the unknown.”
“May Renee’s life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,” university president Brian O. Hemphill said in a statement. “My hope is for compassion, healing, and reflection at a time that is becoming one of the darkest and most uncertain periods in our nation’s history.”
She was originally from Colorado Springs, Colo. She lived in Kansas City, Mo., with her wife before moving to Minnesota. Their former neighbor in Kansas City told the Post that the couple said they wanted to move out of the red state after President Donald Trump was elected in 2024.
Her second husband, Tim Macklin, died in 2023 and was a military veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, reported the Post. He was also a comedian with whom she co-hosted a podcast, according to a post on the Old Virginia University English department Facebook page.
A faculty member who taught her, Kent Wascom, described her to the Post as a poet who was focused on improving her fiction writing and who, unlike peers, never talked about politics.
“She was kind and talented, a working class mom who put herself through school despite circumstances that would’ve crumpled the pathetic rich boy politicians who sadistically abetted her murder,” Wascom said in an X post.
Good described herself as a “poet and writer and wife and mom and sh*tty guitar strummer from Colorado” who is “experiencing Minneapolis” on what appears to be her now-private Instagram page.

The Office of Childhood in the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which found it could not access the funds earlier this week, had been unable to explain the delay to child care providers because it had not received communication from the federal government before Thursday evening.
“We know how important these payments are to providers, and this is our utmost priority,” said Office of Childhood Assistant Commissioner Deidre Anderson-Barbee in the press release.
The department submitted a “comprehensive breakdown” Friday morning to meet the requirements of a federal initiative called “Defend the Spend,” its spokesman told The Independent. Defend the Spend, a system created by the now-dissolved Department of Government Efficiency, requires recipients of federal funds to justify each transaction before they can receive payment.
Although the state office has submitted the required documentation, child care providers still don’t know when they can expect to receive payment. 
Missouri waiting on $25.7 million payment from feds to reimburse child care providers

Lisa Scheer, director of Baden Christian Child Care in St. Louis, told The Independent that the message from the state office brings little relief.
“It’s an answer, but it’s not an answer anyone wants to hear,” Scheer said. “To be honest, there’s not going to be an answer until they say, ‘We’re paying you.”
Scheer said her child care center relies heavily on the federal funds because each of the 45 children the center serves participates in the subsidy program. Families in Missouri must earn no more than 150% of the federal poverty level to qualify.
“Our families really rely on our services for food, for safety,” Scheer said. “We provide area transportation and really just a safe haven for our neighborhood and community.”
U.S. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill on Dec. 30 announced in a social media post that all states would be required to justify their child care expenses in order to access support from the federal Child Care and Development Fund.
On Monday the federal department froze child care payments to five states — all with Democrat-led governments.
The state’s Office of Childhood said Friday that the federal request for information about Missouri’s child care subsidy program indicates “Missouri child care funds have not been frozen.”
Before that communication, the cause of the delay wasn’t clear. 
Casey Hanson, deputy director of Kids Win Missouri, told The Independent that the uncertainty has made the funding disruption more painful for child care providers who operate on very tight margins.
In a meeting of around 160 providers Wednesday, Hanson said, many were “frustrated and upset.”
Some providers who mostly serve families who receive subsidies “are at a point to be turning [those families] away, especially if they don’t have reserves, and a lot of small providers really don’t,” Hanson said.
Scheer, who was in the meeting, said she’s trying to delay costs where she can. She agreed with her husband that she won’t draw a paycheck until federal funding comes through.  But she realizes her employees, who are mostly single women, can’t do that.
While Scheer said she is committed to keeping her doors open, she’s not sure how long the center would be able to operate without subsidy payments.
“It’s trying to make sure my employees’ needs are met so that they can still show up for children, so children’s needs are met, so that parents can still go to work and be parents for their children,” Scheer said.
“It’s just a lot of unknown.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8677-1024x615.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 17:12:39.732563

(Photo courtesy DWS)Homeless shelters across the state received funding to keep people warm amid a statewide cold snap thanks to a first-ever, state-funded grant program from the new Office of Housing. 
The statewide Office of Housing emerged as one of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s priorities during the legislative session last year. The small team within the state’s Department of Workforce Solutions is tasked with overseeing the allocation of more than $100 million on a statewide strategy for affordable housing and homelessness prevention measures, including about $20 million the Legislature approved specifically for “anti-homelessness initiatives.”
That’s the fund where the office found $820,000 to provide to several dozen statewide facilities, including transitional living centers, domestic violence shelters and others, to increase their capacity and warmth this winter, DWS Secretary Sarita Nair told Source New Mexico on Friday. 
Individual shelters typically rely on local governments or private contributions to keep unhoused people warm during the winter months. And they often come up short funding-wise, according to a survey of housing nonprofit organizations the Office of Housing conducted shortly after launching last year, Nair said.

“This hasn’t been a role that the state’s played historically,” Nair said of funding the warming centers. “But it has always been a challenge for a lot of these shelters to be able to expand for the additional demand they see in the winter.”
Shelters that applied for the funding received up to $20,000 grants they could use on supplies like cots, portable heaters or blankets and generally to increase the number of people they’re able keep warm during the winter. 
“We heard from some folks that, ‘This is the first time that we’ve been able to heat every room in our shelter,’” Nair said. “Really basic things, but that’s how you expand the capacity.”
A news release from the office said the funding has already proven particularly useful in rural areas, where “providers reported improved building heating, increased street outreach efforts, expanded bed capacity, and the ability to offer extended overnight hours with hot meals.” 
Nair also said the Office of Housing is already preparing to execute a similar grant funding round to help shelters keep unhoused people from overheating during the summer months. 
“We know that cooling centers are becoming equally important,” she said. “And so we would love to do another round of that, if we get more funding.”

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, says the president does not have the authority to unilaterally freeze funding approved by Congress for the states. It marks Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s 50th legal challenge to Trump administration policies. 
“The people who will be affected today are people who are struggling to make ends meet — parents whose child care assistance is now being threatened so that they face impossible decisions,” Weiser said in a press call Friday.
Other attorneys general on the call included Rob Bonta of California, Letitia James of New York, Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Kwame Raoul of Illinois.
The administration’s targeting of the five states is “pure partisan politics,” Bonta said. James said the administration froze the funding based on unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.
“This unlawful funding freeze is about one thing: Punishing Democratic states that oppose the president,” James said. 
The lawsuit asks the court to declare the freeze unconstitutional and stop the federal government from implementing it.
“We believe that if we can’t persuade the Trump administration to do what is right and to follow the law, we believe the courts will give relief to the people who need it so desperately,” Ellison said. “One thing is abundantly clear: Donald Trump wants to use the mechanism of government to punish people and states that he doesn’t like.”
The administration’s move to freeze funding based on suspicion of fraud is not based on the results of any investigations, Ellison said, and the president has not looked at ways the states have held people accountable for trying to defraud the affected programs. 
Minnesota has experienced widespread fraud cases involving misuse of government funds for safety-net programs.
Raoul said the funding freeze has nothing to do with fraud and that his office “regularly works to investigate and prosecute individuals who defraud Illinois taxpayers.” 
“If the President was serious about rooting out fraud, his administration would be investing more resources in partnering with states and supporting states’ efforts to root out fraud and abuse,” Raoul said. 
Colorado receives about $136 million in block funding for TANF, administered through Colorado Works, every year. In 2024, a Colorado family of three received a maximum monthly TANF benefit of $585, according to the National Center for Children in Poverty. Last year, the state was allocated about $140 million in federal funds to pay for care for children in low-income families, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen) talks with people testifying during the Senate budget and appropriations committee, which he chairs, on Jan. 9, 2026, at the Statehouse in Trenton. (Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Two New Jersey legislative panels pushed through over $128 million in proposed new spending Thursday night without explanation or public comment, prompting outcry from good government advocates who warned that such secrecy erodes the public’s trust.
Details of the new spending were posted online Friday midday, long after the Senate’s budget and appropriations committee approved it in the last two minutes of a six-hour hearing at Trenton’s Statehouse. The vote on the bill came after most spectators — and even some committee members — had left for the night.
The Assembly’s appropriations committee also approved the bill Thursday, long after nightfall near the end of its eight-hour meeting.
The bill verbiage offers brief, vague descriptions of 18 items of proposed spending. They include funding for a state supercomputer, World Cup promotions, and capital improvements at county buildings, schools, and a hospital.

Peter Chen, a senior analyst with progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective, was at the Senate hearing and stood to question the spending, but Sen. Paul Sarlo, the committee’s chair, called for a vote without allowing public comment.
“This is, unfortunately, part of a pattern of a lack of transparency around the budget and around how the state spends the public’s funds,” Chen said Friday. “Each of these programs might be a good idea, but I certainly have questions about $25 million for a supercomputer and a sort of blanket dollar amount for World Cup preparations. I think the public should have a right to ask questions about and see details on these kinds of proposals before they’re voted on.”
Sarlo, before the vote, described the budget bill as supplemental appropriations that were a mix of spending legislators approved in recent weeks, spending that Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration requested, and “let’s call it repairs or corrections that were made as part of the budget process.”
Stella Porter, a Murphy spokeswoman, declined to comment.
In both committees, the Democrats supported the bill, while Republicans voted against it. The bill was sponsored by Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) and Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin (D-Essex), the lower chamber’s Democratic budget officer.
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) voted against the bill. He told the New Jersey Monitor Friday that both the process and the extra spending are “nuts.”
“There’s no reason to add $128 million in spending — ever, quite frankly, during the course of the year. It’s just all political giveaways. What about the other 500 good causes out there? Why these 18?” O’Scanlon said. “We’ve been hearing about the looming Medicaid cuts that we’re going to have to deal with. Why isn’t this money going to that, if we have it? It’s ridiculous.”
The proposed new spending includes:

$38 million in capital improvements at the Bergen New Bridge Medical Center in Paramus ($12 million); the Hudson County Schools of Technology ($10 million); Kean University ($5 million); the Mercer County Connection building in Hamilton ($2 million); and unspecified capital improvements in Union County ($9 million).
$26 million to the state Economic Development Authority for events marketing, $20 million of which will go to the 2026 FIFA World Cup Host Committee to promote statewide tourism. First lady Tammy Murphy is chair of the committee’s board of directors.
$25 million for an “AI Supercomputer Initiative,” in which a university would host “a new state-of-the-art supercomputer.”
$15 million for a new regional county jail in Camden County ($13 million) and for emergency vehicles and communications upgrades in Gloucester and Salem counties ($2 million).
$10 million in unspecified counties “to achieve efficiencies and future cost savings in the provision of services at the local level.”
$5 million for the state Office of the Food Security Advocate to research food insecurity and fund grants and partnerships to reduce hunger.
$4 million for the Middlesex County Network Operations Center.
$2 million for homelessness services in Burlington County.
$1.5 million for the Old Barracks Museum in Trenton.
$1 million to fund transportation for special-needs adults for the Larc Norcross School in Bellmawr.

The new spending comes six months after New Jersey lawmakers approved a record-high $58.8 billion budget that included a number of cuts and controversial diversions that have spurred ongoing protests and calls for restored funding. That budget also included over $700 million for lawmakers’ pet projects that critics have condemned as pork spending, even though Murphy had warned federal cuts and other budget stressors would require “hard decisions.”
O’Scanlon, as the Senate Republicans’ budget officer, has long railed against Legislature’s budget process, in which lawmakers are asked to vote on a lengthy annual budget at the end of June, just hours after they first see it. The criticism is not just partisan, with advocates long calling for more transparency too.
Thursday’s spending bill was just one of many added at the last-minute to both committees’ agendas, which O’Scanlon also blasted as an “irresponsible” failure of transparency.
“Taxpayers deserve far better than this broken process,” he said.

The bill will be up for a vote before both full chambers Monday, the final voting sessions of the current legislative session. Murphy then must sign it for it to become law. His last day as governor is Jan. 20.

Polk, Woodbury, Muscatine and other Iowa counties have been sued by numerous jail inmates in recent months, each alleging they’ve been unlawfully detained in county jails by ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
An exact count of all the lawsuits against Iowa jails is difficult to calculate given the fact that Iowa’s county jails typically don’t disclose the names of inmates who are being held at the direction of ICE. In addition, public access to the federal court records related to those detentions is tightly restricted.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, the available records show Polk County, ICE and DHS are named as defendants in at least three additional cases recently filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Lt. Mark Chance of the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said Friday that 68 of the 993 inmates now housed at the Polk County Jail are detainees of DHS or ICE.
Nationally and in Iowa, many of the lawsuits surrounding ICE detainees involve the Trump administration’s six-month-old effort to expand its “mandatory detention” policy. Under that policy, ICE is holding people in jail indefinitely as their immigration cases proceed, while arguing those individuals are not entitled to a hearing where they can argue for their release on bond.
Politico recently reported that more than 300 federal judges, including appointees of every president since Ronald Reagan, have rejected the administration’s “mandatory detention” theory in more than 1,600 cases.
The courts’ near-universal rejection of the administration’s position has not prevented the U.S. Department of Justice from continuing to use that rationale to jail people indefinitely. In fact, the DOJ recently appealed one judge’s ruling against ICE after it resulted in a woman’s release from the Muscatine County Jail.
Polk County man detained during traffic stop
One of the newly filed cases involves Ulises Ramirez Cruz, who sued Polk County and ICE over his detention and the refusal of the immigration courts to provide him with a hearing at which he could argue for his release on bond.
Court records indicate Ramirez Cruz has lived in Iowa for five years. He alleges that ICE agents — identified in court records only as T. Staudinger, Scroggins, Palmer and Hanson — waited outside his house on Nov. 7, 2025, and then pulled him over after he left the house, got into his car and drove away.
U.S. Attorney David Waterman argued in court that Ramirez Cruz is not entitled to a bond hearing and is subject to mandatory detention. In a recent ruling against the government, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Locher noted he has rejected the DOJ’s arguments in at least three other cases that have come before him, and that judges around the country have “overwhelmingly” issued similar decisions.
Locher’s order directs the immigration court to provide Ramirez Cruz with an opportunity to argue for his release on bond while the underlying immigration case proceeds.
‘Punitive detention’ alleged in Polk County case 
The second recent case involves a Polk County Jail inmate, Luis Pedroso, a citizen of Cuba who has been in the United States for four and a half years. Pedroso has applied for status as a legal permanent resident of the United States, but as part of the approval process, he must prove he’s not ineligible on public-health grounds, which would involve a physical examination to rule out drug abuse and communicable diseases.
Under federal regulations, that examination must be provided by a physician selected by or approved by immigration authorities. Attorneys for Pedroso argue that the jail, Polk County Health Department and ICE are all unwilling or unable to provide Pedroso with a physician so the examination can be conducted. ICE is also unwilling to transfer Pedroso to a different jail so the examination can take place, they allege.
Pedroso’s attorneys claim ICE and the county have, in effect, denied Pedroso his status as a legal permanent resident and violated his right to due process.
“Keeping Pedroso in detention for the purpose of adjudicating his claim in immigration court transforms his detention into a punitive detention intending to punish him for the fact that he is eligible for legal permanent residency,” the lawsuit alleges.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response.
U.S. resident for 35 years, in jail for four months 
A third lawsuit involving the Polk County Jail revolves around Amir Rahimi of Centerville, a native of Iran who has lived in the United States for 35 years.
In his lawsuit against the county, ICE and DHS, Rahimi alleges he has been married to a native-born U.S. citizen for 33 years, with whom he has three children. The couple’s eldest son is in the U.S. Air Force and is currently deployed overseas, the lawsuit claims.
Rahimi alleges he was detained by federal agents when he stopped at an ICE office for a routine, scheduled appointment on July 22, 2025. At the time, he claims, ICE gave no reason for his detention except to tell him they were currently “seeking a third country for your removal” — suggesting the agency’s plan is to deport him not to Iran, but to some other country.
“After four months of detention, the legal justification for his detention still remains unclear and he has been provided with no explanation of the change in his circumstances that resulted in the deprivation of his liberty,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing Rahimi’s continued detention, citing alleged violations of Rahimi’s due process rights and the federal Immigration and Nationality Act.
Feds appeal ruling in Muscatine County case 
In addition to the newly filed lawsuits, a fourth lawsuit involving the Muscatine County Jail continues to move forward despite a judge’s ruling in the case in early November.
That case centers on Maria Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States from Mexico near Sasabe, Arizona, on Sept. 23, 2023, with her son, now 10 years old, and her husband. At the time, the family claimed they were fleeing persecution. They were detained briefly by the U.S. Border Patrol before being released on their own recognizance.
Reyes and her family subsequently filed formal applications for asylum to escape what they called persecution by Mexican drug cartels that are now recognized as terrorists by the U.S. government.
On Sept. 2, 2025, with that application still pending, the Reyes family went to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Cedar Rapids for a prescheduled “check in” appointment. According to court records, ICE agents accosted Reyes at the office and then sent her to the Muscatine County Jail. An immigration judge then denied her request for a bond hearing.
Reyes sued in U.S. District Court, and on Nov. 3, 2025, Judge Locher ruled in her favor, noting that the  majority of courts around the nation have rejected the administration’s interpretation of the law as requiring mandatory detention.
Locher noted that Reyes has lived in the United States with her family for two years and has no record of any criminal activity or dangerous conduct.
In ordering the immigration court to provide Reyes with a hearing on her request for pretrial release on bond, Locher wrote that “ICE itself obviously did not believe she was subject to mandatory detention” when they released her on how own recognizance in September 2023 and again in February 2025.
Court records indicate Reyes was granted bond after a hearing on Nov. 7, 2025, and was released from custody three days later on a $6,000 bond.
Despite Locher’s ruling and Reyes’ subsequent release, the U.S. Department of Justice is now appealing Locher’s ruling.

Community Colleges for Iowa will ask for additional funding and Last-Dollar Scholarship changes in the upcoming legislative session. (Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)With Iowa’s community college system set to celebrate 60 years of serving students, its leaders are getting ready to work with the Iowa Legislature to potentially implement new degree programs and curriculum.
Community Colleges for Iowa Executive Director Emily Shields said she agrees with lawmakers that community colleges are “one of Iowa’s best kept secrets,” and she hopes community colleges can receive the additional funding and program support to expand affordability and access for high school, college-age and adult learners.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia — chairs of the Iowa House Higher Education Committee and the Iowa Senate Education Committee, respectively — have said that community colleges will be a focus of the upcoming legislative session. Evans called community colleges one of Iowa’s “hidden gems” that the state needs to do a better job of promoting.
The Iowa Legislature created the statewide community college system 60 years ago this year, Shields said, and it has been a “national model” ever since.

“I just want people to know how much is available to them, affordably and locally, and our folks are so humble, so it is hard for me to get community college folks to brag on themselves and really talk about the great things that are available,” Shields said. “So to hear a legislator recognizing that is wonderful, and we want to continue to promote this incredible resource.”
New degrees, changing curriculum on the table this session
Community colleges will be asking for a $12 million increase in state funding for the next fiscal year, Shields said, mainly to keep up with increasing costs of goods and services and to keep pay and benefits competitive. Like the previous year, when community colleges implemented a funding formula designed and approved by college presidents to level out the institutions receiving more or less per-student funding, this additional funding will also further that process.
Some of those funds would also go toward implementing bachelor’s degree programs at community colleges, Shields said — if the Legislature decides to turn that potential into a reality.
Community Colleges for Iowa released a report in October 2025 exploring other states’ efforts to incorporate baccalaureate degrees into their academic offerings and what would be needed for Iowa to do the same, after prompting from Iowa lawmakers in the previous legislative session. Collins said implementing new community college degree programs will be a priority this session, but Shields said the usual state funding request won’t cover the costs entirely.
In addition to general state aid, Shields said Community Colleges for Iowa plans to request a $20 million fund for the creation of baccalaureate degrees at community colleges. The money will act as startup funding for these programs.
“That’s one of the things that we learned from other states, is that while the programs can be self-sustaining, it’s difficult to get them off the ground without initial funding to cover the costs related to hiring new faculty, training them, equipment, before the tuition is coming in the door,” Shields said.
Shields said introducing new kinds of degrees to community colleges wouldn’t change their collective mission so much as build upon it. The system’s mission is focused on workforce, credentials and degrees, as well as meeting unmet needs in local areas.
With 15 community colleges operating in more than 100 locations across Iowa and offering a more affordable education than public and some private universities, Shields said if community colleges can identify the needs of their local communities and develop bachelor’s degree programs to address them, these institutions “are uniquely positioned” to meet needs based on both affordability and geographical accessibility.
“Looking at where there are people who aren’t getting a bachelor’s degree now, but could and would if it was offered at their local community college, that’s the population that I know the Legislature will be considering, and we’re excited about this conversation,” Shields said.
Another priority Collins has discussed is further attempts to change core curriculum requirements at public universities, which he pointed out would impact community colleges as well. While it depends on the college, Shields said around half of community college students transfer to a four-year institution, and any changes community colleges would need to make to curriculum to keep the transfer process smooth and seamless just depends on what the to-be-introduced legislation targets.
Community colleges are also hoping to make changes to the Last-Dollar Scholarship Program, a scholarship fund which Shields said has been underspent, especially as the list of career fields included in the scholarship has been limited.
The Last-Dollar Scholarship Program provides eligible students attending a community college with enough money to fill any gaps left between their financial aid and the cost of tuition and fees. The Iowa Workforce Development Board voted in spring 2025 to limit the number of job fields that students must enroll in a program related to in order to receive Last-Dollar Scholarship funding, a decision that eliminated careers in law enforcement, medical and dental assisting, wastewater and more.
Shields said the program has been underspent the last couple of years, due to an income cap implemented a few years ago and what jobs were eligible for the program, and the new limitations on eligible job fields will “constrict” the money that’s supposed to be going to students even more.
“We’re looking for some legislative changes to expand that so the funds are getting to the students that need it,” Shields said.
Proposed legislation to address college transfers, career programs
One bill has already been filed ahead of the Jan. 12 start of the session, which would make changes to requirements for career academy courses, the articulation agreement between community colleges and state universities and programming aimed at helping high school students afford a concurrent education.
The proposed legislation, if adopted, would require career academies to offer at least two units of secondary education, one of which must meet requirements of a “district-to-community college sharing or concurrent enrollment program,” the bill explanation stated.
The statewide articulation agreement between community colleges and the Iowa Board of Regents, which governs Iowa’s public universities, would also be required to allow the transfer of career and technical education credits alongside academic credits.
Current law requires the Iowa Department of Education to create a fund to help high school students attend career and technical education classes relating to high-demand careers over the summer if the Legislature appropriates funds to such an initiative. The bill would require this fund be created regardless of whether money is appropriated to it or not.
A fund of $600,000 does exist for summer career and technical education, Shields said, but the need has far outweighed the funding. She said the potential of putting more money toward students who want to further their education and training would hopefully better address demand.
The bill would also require school districts that create personalized academic and career plans for students in eighth grade to also discuss with them opportunities within the school district to earn relevant college credits and “industry-recognized credentials,” the bill explanation stated.
Shields said conversations around career and technical education credit transfers, as well as establishing more dedicated funding for high school students hoping to earn those credits, have been ongoing for a couple of years as concurrent enrollment has grown.
“We’re excited anytime transfer is made easier for our students, because we want them to transfer on if that’s what’s in their plans, and it is the most difficult for career and technical education students,” Shields said.

The Natrona County District Attorney maintains the Wyoming Legislature was acting in its legal authority. 
The post Weston County clerk subpoena was valid, court filings argue appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming Legislature served a valid subpoena to Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock last fall and had the authority to do so, according to the latest filings in the criminal case against the embattled clerk. 
Hadlock pleaded not guilty in November to a misdemeanor charge accusing her of defying a legislative subpoena. Lawmakers subpoenaed the clerk in September to compel her to attend a meeting in Casper as part of an investigation into her conduct surrounding an initial miscount and audit in the 2024 general election. 
Despite the subpoena, she did not attend the meeting, informing the committee ahead of time that she had a scheduling conflict. Lawmakers subsequently pursued criminal charges. In November, the Natrona County District Attorney’s Office charged Hadlock with a misdemeanor for failing to appear. 
The subpoena, however, was void because lawmakers’ investigation was illegal, Ryan Semerad, Hadlock’s attorney, argued in a December motion to dismiss the case. 
More specifically, Semerad argued, the investigation into Hadlock was not the purview of the Legislature’s Management Audit Committee, and publicly conducting such an investigation violated the committee’s confidentiality statutes. 
Additionally, Hadlock was not given “fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to obtain counsel and meaningfully respond to the subpoena,” the filing states. 
Natrona County District Attorney Dan Itzen countered in a Thursday filing, arguing that the committee did have the authority to issue a legislative subpoena. 
“Additionally, the subpoena that the Defendant received was valid,” Itzen wrote. “Therefore, the defense’s two main arguments, that the subpoena was not properly issued and that the subpoena was defective, are ineffective.”
Itzen also pointed to the committee’s work, which included several bills that the full Legislature will consider when it convenes next month. 
“In this case, the [Management Audit Committee] subcommittee was auditing the Weston County Clerk 2024 election to determine if any future policy changes should be enacted to prevent similar misconduct from occurring in the future,” the filing states. “This purpose is exemplified by the subcommittee’s final report, which, after listing the subcommittee’s findings of fact, recommends four new policy changes.”
Hadlock knew the purpose of the subpoena and was informed of the consequences for failing to appear pursuant to her subpoena, Itzen wrote, and her absence was not excused. 
The filings also dispute that Hadlock was not given reasonable notice. 
The Legislative Service Office initially contacted Hadlock on Sept. 8, according to the filings. When she said she would not attend, Hadlock was served with a subpoena on Sept. 23. The meeting took place on Sept. 29. 
Hadlock “was put on notice that the subcommittee would likely want to hear her testimony well before the hearing,” Itzen wrote. “Thus, she had ample time to prepare to appear at the hearing and get counsel. Therefore, the defense cannot effectively argue that the defendant was unfairly surprised by this subpoena, and, therefore, the subpoena was invalid.”
Ultimately, whether Hadlock received reasonable notice, Itzen wrote, should be left to the jury, as should “any factual determinations.”
The case also presents “a separation of powers issue,” Itzen wrote, urging the court not to dismiss the case. 
By granting the motion to dismiss, “the Court would be denying the legislature any deference by overstepping into legislative action taken at a legislative hearing,” Itzen wrote. “Judicial involvement would blur the lines between the legislative and judicial branches of government.”
A hearing in the case is set for Jan. 21.
The latest filings come amid Gov. Mark Gordon’s decision to direct the Wyoming Attorney General’s office to seek Hadlock’s removal from office for “her failure to appear for a legislative subpoena and her filing of a false audit report in conjunction with her duties as the Clerk of Weston County,” according to the governor. She does not plan to resign, Semerad told WyoFile.

Mickelson Law Enforcement Center in Pierre, South Dakota, on July 8, 2024. (Photo by John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Failure to disclose past misconduct by a law enforcement officer can be enough to overturn a criminal conviction, even if that misconduct was decades old and unrelated to the crime that drew the conviction.
Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel said that’s why she asked South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley to convene a task force to standardize the collection, reporting and sharing of information about officer misconduct.
“My goal is that there would be somewhere that prosecutors and law enforcement agencies could go and share information,” said Roetzel, who was named a member of the task force when Jackley announced its creation in a press release last month. 
Details of past misbehavior are often referred to as “Giglio” or “Brady” evidence, named for the two U.S. Supreme Court cases that determined defendants have the right to know about any past dishonesty or ethical lapses by the witnesses against them.
Under those decisions, potentially damning but undisclosed evidence can upend a conviction even if a prosecutor wasn’t aware the evidence existed beforehand.
Migrant officers flock to South Dakota police departments

In an era when police officers regularly move from place to place, Roetzel said, it’s important for prosecutors to be able to keep tabs on which officers have misconduct in their personal histories. There’s no guarantee an officer’s previous employer will pass along information.
Other states also struggle with disclosure, according to a 2022 Minnesota Law Review article. 
Some agencies in some jurisdictions disclose all manner of police misconduct, wrote Rachel Moran, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law. Other agencies may only share and maintain information about dishonesty. 
Misconduct lists across the U.S., she wrote, “vary widely and are almost completely unregulated.”
The issue is a significant concern for South Dakota, Roetzel said, which has welcomed a host of officers moving in from out of state in recent years. 
“I saw several situations where an officer would move to another jurisdiction, and I felt like I needed to make a call” to the prosecutor in the officer’s jurisdiction, Roetzel said.
Attorney general: Disclosure is ‘foundation of our credibility’
Attorney General Jackley sits on the Law Enforcement Officers Standards and Training Commission, which reviews applications for reciprocity by out-of-state officers and considers requests for reinstatement from officers who’ve gotten into trouble and want a second chance.
The commission also acts as a jury when an officer accused of misconduct decides to push back against the allegations to avoid sanction.
The Giglio implications of an officer’s behavior are especially important considerations for the commission, Jackley said. Criminal behavior, unethical conduct, and allegations of racism or sexism could all impact an officer’s reliability on the witness stand, Jackley said, but dishonest conduct such as lying in a police report or search warrant application can be the most damning at a trial.
Honesty and disclosure of all the facts, he said, “is the foundation of our credibility in the courtroom.”

Jackley and Roetzel both said the task force’s creation wasn’t prompted by an overturned conviction, but is preemptive. Every member comes from law enforcement, Jackley said, because “it’s the obligation of law enforcement to disclose.” 
Jackley’s press release on the task force said the group will review the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on disclosure and the further decisions that refined what does or doesn’t constitute evidence of misconduct. After that, the group will “make recommendations on how South Dakota law enforcement agencies can comply with the intent and spirit of the decisions. 
Misdeeds or allegations of misdeeds that may not be enough to threaten an officer’s certification may nonetheless qualify as evidence that must be disclosed to a defense lawyer, he said. 
Jackley said something like a database of misconduct is a possibility, but the first step will be for the group to find a “framework” for what needs to be disclosed and when.
Jackley is running for Congress as a Republican, and is not seeking reelection as the state’s attorney general. He said the decision to create the commission was meant in part to “finish strong” as attorney general by working to improve the justice system for years to come.
Protecting law enforcement
Deuel County Sheriff Cory Borg will serve as board president for the South Dakota Sheriff’s Association for 2026. He’ll serve as the county sheriff representative on the new Giglio task force, alongside other working officer representatives from the Highway Patrol and Vermillion Police Department.
Borg, who’s served as sheriff since 2018, has five deputies to patrol his county, which includes the cities of Clear Lake, Toronto and Brandt. He’s never had to report any misconduct from those deputies, he said, but wouldn’t hesitate to do so. 










Nobody hates a bad officer as much as a good officer.


– Deuel County Sheriff Cory Borg


The public sets a high ethical bar for officers and should, he said, since officers serve as public servants. A “bad apple” officer who grabs headlines or tanks a criminal case with dishonesty damages the public’s perception of the field.
“Nobody hates a bad officer as much as a good officer,” Borg said.
Back in Pennington County, Roetzel said she hopes the task force isn’t viewed as a group that’s out to get police. Attending to ethical issues on the front end, she said, shows people that the state respects the rule of law and those who seek to uphold it.
“This is not anti-law enforcement,” she said. “We want to protect law enforcement.”
The group will hold an organizational meeting later this month, according to Jackley’s office, after which its remaining meeting dates will be set.

Bishop William J. Barber II choked back emotion as he reflected on Wednesday’s untimely death of Renee Nicole Good, the 37-year-old mother who was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis.
“My God, they’re killing mothers. And the grossest image that I’ve seen in a long time — you have an [airbag] covered with blood and baby dolls in the dashboard,” said Barber in recalling his reaction to seeing the videos of Good’s shooting which have been widely circulated on social media.

“The question in this moment is what kind of systems, what kind of attitudes create the atmosphere that can gin somebody up to the point that they would shoot a woman, a mother, at point blank range?” Barber asked.
The Department of Homeland Security and President Donald Trump maintain the ICE agent was acting in “self-defense.”
Barber did not see it that way.
“Because the spirit of hate has been unleashed. If it’s not turned around, it could destroy us all,” he warned.
Barber’s remarks came as a coalition of North Carolina religious and advocacy organizations held a Friday press conference to announce “This Is Our Selma,” a memorial march from Wilson to Raleigh in mid-February.
Barber said North Carolinians are tired of hate and tired of regressive policies that threaten Medicaid, restrict voting rights and instill fear in immigrant communities.
The coalition includes Repairers of the Breach, Indivisible, the North Carolina Council of Churches, the North Carolina Poor People’s Campaign and the Union of Southern Service Workers.
Organizers say the need for a massive march became even more apparent after legislative leaders decided last fall to redraw North Carolina’s congressional districts at the request of President Donald Trump to favor Republicans in the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Critics have argued the new map undermines the voting power of the state’s rural Black voters in the 1st congressional district, which has been represented by Black lawmakers for decades.
The 1st district seat, currently held by U.S. Rep. Don Davis, was North Carolina’s only competitive House seat. The Cook Political Report notes that race is no longer a toss-up. The seat leans Republican.
“That’s the only reason people do all this tricky redistricting and try to block voting rights is because they have considered that they cannot win in a fair fight,” said Barber, calling the new map blatant and racist.
Rev. Dr. Hanna Broome, director of religious affairs for Repairers of the Breach and president of the NC Council of Churches, said the march from Wilson to Raleigh is not only a commemoration of a historic moment, but a continuation.
“156 years after the ratification of the 15th Amendment, we are still pressing forward toward the promise of justice and democracy for all people,” Broome said.
Dennis Gaddy, executive director of the North Carolina Community Success Initiative, said he was moved by a sign in the chapel that read, “We won’t be diluted, we won’t be dismissed.” Gaddy said his nonprofit represents thousands of people who have at one time or another found themselves entangled with the criminal justice system and are turning their lives around.
“And there are people now who are eligible to vote that don’t know it, and they need to be empowered to go to the polls,” Gaddy said. “That’s one of the things we’ll be doing along this movement.”
In-person, early voting for the March 2026 primaries begins Feb. 12, and the group hopes the march will put a spotlight on that opportunity to be heard.
Barber encouraged the group to not speak out against the policies or an administration they oppose, but to speak out boldly in support of policies they would love to see pass including healthcare for all, fully funded public education, and living wages.
“All over the nation, people of goodwill must decide now to stand and push for democracy and a society worth having and then love forward to get it.”

Contemporary paganism is on the rise nationwide — and Vermont’s witches say it’s taken root here as well.

Maggie Byers first felt drawn to paganism during a rough patch in her life. 
Her marriage fell apart during the Covid-19 pandemic, and she began to reevaluate many aspects of herself that she’d taken for granted: her relationships, her body, her career. 
When her mother sent her a video of people reading Tarot cards, she decided to visit a Tarot reader for the first time. The experience went beyond what she could have imagined, as she felt the medium connect her with her departed relatives. 
“I’m driving home thinking, ‘I forgot about spirituality,’” she said. “All of the things that I was working on for myself, it was all grounded in the earth.”
It took another year of research and experimentation for her to identify as pagan, but it now plays an integral role in her life, whether it’s Tarot, manifesting desires through positive thinking, following the moon cycles or sitting side-by-side with her father, a Christian minister, as they both pray. 
In some ways, Americans have become less religious than ever. A decadeslong Pew study found the percentage of Americans with any religious affiliation is dropping, and Vermont in particular has the second-lowest religious affiliation of any state. 
Yet at the same time, there’s been a small but steady rise in the percentage of Americans who identify as contemporary pagans, an umbrella term that includes paganism as well as Wicca, witchcraft and a host of other belief systems. Helen Berger, a researcher at Brandeis University, calls it the “third wave” of interest in paganism after the surge in Wicca in the 1960s and renewed interest in the 1990s. 
It’s harder to say if Vermont is part of that trend, since the absolute numbers are still very small. Pew’s study, for example, reports that only 1% of Vermonters identify as pagan or Wiccan. But interviews with Vermonters who practice these beliefs suggest there is a thriving community of practitioners in the Green Mountain State.
The state’s connection to paganism surged in the 1960s and 1970s, when the back-to-the-land movement drew in migrants with more liberal and alternative beliefs. Doc Bradley, a politics and religion professor at the University of Vermont, said in October that the rise of the counterculture movement in that period prompted a shift away from mainstream religious systems in the Green Mountain State. 
Berger said contemporary pagans tend to be more common in urban environments than rural ones, but Vermont may be an exception to that rule because of its counterculture history. There are “a lot of hippies” in Vermont, she said, who could feel drawn to paganism or witchcraft for its lack of authority structure and practice of alternative healing methods.
Vermonters may also be open to contemporary paganism because of its association with feminism and environmentalism, Berger said. Many branches of it celebrate and even worship nature. 
“People go to Vermont to feel closer to nature,” Berger said. “We’re always in nature, but the concrete makes us feel more distant from it in the city, possibly.”
Today’s contemporary pagans are different from previous generations, Berger said. They’re more likely to practice alone, more likely to connect to their beliefs through online sources and more likely to find their own preferred practices rather than following set paths of study. 
“If you want to become a witch, you go online, and they say, ‘this is what you need to practice,’” Berger said. When she was studying covens in the 1990s, “people made a lot of their own tools, or they would buy them individually. Now you can buy these packages from Walmart.”
That accessibility, Berger said, has made contemporary paganism appealing to people who feel disconnected from the rigidity of other religious traditions. The most common religion remains Christianity, with 45% of Vermont adults identifying as Christians.  
“It’s considered a spirituality, rather than an institutional religion,” she said. “There’s no church, mosque, temple, synagogue to attain. It’s much more open to your own interpretation. People do magic, and they feel it works.”
Finding the light
The winter solstice, which was Dec. 21 last year, is one of the most important holidays in the pagan calendar, Berger said. It represents a celebration of the return of the light, since each day after the solstice will gradually get longer. 
Byers has created her own tradition for her family. Each year, they hang pine cones on a tree with little scraps of paper that represent their wishes for 2026. 
“It’s almost like writing to Santa Claus,” she said. 
Then in February, the deepest part of winter, they burn the pine cones to “release that energy.”
Manifesting is one of many practices that commonly fall under the realm of contemporary paganism, Berger said. Others are as diverse as the pagans and witches who practice them: tarot, spellwork, astrology, using crystals and herbs and worshipping the goddess or other divine figures are some of the most cited. 
For Cassandra, a recent Vermont convert to witchcraft, meditation with herbs and candles is the ritual that has brought her the most peace and spiritual connection in her everyday life. 
“It’s not about clearing your mind of thoughts, as some people will tell you; it is so much more about taking in your senses and regrounding in your body,” said Cassandra, who asked not to use her full name due to concerns about harassment for her beliefs. 
Jillian Kirby, a Burlington-based witch, said her favorite part of witchcraft was the altar she created for her ancestors above her cooking range. The altar has small objects that belonged to each of her deceased loved ones.

Kirby took an indirect path to her identity as a witch. Raised as a Christian churchgoer, she became a “really intense” atheist in her early adulthood. But she found herself missing the “sense of mystery” she found in church services. 
Then she found an online community of atheopagans, atheists who incorporate pagan philosophy and traditions into their lives. Kirby sometimes describes herself as a “placebo witch” and has become an ordained atheopagan cleric. 
“(There are) a lot of things that from the outside would look very specifically like the idea of spell work, but without any implication of there being a spiritual or other worldly power at work in those things,” she said. 
Kirby said online spaces have allowed many people to discover paganism or witchcraft, or their own specific niche within those beliefs, in a way that wasn’t as easy in the pre-internet era. 
“There were so many people who were sort of existing and had their own thoughts and their own practices and maybe some little thing here or there,” she said. “And then social media comes. Then people start connecting via the internet, and you find all these other people in your immediate community who are doing these weird little things that you’re into, and then they’re doing other things. And you sort of can expand your practice.” 
Byers said she was surprised to learn there were so many other Vermont witches. Although she occasionally connects with other witches on social media, she hasn’t quite gotten around to attending a local witches meetup in White River Junction. 
“It’s a busy life, and it’s hard to get out,” she said. “So I haven’t made that a priority yet.”
Berger said she’s also encountered witches who view their practice through a more symbolic lens. 
“You could still have the experiences, but not believe in it in a divine or another world way, but you’re having an experience, and those experiences are meaningful,” she said. 
Vermont may have a low rate of religious affiliation, but data from the Pew Religious Survey suggests some Vermonters without a specific religious affiliation still have spiritual views. While only 54% of Vermonters identify as part of a named religion, 81% said they believed in a soul or spirit, and 70% said they believe in something spiritual beyond the natural world. 
“They still have these experiences, feelings, needs,” Berger said. “And one way in which this need is being met is witchcraft, the metaphysical religions and being in nature.” 
Witch hunts, old and new
Modern-day contemporary paganism has few ties to the accusations of witchcraft that led to witch hunts and killings in colonial New England. Amanda Van Epps, the Vermont commissioner on women and a disability advocate, said the historical label of “witch” had more to do with who was viewed as an outsider than the person’s actual beliefs and practices. 
“The so-called ‘witch’ was really just a linguistic label signaling that someone had been singled out by their community, not so much a reflection of the practices or the beliefs of people who identify as witches today,” she said. “And I would say ironically, it wasn’t the accused who were hysterical, but rather society itself.”
Yet there have been women who describe themselves as witches as a way of reclaiming their power in a patriarchal system, she said. 
From the first wave of interest in contemporary paganism in the 1960s, the movement has been connected to feminism and the feminine divine, Berger said. 
“It is drawing in women and particularly girls because of empowerment, this sense of empowerment,” she said. 
She’s also observed a higher-than-average rate of people in the LGBTQ+ community identifying as contemporary pagans. 
“There is a hetero-centralism within Wicca,” she said. “But from the beginning, the groups that were forming were very open to alternatives, which meant alternative lifestyles and alternatives for whom you might love or create a family with. So all along there have been more gay, more trans people within paganism than in the general population.”
There’s been a long history of discrimination against contemporary pagans, stemming in part from a mistaken connection between paganism and Satanism. Van Eps said there was a certain irony to the fact that modern-day practitioners face the same accusations that victims of historic witch hunts did, even though they have no documented connection to each other. 
“Unfortunately for those who identify as a witch today, or are trying to reclaim their femininity, they may be targeted just because of the word ‘witch,’” even though their ideology is “completely different” than what they’re being accused of, Van Eps said. 
Berger said some witches in the past have lost custody of their kids because their ex-spouse argued they were an “unfit parent.” In other instances, public rituals have been disrupted or called out by Christian ministers or other religious figures as “evil.” 
The stigma continues, even in Vermont. One business owner who sells witchcraft-related products pulled out of an interview with VTDigger because, she said via email, she’s received harassing phone calls accusing her of Satanism. 
Kirby recalled taking out a book from the library as a child that happened to contain a description of palm readings. Her devout Christian grandmother made her return the book. 
“It took me a long time to not feel like I had to pretend I was just still Christian with my very intensely religious family,” she said. 
It was becoming a parent that made her realize she needed to make a more conscious decision to openly embrace her beliefs. 
“Really purposely crafting that for my kid has really grounded me in like, ‘No, this is really the choice I’m making, and it’s a completely valid choice,’” she said. 
Byers said she would study a person at first to get a sense of whether they would object to her beliefs before opening up to them about it. She also tries to find common ground with people from other religions by finding the overarching principles of love and kindness. 
“The same ideas of like, giving gratitude, forgiving yourself, being humble — it’s all the same context, just different words,” she said. 
At the same time, Vermont’s witches and pagans are able to be critical of what they see as missteps within their own movement. Cassandra said she’s cautious about avoiding “closed practices,” or rituals and beliefs that are tied to specific marginalized groups. She gave the example of sage burning or smudging, which is associated with Indigenous tribes.
“The most important thing would be to be respectful and do your homework, because a connection with witchcraft is is about your own interpretation, true, but it’s best to approach that interpretation from a respectful standpoint of people who have been practicing these spells, festivities, what have you for thousands of years,” she said. 
Byers said she tries to avoid any practice that could interfere with another person’s free will, like hexing someone. 
“That’s just bad juju,” she said. 
To her, witchcraft is more of an internal practice that has allowed her to see life in a new day. She said it has helped her quell her fear of dying and leaving people behind. 
“I have that type of faith that whatever is meant to be will happen, and that somebody will come in and take care of my kids, or people will move on and grieve as they need to,” Byers said. “So it really took away fear of dying and leaving people behind and also taking away the fear of living my life.”

This old saying comes to mind as the State of Michigan, now going back decades, has threatened to privatize or what I call the “profitization” of public community-based behavioral health, better known to many as mental health and addiction services.
These vital community resources have been provided at the local level going back to President John F. Kennedy’s administration and are desperately needed to bring a semblance of help and human decency to individuals and their families who are combating serious mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities and substance use disorders.
Using the euphemism of “bidding out or redesigning the system of care” the state under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services, going back to Governor Engler’s administration, have attempted to give the insurance companies control of billions of our tax dollars to “manage” these services.
The courts slowed down the state’s action and a recent court pronouncement resulted in a “kissing your sister ruling,” as a long-time watcher said, not fully satisfying either the department or advocates fighting the state move.
Michigan court rules state’s mental health procurement plan violates law

The ball appears to be back in Governor  Whitmer and State Department of Health and Human Services Director Hertel’s hands on how they wish to proceed.
They should follow the railway warning: Stop, look and listen.
Those advocating for the “redesign” believe it will modernize the system of care and provide better outcomes than the current system. Those advocating for the change provide no evidence or data that the changes will add any additional value or make a difference to persons in need and their families’ lives.
To the contrary these proposed changes would result in a loss of local control, increase administrative costs, replace a publicly managed care system that has a 2% overhead with a privately managed profit care system that has up to a 20% overhead.
In a strongly worded open letter to Michigan’s Governor and the State Legislature, the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI-MI) made it abundantly clear they oppose the “redesign” process saying: “The RFP/bid out process represents a significant and damaging shift in the structure and delivery of behavioral health services in our state with far-reaching harm to the ability of Michiganders to receive needed mental health care and to the locally driven system upon which 300,000 Michiganders (and the 1 million family members) have come to rely.”
The Community Mental Health Association of Michigan which is opposed to the redesign process says it provides, “serious risks without addressing the system’s core challenges.”  The organization goes on to say, “Other states that have pursued similar restructuring have experienced higher costs, workforce losses, fragmented services and diminished access for those most in need. Michigan must not repeat those mistakes.”
Debbie Stabenow, who has spent her professional career of over a half century serving as a county commissioner, state Representative, state Senator, U.S. House member and U.S. senator, has been a staunch advocate and supporter of a strong community based public mental health system. She has been a vocal critic of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services plan to privatize the state’s public mental health system.
Stabenow retired from the U.S. Senate in January 2025 but has continued to voice her opposition against the Whitmer’s administration’s effort to the state’s proposal since it was introduced in 2024.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Tenacious Debbie has ferociously argued that the state’s privatization proposal would be detrimental to patients and the public system as a whole by increasing costs, decreasing access, reduce transparency and accountability and concluded saying that Michigan’s mental health system is in need of greater public investment — not being put up for private management.
The former senator has earned the respect and admiration of  behavioral health consumers, their families and community based providers across Michigan and deserves to be listened to, and more importantly, followed.
Wishful thinking by state government is neither a strategy nor a plan. Consumers and their families fear these changes and don’t believe the state with their mantra, “We are from the government and we are here to help you.”
In her final year in office Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the Legislature must pull together to enhance and improve public mental health access and integration of care in the new year. “Profitizing” it by turning it over to profit-driven insurance companies is not the answer.
Period- full stop!
This is not a side issue that impacts “those people.” Mental health and substance use disorders impact every ZIP code and one in four people across this great nation of ours. Dr. Vivek Murthy, former U.S. Surgeon General, says the mental health crisis is the biggest health concern facing the country because it impacts so many people and different facets of life.
This fact was recently bought home by the death of the iconic actor and film producer, Rob Reiner, and his wife Michelle, by their son Nick Reiner, who has been charged with their murders. Nick has struggled with mental health and addiction issues since his adolescence.
We need to listen to those most directly impacted by these threatened changes. There is a palpable fear among parents, consumers and advocates that the public mental health safety net will be ripped to shreds. Family members worry about losing long-term relationships with trusted providers and new rules that limit service. Given the struggles to get what they have, their worries are not without merit.
Critics say Michigan’s plan to open mental health contracts to bidding will outsource local care

The voices of county sheriffs, boards of county commissioners, police officer associations, local hospitals, the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan, National Alliance of Mental Illness, Michigan Mental Health Association and other advocacy organizations are opposing this false promise that would place profits before people.
The so called “redesign” is not truly about solutions to the real issues facing a system of care that does need additional support and sensible consumer-focused reforms. We must do better by serving not profiting from persons with behavioral health needs.
Here’s how we continue the pursuit of an integrated health care system that maximizes public resources, is consumer and community-focused and is data-driven and evidence-based:

Eliminate the separation of physical health care services from behavioral health care. Integrate care at the consumer level where no person is turned away. Treat the whole person; the mind is connected to the body;
Shut down services that continually abuse taxpayers’ resources while enriching themselves at the expense of those most vulnerable;
Create crisis intervention teams for law enforcement agencies throughout the state. Such partnerships between law enforcement and behavioral health care providers considerably improve care while reducing police officer injuries and costs when responding to mental health crisis calls. Sadly, our jails and prisons have become 21st-century psychiatric holding cells;
Significantly step up audits on Medicare/Medicaid providers to identify and prevent fraud and abuse;
Pay livable wages to direct-care staff. Stop the rhetoric about “supporting ‘essential’ workers” while paying invaluable staffers a pittance, often with no benefits.
Fund advocacy organizations adequately to enable them to hold the system accountable. Without their watchdog eyes and ears the system will slip off track with devastating consequences to people’s lives;
End the stigma of mental illness. Channel funds toward researching the causes of serious mental illness and developing responses to these disorders;
Utilize digital technologies and artificial intelligence which have the potential to profoundly impact behavioral health services. We need to use predictive analytics to design programs that help people engage with behavioral health services. Smart analytics could help educate people about behavioral health services;
Continue insurance reimbursement for virtual mental health services after the COVID-19 crisis subsides. It works;
Address shortages of certain specialty providers, including psychiatrists as well as eating disorder and autism specialists;
Fund local community mental health agencies to work with schools to address psychosocial issues students face that were exacerbated by the pandemic;
Create partnerships between behavioral health services and employers to boost awareness, acceptance, prevention and recovery within the workplace;
Move nonviolent persons with serious mental health issues currently in our prison system to appropriate behavioral health programs;
Hold hospitals accountable for serving people with serious mental illness. Michigan needs to get serious about using all the tools at its disposal, including certificates of need, licensing and tax policy forcing hospitals to accept public money to serve patients. Finding a psychiatric bed for someone with serious mental illness can often feel like their name is Mary or Joseph and it is Dec. 24 in Bethlehem. It is unconscionable that people with mental illness in need of hospital settings are denied service.

Decisions that benefit consumers and taxpayers instead of the “system” will lead us to a path that adds value and makes a difference. Without a shift in emphasis from profit to quality care, future policymakers will be confronted with an unfathomable mess to clean up.
Let’s work together to enhance care, support and opportunities for strangers, friends and family members with an illness or disability. A friend with cerebral palsy once called me a TAB: temporarily able-bodied. He explained that we are all one life-changing event away from needing some level of assistance. There, but for the grace of God, go I.
Everything we do should create a life of dignity and self-determination for our fellow citizens. We ought to proceed as though our actions will impact someone’s mother, father, sister, brother or son or daughter – because ultimately it will.
Let’s move forward, getting past the turf protection and place our focus on integrating care for our families and neighbors in need of quality mental health and substance use services.
People over profits.

Kelly Armstrong on Friday touted the success of the state’s application for federal Rural Health Transformation Program funding, which landed one of the largest per-capita awards in the nation.
North Dakota received $199 million for the first year of the five-year grant.
Congress set aside $50 billion for the program in its reconciliation bill last year as a way to offset losses rural states will incur due to Medicaid cuts.
The funding, awarded to North Dakota in late December, is almost double the minimum funding available to states this year.

The funding amounts to roughly $561 per North Dakota resident, according to an analysis by policy research organization KFF. Only six states received larger per-capita awards. The average grant amount was about $200 million per state.
States are guaranteed at least $500 million over the five-year period, but could receive more depending on the strength of their applications and other factors. 
Hoeven, a Republican, said his goal is for North Dakota to receive the maximum possible award of $1 billion.
He pointed to North Dakota’s existing hospital and communications infrastructure as factors that set its application apart.
The state has a very short window to get the money out into the hands of communities. North Dakota has until the end of September 2026 to obligate the funding, and until September 2027 to spend it.
The state Department of Health and Human Services is hiring a liaison to help tribal communities apply for the federal funding. Tribes’ unique legal status means their applications for grant money may have different requirements, Armstrong said. 
“We want to make sure that they have access to somebody on our staff that helps them do that and gives them the best chance of success,” the Republican said.
State lawmakers will convene for a special legislative session later this month to authorize the spending of the grant money.
North Dakota receives $199 million in federal grant for rural health care

A committee of lawmakers tasked with guiding the state’s application for Rural Health Transformation Program funding will meet Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the $200 million award and to discuss bill drafts for the special session.
While Armstrong called the special session to allocate the federal funding, lawmakers could also consider legislation related to other issues.
Legislative Management will meet on Wednesday to discuss the scope of the session.
Legislators will consider four policy bills that the state pledged to adopt in its Rural Health Transformation Program application. They would require schools to participate in a federal fitness test, require ongoing nutrition education for doctors, have North Dakota join a physician assistant licensure compact and to expand the services pharmacists are authorized to provide.
The federal government indicated that states with these policies would get larger grant awards.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Democratic leaders in the Washington state Legislature said Friday they have no plans to hold hearings on two conservative-backed initiatives focused on parental rights of students in public schools and banning transgender athletes from playing girls’ sports.
Both Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, and House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, staked out this position in remarks to reporters. It creates a high likelihood that both of the initiatives will go before Washington voters on midterm ballots this November.
“I’m certain that we will not be passing either of those initiatives,” Pedersen said. “They’ll be up to the voters to decide.”
The political committee Let’s Go Washington said it turned in more than 400,000 signatures for each of the two initiatives last week. Brian Heywood, the hedge fund manager who leads the group, urged lawmakers to reconsider holding hearings. 
“Not only would this be a blatant slap in the face to the hundreds of thousands of Democrat, Independent, and Republican voters who support the measures, it would be a clear sign that they don’t care about the abuses to children, families, and female athletes taking place in the state,” Heywood said in a statement.
Gov. Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said he hasn’t read the initiatives but “it’d be the first time I ever supported a Bill Heywood initiative,” making an apparent flub of Heywood’s first name.
“If what you’re hearing is the Legislature saying it should go to the voters for a vote, I tend in general, as a general matter, I don’t have a problem,” he told reporters Friday.
The vows from legislative Democrats don’t come as a surprise. 
The parental rights measure would immediately undo a new state law Democrats fought to pass last year. That law rewrote a Let’s Go Washington initiative known as the parental “bill of rights” that lawmakers passed in 2024.
IL26-001 would repeal the changes made to the 2024 initiative by House Bill 1296, one of the most controversial bills passed in the 2025 legislative session. Democrats said the rewrite was necessary to clarify the earlier Heywood-backed initiative, which sought to codify rights for parents of public school students under age 18. 
The goal of the 2024 initiative was to ensure parents have easy access to school materials, their child’s medical records and immediate notification if a child is involved in a crime. One of the major changes in last year’s legislation removed parental access to medical records.
IL26-638 looks to block transgender girls from competing in girls’ sports.
Even though Ferguson said he wasn’t an expert on the initiatives, he said, “We live in a world right now where trans kids are going through a lot.”
“I want to support trans kids,” he said. 
Ferguson also had a brief but tense exchange with conservative commentator Brandi Kruse, who asked about his position on the initiative, given his daughter competes in school sports. The governor responded by suggesting Kruse has an “obsession with trans kids.”
Both measures appear to have enough signatures to move forward to the Legislature, then to voters in November. But the secretary of state’s office still needs to certify the initiatives before they can be considered. That’ll likely take several weeks. 
Lawmakers technically have three options with the citizen initiatives. They can approve them and make them law, though that won’t happen in this case. They can send them to the ballot for voters to decide, the presumed outcome here. Or they could pass an alternative to an initiative, leaving it up for voters to weigh in on both.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump’s administration contracted last month with The GEO Group to operate a dormant prison in Hudson as an immigrant detention center for at least six months, according to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado.
The documents, released by the ACLU on Thursday after a Freedom of Information Act request, are the clearest indication yet that federal immigration authorities have prioritized reopening the facility in Hudson, located about 30 miles northeast of Denver, as they ramp up detention capacity in Colorado in pursuit of Trump’s mass deportation plans.
The dormant Big Horn Correctional Facility, formerly known as the Hudson Correctional Facility, is a 1,200-bed prison that operated for a span of just five years after its 2009 opening. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement contract for “comprehensive detention services” at the facility was issued to The GEO Group on Dec. 1, 2025, but the amount and terms of the contract are redacted in the documents.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries about the released documents or when the Hudson facility might reopen. The documents also contain a previous $39 million contract for The GEO Group to operate the facility for the six-month period beginning in April of last year, but the prison remained empty.
ACLU advocates criticized the government’s heavy redactions of the released documents, with Tim Macdonald, the ACLU of Colorado’s legal director, demanding “more transparency into how (ICE officials) plan to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to imprison more people who have not been convicted of any crime.”
In his second term, Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Colorado is currently home to only one ICE detention center, an Aurora facility also operated by The GEO Group. The Hudson facility is one of six potential new sites for ICE detention under consideration in Colorado, a list that also includes the dormant Huerfano County Correctional Center in Walsenburg and the Southern Ute Indian Adult Detention Center in Ignacio. The three new facilities would expand ICE’s Colorado footprint by a total of 2,560 additional beds, tripling its detention capacity in the state.
The latest records obtained by the ACLU also contain a document known as a “Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition,” or JOFOC, which is required when the federal government awards a contract without a competitive bidding process — but the 98-page file is completely redacted.
In August, following the passage of $45 billion in funding for expanded immigration detention in Republicans’ spending and tax cut law, GEO Group chairman George Zoley spoke during an earnings call about the “attractive opportunity for investors” presented by “the unprecedented growth opportunities we anticipate will materialize over the balance of this year and next year.”
“The documents we received from ICE fail to answer fundamental questions about the agency’s planned expansion for the Denver field office,” Scott Medlock, a senior staff attorney with the Colorado ACLU, said in a statement. “With Congress allocating unprecedented resources and funding to ICE and DHS, the public deserves to know how the federal government intends to use this infusion of money.”

(Julia Goldberg/SourceNM)With the start of 2026, expect to see a ramp-up toward New Mexico’s June 2 primary and, of course, the Nov. 3 midterms. Source NM will be both rounding up and digging into the election cycle. For now, here’s an overview of campaign activity in the first week of the year.
Signature scamper
More than a dozen candidates have announced campaigns for New Mexico’s top executive office in the 2026 election, as current Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, is term-limited from running again. 
In order to appear on the ballot, candidates running with either of the state’s major Democratic or Republican parties must collect a little more than 2,000 signatures from members of their political parties and submit them to the Secretary of State by a Feb. 3 deadline, according to state law. 
The secretary of state’s office will publish the petition forms for minor party and independent candidates, including the required number of signatures, by March 31. Those candidates have until June 25 to file for candidacy, since they do not participate in the primary elections. 
The law requires that signatures for the major party candidates represent 2% of registered voters in the party who voted in the last gubernatorial primary election. For Democrats that number is 2,505 and for Republican candidates that’s 2,351 signatures, according to the state’s election information guide. 
Candidates have until the deadline to collect signatures, and then submit that along with other paperwork to the Secretary of State, according to Alex Curtas, a spokesperson for the office.
“At this point no one is officially a candidate for anything,” Curtas told Source NM in an email. “People have made announcements and ‘declared’ they are running, but no one is officially running until the paperwork is submitted and verified/accepted by our office on candidate filing day.”
Four candidates have reported exceeding the signature counts in statements from their campaigns. They include Democratic candidates Deb Haaland, the former Secretary of the Interior and U.S. congresswoman, who reported exceeding the minimum within 24 hours in October; and Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman, who has gathered more than 8,000 signatures, his campaign spokesperson told Source NM on Friday.
Republican candidates Gregg Hull, the mayor of Rio Rancho; and recent entry to the race Duke Rodriguez, a cannabis businessman and former cabinet secretary under former Gov. Gary Johnson, also said they’ve met the threshold. 
Rodriguez said in a news release this week he had collected more than 6,000 signatures.
“This wasn’t about checking a box. It was about earning trust,” Rodriguez said in a statement. “Every signature represents a real person who took time to participate, engage, and make their voice heard. That matters.”
 
New entries


While no campaign will be official until the Feb. 3 filing day, candidates are still announcing their entries into the race.
James “Jim” Ellis, a former Public Regulation Commissioner appointed by Lujan Grisham in 2023, who served until 2024, unveiled his website earlier this week, saying his platform is building “affordability, opportunity, and trust in government.” An emailed request for comment was not returned by deadline.
Ellis is the fourth candidate to seek the Republican nomination, with a field that includes Hull, Rodriguez and Sen. Steve Lanier (R-Aztec). Lanier has served in the state senate since his election in 2024, and served one term as a San Juan County commissioner. 
Dem contenders report additional events, endorsements
Haaland opened the new year with a donation of more than 350 books Friday to the Albuquerque-based literacy nonprofit Read to Me!
“By investing in education we invest in New Mexico’s future. As governor, I’ll prioritize making sure kids can read early on day one,” she said in a social media post.
Also this week, Bregman received the endorsement of Ohkay Owingeh, his third tribal endorsement.
Ohkay Owingeh Governor Benny J. Lujan said in a Jan. 5 statement that Bregman “respects our sovereignty and understands the realities facing our community,”  in the official endorsement. 
“He listens, he follows through, and he approaches tribal nations as partners not afterthoughts. That distinction matters,” Lujan said.
Bregman celebrated the endorsement in a statement. 
“I’m deeply honored by the trust Ohkay Owingeh has placed in me,” Bregman said. “For decades, I’ve stood alongside tribal governments in the fight for sovereignty and fairness. As governor, I will make sure tribal nations have a real partner in the Governor’s Office and a real voice in state government.”
Bregman also took to social media at the end of 2025 with what he called an “Obama-inspired favorites list” that included items such as his favorite musician and beer (Luke Combs and Coors).
What’s in a name
The Santa Fe County Clerk’s Office on Friday issued a news release reminding candidates of an approaching deadline for their own voter registrations. Once the Secretary of State issues the official election proclamation on Jan. 26, under state law anyone interested in running for office will be unable to make any changes to their names, addresses or political party affiliations. Those rules do not apply to anyone not running for office.

(Screenshot/YouTube, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman is no longer demanding a resignation from the chair of the state’s wildlife management board while the AG’s office analyzes a provision in state law that’s key to the dispute.
An earlier interpretation by the AG’s office has raised hackles among hunters and anglers across the state who say it runs afoul of how a license exemption for hunting or fishing on one’s own farmland has long been understood and enforced.
Sen. Gary Boswell (LRC Public Information)
The AG’s office is pausing its demand that Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission Chair Chuck Meade immediately resign after receiving a request from state Sen. Gary Boswell for an attorney general’s opinion, said Aaron Silletto, the AG’s executive director of the Office of Civil and Environmental Law, in a Jan. 8 letter to Meade’s attorney. 
Boswell, R-Owensboro, is asking if an exemption in state law that allows the “resident owner of farmlands” to hunt and fish on that land without having to buy a Kentucky hunting or fishing license only applies if someone lives on that farmland. 
“In light of this request, the office withdraws its request that your client resign immediately from his position on the Fish and Wildlife Resources Commission; we will revisit this matter after the publication of the Opinion of the Attorney General requested by Sen. Boswell,” Silletto wrote to Meade’s attorney. “We will be in touch with you regarding the opinion once it is published.” 
The Lantern previously reported Silletto in a December letter demanded Meade resign from the commission because he did not have the required five years worth of hunting and fishing licenses to be eligible to serve on the commission. Silletto wrote the resignation demand resulted from an investigation spurred by a citizen’s complaint the office received in October. Silletto did not name who filed the complaint.
Meade responded, citing the exemption for farmland owners and saying that he had met the legal requirements to serve on the commission by hunting on his family’s Lawrence County farm every year since 2008. Silletto responded that because he did not live on the farm, Meade did not qualify for the license exemption. 
Hunters and anglers say the exemption has historically meant one had to be a resident of Kentucky and own the farmland with no requirement to reside on the land.
Bill Repasky, an attorney for Meade, echoed that argument in a Dec. 31 letter addressed to Silletto responding to the resignation demand. Repasky wrote Silletto’s interpretation of the exemption was in “stark opposition to working knowledge held by our many public officials charged with enforcing Kentucky’s game and fish laws.” 
In a Friday statement to the Lantern, Repasky said the attorney general’s decision to “revisit his earlier position” was welcomed. 
“We are confident this controversy will be favorably resolved in the near future. In the interim, Chuck Meade looks forward to continuing his work as the representative of District 7 and to advocating for all the sportsmen and women of our commonwealth as chairman of the Kentucky Fish and Game Commission,” Repasky said. 
Commission members oversee the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources’s budget consisting of tens of millions of dollars in hunting and fishing license fees, boat registration fees and federal grants. The commission also implements and changes hunting and fishing regulations. 
State law also directs the commission to keep a “watchful eye” over the department, and the commission controls the employment of the department’s head executive, Commissioner Rich Storm. 
The concern among sportspeople
Jim Strader, the host of a Kentucky radio show about hunting and fishing, during an episode earlier this month said he’s been “flooded with calls” about the news of Silletto’s resignation demand and what the interpretation of the exemption in the letter could mean for hunters and anglers.
Jim Strader posing with a fish. (Provided)
Strader in a Lantern interview gave a hypothetical example of someone who builds a farm pond on their private property and pays to stock it with fish. The Kentucky Department of Fish and WIldlife Resources no longer stocks private recreational ponds. 
“Why should they have to buy a license?” Strader said, adding that he generally encourages people to purchase licenses to support wildlife management. 
The League of Kentucky Sportsmen, representing thousands of hunters across the state, in a late December press release called on the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources to clarify the interpretation of the license exemption because “tens of thousands of Kentucky sportsmen could be affected” by it. 
David Casey, the former assistant director of law enforcement at the Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, worked 24 years at the department and retired in 2009. 
He told the Lantern he recalls no instances of hunters or anglers being cited by game wardens for hunting and fishing on their own farmland without a license. 
“It’s always been in my time with the department, if you own the land and live in the state of Kentucky, you can hunt and fish on that property without a license,” Casey said. 
Casey said the farmland exemption did come into question if someone who lived outside of Kentucky was hunting or fishing on Kentucky farmland the person owned without a license. That out-of-state hunter or angler would thereby be violating state law because the person did not have a specific non-resident license. 
Casey believed Silletto’s interpretation of the exemption “would affect so many people.”  
“Everybody that lives in Louisville, Lexington, all the metropolitan areas, all your doctors and lawyers and professional people that own land that they have to hunt on probably don’t live on it,” Casey said. 
Casey said the way he understood the exemption, the department did not want to charge hunters and anglers a licensing fee for using private land they may also be managing for wildlife, timber and other resources.

Lisa Jackson, a spokesperson for the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, said in a Jan. 6 statement the department’s chief executive, Commissioner Rich Storm, “supports allowing bona fide resident owners of farmlands to hunt and fish on their own farmlands.” 
“Enforcement of the landowner exemption has likely varied over the decades. Establishing a definition of ‘resident owners of farmlands’ through legislative action could provide beneficial clarity,” Jackson said in her statement. “To those landowners who are not required by law to purchase a license or permit but choose to do so to support conservation efforts in Kentucky, Commissioner Storm extends his sincere thanks.” 
Jackson emphasized in her statement that wildlife is a “public trust for all citizens and is managed for the public benefit” and that the department is primarily funded through license and permit sales, alongside other fees and grants. 
Boswell in a Lantern interview on Friday said his request for a formal opinion from the attorney general has less to do with Meade’s standing on the commission and more to do with “whether thousands of hunters are violating the law.” 
Boswell said he would prefer hunters and anglers to voluntarily buy a license regardless.
“I don’t think the legislature wants to get involved in this issue. I don’t want to get involved in it. We might have to,” Boswell said. 
Boswell said he was hopeful the attorney general would “come to the same conclusion that I have had for the last 50 years of my life — that you do not have to have a hunting license to hunt on your own property.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-22-at-12.34.11-PM-1024x657.png,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota prosecutors are asking the public for evidence in the killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent on Wednesday after the Trump administration froze local law enforcement out of the investigation.
“Every moment in these cases is precious,” said Attorney General Keith Ellison at a news conference in Minneapolis on Friday. “If you have information bearing on the outcome of this matter in any way, please share it.”
The Attorney General’s Office and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office set up a portal for people to submit photos, videos and other evidence they think may help prosecutors understand the case and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will catalogue the submissions.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings and was on the scene at Portland Avenue near 34th Street collecting evidence after an ICE officer, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her Honda Pilot.
But on Thursday, the agency announced the U.S. Attorney’s Office had made the unusual decision that the FBI would be the sole investigative agency, effectively freezing out local law enforcement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” BCA superintendent Drew Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz and other state Democrats have expressed doubt that the public could trust the results of an investigation conducted solely by the federal government.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a Thursday news conference that local officials “have not been cut out. They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”
The standoff over jurisdiction adds to a contentious fight between state leaders and the Trump administration over fraud in state social service programs and a surge of thousands of federal agents and officers in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty emphasized that local officials have the authority to both investigate the shooting and potentially bring criminal charges based on the evidence.
“We do have jurisdiction,” Moriarty said. “We cannot make any decision, however, if there is not evidence submitted to our office.”
Moriarty said the FBI has possession of key evidence, including Good’s car and the shell casings from the officer’s gun. She also acknowledged they have really no access to federal law enforcement officers for interviews.
She said she does not have concerns about the integrity of the FBI, but rather that they won’t turn over their findings for state prosecutors to review.
“In the past, the FBI has invited us to see a high level overview of their investigation, but we were prohibited from seeing the entire investigation or talking about what we saw,” Moriarty said.
Prosecutions of federal law enforcement officers are also complicated by the fact that they have immunity from state prosecution for carrying out their duties.
But legal experts emphasize that immunity does not extend to officers who use unreasonable and excessive force.

The Department of Public Utilities, in its annual report to lawmakers on the state’s natural gas pipe system, found that the gas companies collectively spent $814.4 million to replace about 266 miles of leak-prone pipes. That’s by far the most the utilities ever spent since GSEP was created in 2014 and a nearly 40 percent increase in what was spent the year prior — despite the fact that the utilities replaced slightly fewer miles of leak-prone pipe than in 2023. 
“The [utilities] have spent more money per mile, with the progress at remediating leak-prone pipe occurring at a pace that is largely unchanged from when the GSEP program was first initiated,” DPU said in its report. 
The latest data on utilities’ work to replace leaky pipes, which emit the potent greenhouse gas of methane into the atmosphere, paints an even more damning picture of GSEP as costs balloon with few additional results — driving up ratepayer bills — and places recent reform efforts into greater context. 
“We’ve just seen an absolute explosion in the costs of this program, and it appears to be far beyond inflation,” said Kyle Murray, Massachusetts program director at Acadia Center, an environmental research and advocacy nonprofit. 
Massachusetts established GSEP in 2014 with the best of intentions: to create an incentive for utilities to quickly fix leaks across the state’s aging 21,000 miles of natural gas pipes and to provide Bay Staters who heat their homes and cook with gas a safer system and one that minimizes emissions.  
Since then, though, the program has been beset by runaway costs and contention over how the state squares the circle of justifying hundreds of millions of dollars each year in investments into a gas system that Massachusetts is at the same time trying to cut off — and rather quickly.  
The utilities have spent $6.2 billion on new gas pipes through GSEP, and spending through the program has increased by an average of 12 percent each year since 2015, according to the attorney general’s office, amid soaring material and labor costs. GSEP costs account for 8 to 11 percent of ratepayers’ monthly bills, the AG says. 
The DPU stepped in last year to make key changes to address the climbing costs, including cutting how much utilities can recover from ratepayers through GSEP and incentivizing repairing lines instead of replacing them.  
That DPU order came after negotiations over GSEP reforms proved to be a sticking point in the State House as lawmakers hammered out the 2024 climate bill. 
State officials project the DPU order will reduce bills as Beacon Hill seeks to lower the cost of energy in Massachusetts, home to the country’s third-highest residential electricity prices. Regulators launched an investigation late last year at the urging of Gov. Maura Healey to review all charges on gas and electric bills. 
Public outrage last winter over high ratepayer bills fueled Healey’s energy affordability bill currently under consideration in the Legislature. That has prompted fierce debate over what’s driven the rising costs, with some lawmakers even pushing to weaken the state’s 2030 climate commitments to halve greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels. 
The GSEP issues have exposed the tough choices facing Beacon Hill as it manages an energy transition: continue to spend money on an expensive gas system, spreading out the costs over fewer people as households switch to electric, or begin to retire the network of pipes altogether in favor of technologies like geothermal and electric heat pumps — the latter of which entails up-front costs but promises savings down the line. 
“If you do business as usual here, you’re going to keep throwing money at a system that is becoming antiquated,” Murray said. “And we’re going to stick an ever-declining ratebase with these costs, and then you are going to end up in an even greater affordability crisis. We’re going to be stuck with stranded assets if we don’t change the way we fundamentally do business here.” 
Total gas leaks in the state have been cut in half since 2014, according to DPU’s report, with just over 9,000 pending leaks at the end of 2024, a nearly 15 percent decrease from the year prior.  
But even then, the worst of the leaks, which require the most immediate action and represent an “existing or probable hazard,” increased from 37 to 40 from 2023 to 2024, as utilities battle the “Whack-a-Mole” of new leaks that emerge.  
National Grid, the utility that operates the most miles of natural gas pipes in the state, was responsible for all 40 of these leaks not yet fixed at the end of 2024.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CorrodedNaturalGasPipelineInspection-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

A ‘physical disturbance’ involving three incarcerated people occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Oshkosh Correctional Institution, Oshkosh police said in a statement. The department said it is investigating a death that occurred after the disturbance. 
Beth Hardtke, communications director for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, told the Examiner that Teng Vang, 43, died Thursday at a hospital. He was assigned to Oshkosh Correctional Institution. 
Police said a 43 year-old incarcerated person who assaulted another incarcerated person was secured by prison staff. He experienced a medical emergency and was transported to a local hospital. 
Hardtke wrote that the Oshkosh Police Department is investigating the death and the Department of Corrections is fully cooperating with the investigation.
Vang was found guilty of crimes including attempted first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree recklessly endangering safety. He was released on extended supervision in 2022, which was revoked in 2024.

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama appeals court ruled Friday that the state can license and regulate freestanding birth centers as hospitals.
In a unanimous opinion overturning a lower court ruling, Alabama Court of Civil Appeals Judge Terry Moore wrote that birthing centers were hospitals under state law and subject to regulation by the Alabama Department of Public Health. 
Moore wrote that the centers were delivering “obstetrical care . . . to the public generally” under a 1949 state law defining and governing hospitals.

“We do not believe that the legislature intended that only institutions utilizing obstetrics to treat pregnant women should be treated as ‘hospitals’ and be regulated by the ADPH while institutions providing alternative midwifery care, which implicates identical health and safety concerns, should not be considered ‘hospitals’ and should not be regulated by the ADPH,” Moore wrote. 
Oasis Family Birthing Center in Birmingham and Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville filed suit against ADPH in 2023, a few months after the agency adopted new regulations requiring centers to be under the oversight of a physician or medical director and to be within 30 minutes of a hospital with OB-GYN services. 
The centers, which provide an in-between option for individuals who do not feel comfortable with a home birth but prefer an out-of-hospital birth, said the regulations would make it difficult or impossible for them to provide services around the state, particularly in rural areas that lack hospitals.  
The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement Friday that the decision could lead to birth centers not being able to provide midwifery care in the state.
“Birth centers are needed here. Midwives and doulas are needed here. We are committed to continuing this fight on behalf of our clients and all Alabamians,” JaTaune Bosby-Gilchrist, ACLU of Alabama’s executive director, said in a statement.
The ACLU said it will seek “further court review” and that the birthing centers will continue to operate while that continues.
A message seeking comment from ADPH was left Friday afternoon.
Alabama has long struggled with higher-than-average infant mortality rates. According to ADPH, the state’s infant mortality rate was 7.1 babies per 1,000 live births in 2024. That was down from 7.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023, but still significantly higher than the national infant mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per 1,000 live births 
Infant mortality rates for Black Alabamians remain disproportionately high and racial disparities wide. According to the ADPH data, the infant mortality rate among white Alabamians was 5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. For Black Alabamians, the rate was 11.8 per 1,000. In 2023, the rates were 5.7 and 13.1 deaths per 1,000 births, respectively. 
Birth centers help bridge the gap for mothers in rural Alabama. Only 30% of the state’s rural hospitals have labor and delivery units, leaving many expectant parents to drive long distances for care. 
“We will continue to fight for pregnant Alabamians to be able to access high-quality midwifery care in birth centers without burdensome and unnecessary interference from the state,” Whitney White, staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement. “The essential care birth centers provide to Alabama families has never been more necessary than it is right now, with Alabama facing a serious maternal and infant health crisis that is disproportionately affecting Black Alabamians, those with low incomes, and rural communities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PXL_20230808_144437258-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 15:58:32.466950

(Maps data: Google, Airbus, CNES/Airbus, Landsat/Copernicus, Maxar Technologies)A buildup of hazardous gas at Alaska’s Red Dog mine in recent weeks forced the huge zinc and lead operation to fit workers with respirators and ramp up air monitoring at the mine and in nearby villages.
Since November, reactive ore and waste rock at the remote Northwest Alaska mine has been generating higher-than-usual amounts of sulfur dioxide — a colorless gas that, in high enough concentrations, can cause health problems.
The rock unearthed at Red Dog, one of the world’s largest zinc mines and a major employer in the region, has long generated low levels of sulfur dioxide. The gas, known as SO2, occurs naturally through a chemical reaction when minerals in Red Dog’s ore and waste rock come into contact with air.
But the emissions lately have increased because the mine has been digging up especially reactive rocks — and cold, calm weather has allowed the gas to settle over parts of the sprawling operation.
In recent weeks, sulfur dioxide drifted into mine buildings and reached levels high enough to fuel health concerns among mine employees and officials at the Indigenous-owned corporation that owns the land beneath the operation. Shareholders of the corporation, NANA, make up a significant portion of Red Dog’s workforce.
The mine’s operator, Vancouver-based Teck Resources, temporarily evacuated workers from certain areas, limited mineral production and has taken steps to drive emissions back down, according to correspondence obtained by Northern Journal. In the meantime, the company says it’s working to limit the number of workers on site.
“Many of you are concerned and frustrated and have questions regarding our…response to SO2 levels within the buildings,” a Teck supervisor said in a recent email to workers. “The leadership team takes the health and safety of our workforce seriously, including the SO2 challenges being faced.”
Teck has said that sulfur dioxide concentrations at the mine did not exceed federal health and safety standards and that, out of an abundance of caution, it has taken steps to mitigate risks and protect workers.
“Efforts to cool reactive areas and increased wind have resulted in a decline in SO2 levels in recent days,” Teck spokesperson Dale Steeves said in an email this week.
The company, he added, is working closely with federal regulators and NANA to monitor and reduce gas emissions and “ensure continued health and safety of our workforce.”
Teck does not anticipate a material impact on overall production at the mine, Steeves said.
“Red Dog is continuing to operate with appropriate health and safety measures in place,” he said.
The problems at Red Dog have played out under the radar for weeks, even as federal mine safety regulators investigated complaints.
The issue then emerged into public view earlier this month in an unusually blunt statement on social media from NANA, which has long worked closely with Teck. The Native corporation is owned by some 15,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to Northwest Alaska and receives a share of the mine’s profits.
“NANA is communicating our concerns, and the concerns of shareholders, to the operator and has been taking action within our role as the landowner to ensure those concerns are clearly conveyed and addressed,” the company said.

The statement came a day after Red Dog’s general manager — Teck employee Les Yesnik — sent NANA’s chief executive a memo laying out the situation. NANA then distributed the memo to its shareholders.
Red Dog’s main pit contains rock that’s reactive with oxygen and can “self-heat under certain environmental conditions,” Yesnik said in the memo, which was obtained by Northern Journal.
The chemical reaction between the rock and air naturally emits sulfur dioxide, which in low concentrations can cause irritation to the nose, eyes, throat and lungs and in high concentrations can cause permanent lung damage, Yesnik’s memo said.
Red Dog’s operations have generated the gas since the 1990s, but high iron levels in the ore that’s currently being processed and in the mine’s waste rock have recently created “hot spots” in the pit, Yesnik said.
Low temperatures and low winds have “allowed emissions to settle in lower-lying areas,” where some buildings are located — including where employees sleep and eat, according to the memo.
In response, Teck said, the company has adopted numerous measures to protect workers and reduce the emissions.
It has set up dozens of indoor and outdoor monitoring stations, installed new air filters and has used a water truck to cool the hot spots.
The company also has drafted plans to move reactive rock into a pit filled with water or to bury it beneath less reactive waste.
Teck has reduced production, too, though it needs to maintain some output to avoid damage from an equipment freeze-up in temperatures below minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, Yesnik said in the memo.
NANA declined to comment.
Sulfur dioxide emissions are a rarely discussed mining problem, but the issue at Red Dog is not unprecedented, said Dave Chambers, president of the Center for Science in Public Participation, a Montana-based nonprofit that analyzes the environmental impacts of mines.
Chambers said he’s heard of similar problems at other mines with deposits rich in sulfide minerals, though he wasn’t aware of an instance when the gas emissions were high enough to cause an air quality problem. Sulfur dioxide emissions are likely much higher from other sources at mines, like diesel generators, than they are from ore or waste rock, Chambers added.
Teck has been sharing SO2 data with regulators at the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, the company told employees.
That regulatory agency, part of the U.S. Department of Labor, investigated the complaints and concluded “negative findings” for each one, said labor department spokesperson Kristen Knebel.
Knebel did not immediately answer additional questions about MSHA’s actions and would not provide copies of the complaints. Northern Journal submitted a request for those records under the Freedom of Information Act; MSHA estimated the request would take one month to process.
State environmental regulators said they are monitoring the situation but only learned of it through an inquiry from Northern Journal.
Alaska’s regulations require companies to notify the Department of Environmental Conservation about releases of hazardous substances.
The department is coordinating with Teck to clarify reporting requirements “since it’s not a routine hazardous substance release, and we don’t encounter this type of situation very often,” Kimberley Maher, a regulator with the agency’s spill response program, said in an email to Northern Journal.

TPS provides a shield against deportation for people from counties in the middle of a humanitarian crises or armed conflict. Since regaining office a year ago, Trump has terminated or announced intent to terminate TPS for more than 1 million individuals, according to the American Immigration Council.
The Democrats addressed their letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Department  of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
In the case of Venezuela, Noem announced in January 2025 that the administration was ending the 18-month extension of TPS for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans that former President Joe Biden had implemented just 10 days days before he left the White House. The Biden White House had said that the extension was warranted “based on the severe humanitarian emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic crises under the inhumane Maduro regime.”
The letter sent on Friday to Rubio and Noem was signed by 70 congressional Democrats.
“Hundreds of thousands of lawful Venezuelan residents who benefited from TPS … are facing deportation in the coming weeks to instability, desperate poverty and danger — conditions that have become even more dangerous since President Trump ordered military strikes and special operations to remove dictator Nicolás Maduro,” the letter says. “Many Venezuelans are hiding out in their homes, terrified of follow-on strikes or harassment by the regime which remains in place.”
“The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved,” the letter adds. “This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now. This termination of lawful status has caused unimaginable fear and anxiety for law-abiding Venezuelan families, who passed criminal background checks, earned work permits, and paid fees and taxes.”
The Democrats go on to say in the letter that the Trump administration has “abandoned the Venezuelans that remain in Venezuela who yearn for freedom and a democratic transition,” noting how Maduro’s “criminal accomplices remain in power,” specifically mentioning interim president Delcy Rodriguez, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello (who was indicted on narco-terrorism charges alongside Maduro by the U.S. Justice Department in 2020).
“We are disturbed that the Administration has vocally backed these individuals, who are complicit in the worst abuses of the Venezuelan regime over the last decade, while dismissing the pro-democracy leadership of the legitimate president-elect, Edmundo González, and Nobel Peace Prize winning opposition leader María Corina Machado,” the Democrats write.

The Montana Cannabis and Alcohol Regulation Division (CARD) is offering its third annual opportunity for graduating high school seniors to apply for Alcohol Responsibility Matters scholarships.
Seniors who will attend a Montana college, apprentice program, or certificate institute are encouraged to apply for the scholarship, which includes coming up with a design and writing a brief paragraph dedicated to answering the question: “What does ‘Alcohol Responsibility Matters’ mean to you and your community?”
CARD will award five seniors a one-time, $2,000 scholarship.
The scholarship funds come from the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, which distributes alcohol education awards to state member organizations, including CARD, a division of the Department of Revenue.
Selected winners will have their original artwork designs used to promote responsible alcohol consumption across Montana. According to CARD, the artwork will have a consistent theme centered on Montana and the tagline “Alcohol Responsibility Matters,” and the existing logo, along with the student’s original artwork idea.
CARD hopes to provide community-centered messages reminding individuals 21 and over of the importance of being responsible when consuming alcohol and to support year-round alcohol awareness.
The scholarship is targeted toward high school seniors, knowing that while most are under the age of 21, moving forward in life to college, or post-secondary institutions without parent or guardians guidance, there may be increased pressure to drink.
According to the scholarship page, the requirements of the submissions include the artwork design and a 250-word paragraph explaining the design, which could be used for posters, t-shirts, stickers, decals and other marketing materials.
Students may draw something, create something in PowerPoint, Illustrator, Canva, InDesign, etc., and then (if chosen) CARD will take the design/idea and work to create artwork. Generative AI, such as ChatGPT or other similar applications for essays or artwork, will not be accepted.
The application deadline is January 25, and details about the application process can be found online at the scholarship website.
In 2025, the Department of Revenue announced it had selected five scholarship winners out of 55 submissions. The winning students were from Shepard, Libby, Bozeman, Cut Bank and Thompson Falls.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-1.png,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

The University of Delaware Fightin’ Blue Hens’ roster will welcome back a strong collection of talent from their first FBS season.
 
The NCAA football transfer portal opened on January 2, allowing players from programs across the country to look for a new home in the new year. According to ESPN, over 4,000 players entered their name into the transfer portal and only a week has gone by since the official window opened. Players will have until January 16, to enter their name into the transfer portal and even longer after that to officially choose a new place to play. 
The Blue Hens are no stranger to the advantages presented by the transfer portal. Last season, Delaware signed 12 transfers to their roster. The transfer class included the Blue Hens’ leader in receiving touchdowns — Kyre Duplessis — and defensive end Noah Matthews who finished with seven tackles for loss and two sacks. 
This offseason the Blue Hens have yet to sign any transfers, but they’re welcoming back many of their players from last year’s bowl game squad. In total, 19 players from last year’s roster announced their intent to remain with the program next season. Only two players announced their intention to depart.  
One of the first players to announce their intent to return was quarterback Nick Minicucci. The junior quarterback completed his season with multiple second place finishes in the Delaware record books trailing program legend, Joe Flacco, in completions for a season and total yards in a season. Minicucci threw for 3,683 yards and 23 touchdowns leading Conference USA’s top passing attack. His 283.31 passing yards per game landed him top ten in the nation.
In addition to Minicucci, wide receiver Sean Wilson announced via X he is returning to UD next season. Wilson finished as the Blue Hens top receiver with 68 catches and 877 receiving yards. Tight end Elijah Sessoms and running backs Jo Silver and Viron Ellison Jr. are returning to the program as well, bringing back over 1,500 yards of total offense combined from last season.
Three members of UD’s starting offensive line have announced they will be returning to the program. Anthony Caccese, Noah Rosahac and second-team all CUSA lineman Steven Demboski all announced their intent to return next season. The only member of the offensive line to announce they will not return to Newark, is starting left tackle Anwar O’Neal. 
O’Neal entered the portal before the holidays and announced via X on January 7, that he will be playing at Louisville next season. The only other Delaware player to enter the portal thus far is wide receiver Thomas Amankwaa, according to On3 and confirmed via an announcement on his X account. 
UD’s defense is benefiting from players deciding to stay just as much as the offense. 
Matthews announced he will be returning to the team next season along with fellow defensive end Brandon Gorham. Sophomore Trace Scott III announced that he will be staying with the program after ending the season tied for the team lead in sacks with three and half. CUSA’s third leading tackler, linebacker Gavin Moul, announced his return to the program via X and first-team all CUSA safety KT Seay did the same. The returning group is responsible for about 29 percent of Delaware’s total tackles last season.

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)A Maine superior court judge blocked the expansion of Maine’s largest landfill on Friday, siding with the Penobscot Nation and Boston-based environmental group Conservation Law Foundation.
Penobscot County Superior Court Judge Bruce Mallonee ruled against the Department of Environmental Protection, saying the department had not done adequate fact finding to determine that expanding Juniper Ridge Landfill, located near Old Town, would benefit the public, and did not consider the environmental impacts that the landfill has on the nearby Penobscot Nation.
“For generations, we have spoken about the many impacts our community fights against at once — on our health, our lands, and the Penobscot River, the oldest citizen of our Nation,” said Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis in a statement responding to the court’s decision. “This ruling affirms that those burdens must be taken seriously. We hope it signals a shift toward decisions that listen more closely to Indigenous voices and consider the full picture of the harm our communities face.”
Maine opens door for landfill expansion despite community objections

Juniper Ridge has long been a focus of the Tribe and neighboring community, members of which expressed concerns about air and water pollution. 
More than half of Maine’s landfill waste ends up at Juniper Ridge. It is owned by the state through the Bureau of General Services, which has an operating contract with NEWSME Landfill Operations, a subsidiary of waste management company Casella.
Expecting that it will reach capacity in 2028, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection determined in October 2024 that expanding the landfill would benefit the public, allowing Casella to apply for a license to expand the landfill. 
That license was approved by the department, and in November 2024, the environmental advocacy organization, along with the Penobscot Nation, appealed the department’s decision.
Last May, more than 50 people protested against the expansion, including residents of Old Town and the Penobscot Nation’s reservation at Indian Island, which includes portions of the Penobscot River and is located five miles downstream of the landfill.
Locals have argued that there has been insufficient treatment of landfill leachate — water that collects chemicals after passing through the waste — which runs into the Penobscot River. They are specifically concerned about per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS or forever chemicals, which are linked to a number of negative health effects like some cancers, high cholesterol, reproductive and fetal development issues, and more. 
Friday’s ruling prevents the expansion plan from moving forward under its current approval, which would have added space to handle the equivalent of 8.6 Empire State Buildings-worth of trash to the landfill, according to Conservation Law Foundation.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_6846-scaled-e1760632177850-1024x708.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223
,California,2026-01-09 19:44:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Newsom’s budget shows big revenue gain, but we’ve been  down that path before",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/newsoms-budget-revenue-gain-california/,The Newsom administration once overstated income by $165 billion over four years. Now Newsom has announced $42 billion in new revenues over three years.,"When Gov. Gavin Newsom declared today that the state will likely receive an extra $42.3 billion in tax revenue over the next three years, thus alleviating a stubborn budget deficit, the inimitable Yogi Berra’s famous observation came to mind.
“It’s like déjà vu all over again,” Berra quipped in 1961, after watching Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris, the New York Yankees’ star sluggers, hit back-to-back home runs.
Four years ago, as the state’s economy rebounded from a pandemic-caused downturn, the state’s revenues saw a brief upward spike. Someone in the administration, perhaps Newsom himself, decided that the revenue jump would be permanent and that it meant a $97.5 billion surplus over several years.
“No other state in American history has ever experienced a surplus as large as this,” Newsom bragged as he unveiled a 2022-23 fiscal year budget that topped $300 billion.
Newsom’s declaration touched off a spending spree that boosted outlays by $14 billion. But the revenues never reached the assumed level and his Department of Finance eventually — and very quietly — acknowledged that the administration had overstated income by a whopping $165 billion over four years.
The additional spending, which outpaced real revenues, created what was dubbed a “structural deficit” in the annual $20 billion range ever since, covered with an array of accounting gimmicks, spending deferrals and raids on special funds and emergency reserves.
A few weeks ago, the Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, projected an $18 billion deficit for the 2026-27 fiscal year, rising to $35 billion later.
The draft budget that Newsom’s finance director, Joe Stephenshaw, outlined today would increase outlays by $27 billion over the current year to $321 billion, including a $248.3 billion general fund, up $20 billion.
The revenue increase projection, which Newsom mentioned in Thursday’s State of the State address, would cover all but $2.9 billion of the new spending plan, Stephenshaw said.
Simply put, if the budget’s projected $42.3 billion revenue increase is real, Newsom can conclude his governorship —– and probably segue into a presidential campaign — with the state’s finances no longer plagued by deficits.
Balancing the budget would also bolster Newsom’s opposition to calls from the left-leaning legislators and activists in his own party for tax increases to cover the shortfall and President Donald Trump’s cuts in federal health and welfare support.
However, we saw the corrosive effects of overestimating revenues in 2022, so the new forecast should be viewed skeptically.
Newsom hedges his bets by portraying the budget as a placeholder that covers little more than spending increases driven by law, inflation and caseload until more revenue data is received.
“While the budget is balanced in the 2026-27 fiscal year, with a discretionary reserve of $4.5 billion, it projects a deficit of roughly $22 billion in the 2027-28 fiscal year and shortfalls in the two years following,” the draft declares. “The administration intends to build on this budget proposal in May with a revised plan — reflecting updated revenue and spending data — that balances the budget in both the 2026-27 and 2027-28 fiscal years with adequate budget reserves.”
Having been burned badly by his phantom surplus in 2022, Newsom is obviously aware that a repeat would be politically poisonous. His more cautious approach was symbolized by how the budget was presented.
In years past, Newsom would personally go through the budget, almost line-by-line, in presentations that sometimes lasted three hours. This time, he dispatched Stephenshaw to face reporters and characterize the budget as a draft that will be updated in May, as Newsom and the Legislature face a June 15 constitutional deadline for enactment.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010926-Budget-Presentation-FG-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

This whitetail deer had its glads removed during an FWP event on Wednesday, Nov. 13. (Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)Four new hunting districts across the state recorded a detection of Chronic Wasting Disease since July 2025, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks said Friday.
The four districts were in FWP regions 3, 4 and 6. Those regions cover the south west, north central and northeast parts of the state. 
The department announced since July, there were 433 positive Chronic Wasting Disease tests out of 8,574 tests to date, an increase from last year, though FWP said it was too early to make any authoritative call on potential new trends.
“Without this data, the risk of CWD going undetected increases, which can lead to significant, long-term declines in herd health and hunting opportunities,” a recent FWP release said. “Proactive management based on hunter-submitted data is the only way to help ensure Montana’s big game populations remain resilient for future generations.”
Of the positive results, 250 were white-tailed deer, 179 were mule deer, and four were elk. 
As a comparison, from July 1, 2024, to March 25, 2025, there were 356 positive CWD tests on slightly less than 10,000 samples, according to the 2024 CWD report, published by FWP. However, the department said it’s important to note high concentrations of animals were tested in areas already known to have CWD.
The data helps biologists track where the disease is moving and guide where the agency might take management action, such as an extended season on a particular animal and where to concentrate their sampling efforts.
“We use the proportion of positive CWD tests from adult hunter-harvested animals to calculate prevalence in each hunting district,” Jacobsen wrote. “To calculate prevalences, we use data from the last three years. We also look at new detections in hunting districts.”
From July to present, the agency processed 8,574 samples, with 428 of those returning a positive test. The fourth week of the season, Nov. 13-19, saw 1,741 samples collected — the highest sampling week ever for that period. The agency processed samples from 4,537 white-tailed deer, 3,047 mule deer, 944 elk and 46 moose.
FWP wasn’t ready to make any determinations on prevalence of the disease compared to last year, as they need to clean the data — a report on the 2025 hunting season and CWD is expected this summer. There are still active hunts on some animals as well, which could also influence the data.
“We would like to thank our hunters and local communities for your collaboration with our seasonal CWD staff who handled collecting and receiving their samples throughout the season,” Sam Treece, FWP’s wildlife CWD technician supervisor, said in a press release. “We are sincerely grateful each and every year for your contributions in aiding the wildlife heritage of Montana.”
On average, hunters received their tests back in an average of 7.6 days.
CWD is a neurological disease that elk, deer and moose can be infected with, and it’s neither a virus or bacteria. Instead, it’s a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy — a naturally occurring protein, called a prion, that is not broken down by the animal the way it should be. 
The disease can be spread through contact with feces and other bodily fluids. Importantly, soil that has been contaminated with any of those fluids can also infect other animals. CWD is always fatal to the creature, and animals can spread the disease long before they develop symptoms. 
There isn’t a cure for the disease, and there’s been no recorded transmission of CWD to a human. However, meat from CWD-positive animals should still never be eaten.
There are several ways to get animals tested — hunters can remove an animals lymph nodes and mail them in, or bring the head to any FWP regional office. The results of the test can be then found online.
About 30% of Montana’s hunting districts have CWD-positive animals, and the state has invested significant resources into tracking the disease for nearly three decades.
Extended hunting season
FWP also recently announced it was extending the season on white-tail deer hunting in some parts of southwestern Montana due to a rise in CWD cases there.
The extended season runs through Feb. 15, 2026, in all of Hunting District 309 and portions of HDs 301, 304, 311 and 312. Those are primarily along the Gallatin River corridor where white-tailed deer are most concentrated, FWP said in a press release. The goal of the hunt is to reduce the white-tailed population density.
The agency also reminded hunters to check the specific boundaries of the CWD hunt and that there are weapon restrictions in Hunting District 309.
“Reducing deer numbers in key areas is one of the most effective tools we have to slow the spread of CWD,” Region 3 wildlife manager Warren Hansen said in a press release. “Early action improves our ability to keep disease prevalence low, protect mule deer and elk from potential spillover, and maintain a healthier deer herd overall.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/FWP2-1024x688.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

But, it’s classified.
Federal regulators, and the U.S. Department of Justice attorneys representing them in court, offered little explanation for the abrupt suspension of five East Coast wind projects, including Revolution Wind, in court filings submitted Thursday. The tranche of documents, spanning 160 pages, defends the Interior Department’s Dec. 22 stop work order, which is being challenged by the Revolution Wind project developers, along with the companies behind three of the four other projects. The companies have each turned to federal courts to attempt to bar the Trump administration from interfering in their projects, claiming the 90-day suspension is an executive overreach that violates constitutional separation of powers, among other laws.
For the 65-turbine Revolution Wind project already 87% complete south of Rhode Island’s coastline, the late December halt to construction was especially harmful. The 704-megawatt project already endured a monthlong pause from August to September when federal regulators first sought to stop work under the guise of national security concerns. 
The initial stop work order was temporarily tossed by U.S. Senior Judge Royce Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Lamberth is scheduled to consider the second request for a preliminary injunction from the Revolution Wind developers, joined by the Rhode Island and Connecticut AGs, on Monday.
Ahead of the in-person hearing, Trump attorneys laid out their defense in writing to the court. They refuted allegations of constitutional breaches, and consequences for the project developers, who say they are at risk of losing $6 billion if construction cannot resume by Jan. 12.
The Trump administration’s response? 
“When it comes to the operation of the Project, the public interest in national security outweighs Revolution Wind’s alleged economic harms,” wrote Adam Gustafson, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the environment and natural resources division.










When it comes to the operation of the Project, the public interest in national security outweighs Revolution Wind’s alleged economic harms. 


– Statement by Adam Gustafson, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the environment and natural resources division, in court brief


But exactly what security concerns prompted the Trump administration to renege on the existing federal approval for the project remains fuzzy. The project had already undergone a rigorous and lengthy review of economic, environmental and security considerations.
Jacob Tyner, the Interior Department’s deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management, pointed to a November 2025 assessment completed by the Department of War, the new name the Trump administration has given the Department of Defense. The assessment itself is classified. 
But according to Tyner, “This information included, among other things, discussion of the rapid evolution of relevant adversarial technologies and the direct impacts to national security that arise from the operation of offshore wind projects in proximity to early warning monitoring systems, and military and civilian radar systems.”
The findings set off a chain reaction: Defense leaders met with federal wind energy regulators to update them on the new analysis. Energy regulators then wrote to Revolution Wind and developers of four other projects to call for a 90-day pause because they “had not considered the specific national security risks” in prior reviews of the projects, Tyner wrote.
This despite documented analysis, and agreement, over how the towering turbines spinning in Rhode Island sound might affect military surveillance and radar systems by the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) out of its operations center in Falmouth, Massachusetts.
A November 2024 agreement between the Department of Defense, the U.S. Air Force and the Revolution Wind developers outlined ways the parties agreed to mitigate potential radar concerns, including ongoing coordination and analysis of the acoustic monitoring equipment and fiber-optic cables used in the project constitution and operations. 
The agreement also called for the project developers to give $80,000 to the Defense Department within 10 days of completion for adverse effects from its project.
In exchange, the Defense Department agreed not to object or interfere with project construction and operation, as long as the developers’ remained in “material compliance.”
“As of the effective date of this agreement, Project Owner has disclosed to the DoD Parties in writing all material facts necessary for the DoD Parties to be able to fully assess the Project’s potential adverse impacts on military operations and readiness and risks to national security,” the agreement, signed Nov. 4 2024, states.
A second declaration from Dale Marks, deputy undersecretary of acquisition and sustainment for the Defense Department, might offer some clue what changed. But nearly all of the eight-page submission is redacted. A separate classified declaration — presumably without redactions — was submitted to the court for private review by the judge.
Burgum’s initial halt to construction set out a 90-day review timeline, though it acknowledged the possibility of extending the pause. But Tyner’s declaration hinted that a resolution may never come.
“At this time, BOEM is not aware whether the national security risks can be mitigated and, if they can, whether Developers would find the proposed mitigation measures acceptable,” Tyner wrote. “Further, any potential mitigation measures may be more effectively incorporated into the Revolution Wind Project before construction is completed.”
Also affected by the suspension order are Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind, both off New York’s coastline; Vineyard Wind 1, south of Martha’s Vineyard; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. Developers for Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind and the Virginia project have also filed separate federal lawsuits against the Trump administration seeking to resume their projects.

Free.,Landmark cases on transgender athletes at the US Supreme Court put trans rights on the line,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/landmark-cases-transgender-athletes-us-supreme-court-put-trans-rights-line,,"WASHINGTON — A pair of blockbuster cases to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court could carry far-reaching implications for transgender rights, even as the Trump administration during the past year has rolled out a broad anti-trans agenda targeting everything from sports to military service.The court on Jan. 13 will hear challenges to laws in Idaho and West Virginia banning transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports. Both cases center on whether the laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.The West Virginia case before the Supreme Court also questions whether the state’s law violates Title IX — a landmark federal civil rights law that bars schools that receive federal funding from practicing sex-based discrimination. Lower court rulings have temporarily blocked the states from implementing the bans, to varying extents, and Republican attorneys general in Idaho and West Virginia have asked the Supreme Court to intervene. “We know we have an uphill fight, and our hope is certainly that we prevail,” Joshua Block, senior counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBT & HIV Project, who will be presenting oral arguments in the West Virginia case, said at a Jan. 8 ACLU press briefing. “But we also hope that regardless of what happens, this case isn’t successfully used as a tool to undermine the rights of transgender folks more generally in areas far beyond just athletics.” The outcome of the oral arguments before a court dominated 6-3 by conservative justices will be closely watched. Nearly 30 states have laws that ban trans students' participation in sports consistent with their gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an independent think tank.Idaho case  The justices are taking up both cases in one day. First will be Little v. Hecox, which contests a 2020 Idaho law that categorically bans trans athletes from competing on women’s and girls’ sports teams. Lindsay Hecox sued over the ban in 2020, just months before the law was set to take effect. Though Hecox wanted to try out for the women’s track and cross-country teams at Boise State University, the Idaho law — the first of its kind in the nation — would have prevented her from doing so because she is transgender. A federal court in Idaho halted the law from taking effect later that year. A federal appeals court initially upheld the ruling in 2023 but later adjusted the scope of it in 2024 to only apply to Hecox, not other athletes. Idaho appealed to the Supreme Court in July 2024.Since that time, Hecox has asked both an Idaho federal court and the Supreme Court to drop the case. An Idaho federal judge in October rejected that attempt, but the Supreme Court deferred the request until after oral argument — meaning justices could still dismiss the case.“The Supreme Court is trying to decide whether Idaho can preserve women’s sports based on biological sex, or must female be redefined based on gender identity,” Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said at a Jan. 8 press briefing ahead of the oral arguments.“I think Idaho is just trying to protect fairness, safety and equal protection for girls and women in sports,” Labrador said at the briefing alongside West Virginia Attorney General John McCuskey, hosted by the conservative legal advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom.  West Virginia caseAfter the Idaho case, the justices will hear arguments in West Virginia v. B.P.J., which centers on a 2021 Mountain State law that also bans trans athletes from participating on women’s and girls’ sports teams. McCuskey argued that his state’s law “supports and bolsters the original intent and the continuing intent and purpose of Title IX.” McCuskey said the law complies with the Equal Protection Clause because it “treats all biological males and all biological females identically” and “doesn’t ban anyone from playing sports.” Becky Pepper-Jackson, who was 11 at the time, wanted to try out for the girls' cross-country team when starting middle school, but would have been prevented from doing so under the West Virginia law because she is transgender. Her mother sued on her behalf in 2021.A federal appeals court in 2024 barred West Virginia from enforcing the ban, prompting the state to ask the nation’s highest court to intervene.  White House, Congress zero in on trans athletesMeanwhile, President Donald Trump’s administration has taken steps at the federal level to prohibit trans athletes’ participation in women’s sports teams aligning with their gender identity. Trump signed an executive order in February 2025 that banned such participation and made it the policy of the United States to “rescind all funds from educational programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities, which results in the endangerment, humiliation, and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy.”The NCAA promptly changed its policy to comply with the order, limiting “competition in women’s sports to student-athletes assigned female at birth only.” In late 2024, prior to the policy shift, NCAA President Charlie Baker told Congress that of the more than half-million total athletes in NCAA schools, he knew of fewer than 10 who were transgender. The GOP-led House passed a measure in January 2025 that would bar transgender students from participating on women’s school sports teams consistent with their gender identity. But Senate Democrats in March blocked an attempt at imposing such a ban and codifying Trump’s executive order. Forty-eight GOP members of Congress argued in a September amicus brief supporting Idaho and West Virginia that “if allowed to stand, the interpretation of the lower courts will unsettle the very promises that Congress made to generations of young women and men through Title IX.” On the flip side, 130 congressional Democrats stood behind the two transgender athletes in a November amicus brief, noting that “categorical bans preventing transgender students from participating on sports teams consistent with their gender identity impose significant harm on all children — especially girls.” The group argued that such bans “do not meet the standards this Court has put in place to assess discrimination based on sex — whether as a matter of Title IX or under the Equal Protection Clause.” Trump’s broader anti-trans agenda has extended beyond athletic participation in the nearly one year since he took office. He signed executive orders that: make it the “policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female;” restrict access to gender-affirming care for kids; and aim to bar openly transgender service members from the U.S. military. ‘Textbook discrimination’ The Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group, has noted that there has been “considerable disinformation and misinformation about what the inclusion of transgender youth in sports entails” and that trans students’ sports participation “has been a non-issue.”In a statement ahead of oral arguments, HRC’s senior director of legal policy Cathryn Oakley said “every child, no matter their background, race, or gender, should have access to a quality education where they can feel safe to learn and grow — and for many kids that involves being a part of a school sports team.”Oakley added that “to deny transgender kids the chance to participate in school sports alongside their peers simply because of who they are is textbook discrimination — and it’s unconstitutional.”",,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

(Photo by Annice Lyn/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — In South Carolina, 16- and 17-year-olds can’t smoke, open a credit card or vote, but they can get married under a law some legislators and advocates are trying to change.
Until 2019, a loophole in state law allowed judges to issue marriage licenses to children of any age if they were pregnant or gave birth, allowing thousands to get married over the course of two decades. A law passed that year made clear that only those 16 and up could get married, with parental permission.
But as more states do away with underage marriage altogether, some are pushing South Carolina to set a firm floor of 18 years old.
Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto is trying again to get a bill he’s proposed during every two-year session since 2019 past the finish line. The proposal didn’t get a hearing during last year’s legislative session.
“I think that (marriage) is one of the biggest decisions anyone will ever make,” the Orangeburg Democrat said. “It should be done by someone whose mind is fully developed.”
Teenagers don’t magically wake up more mature on their 18th birthday than they were at 17, said Alex Goyette with Tahirih Justice Center, who advocates for bills raising the minimum marriage age.
But 18-year-olds have more opportunities than 17-year-olds. As someone who’s considered an adult by law, an 18-year-old can hire a lawyer and sign other legal documents on their own. Finding an apartment is easier, as is finding a full-time job, Goyette said.
“That’s really important for someone who is trying to resist an unwanted marriage or to leave an abusive situation,” he said.
Since Delaware became the first state to set a minimum age of 18 for marriage in 2018, 15 states have followed suit, according to the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit center, which works to protect women from violence and help victims. Five of those states did so within the past year.
South Carolina is one of 20 states that allows people as young as 16 to get married. Six states allow marriage as young as 15 or don’t have an age limit at all, according to the advocacy group.
The biggest challenge the advocacy group faces is time. Bills about their states’ legal marrying age generally aren’t among legislators’ top priorities, making it more difficult to get a hearing scheduled amid the frequent chaos of a part-year legislative session, Goyette said.
But the issue is an important one, with the potential for far-reaching impacts, he added.
Girls married before turning 18 are more likely to face domestic abuse than their counterparts, according to studies Tahirih Justice Center compiled. Marrying young often separates girls from support networks they might otherwise form through school, friends and family, making it more difficult for many to get help, Goyette said.
Underage brides are also less likely to finish high school or attend college, more likely to live in poverty, and more susceptible to long-term mental and physical health problems, according to the nonprofit.
“This, obviously, has devastating lifelong harms,” Goyette said.
Between 70% and 80% of marriages that include someone under the age of 18 end in divorce, the advocacy group found.
“These are not the foundational lifelong partnerships that we like to think of when we’re talking about a marriage,” Goyette said.
As more states raise the legal age for marriage, Goyette worries people may start traveling to South Carolina to take advantage of its comparatively lax laws about marrying underage, he said.
Some of South Carolina’s neighboring states have already approved stricter laws.
In Georgia, marriage is limited to those who are 18 and older. Tennessee and Florida both have age floors of 17. North Carolina also has a minimum marriage age of 16, but its law includes more safeguards, including allowing the other spouse to be no more than four years older and requiring a judge to evaluate whether the marriage “serves the best interest” of the person under 18.
South Carolina’s law does not include such safeguards that could prevent some unwanted marriages, Goyette said. As long as a minor’s parent signs off, any certified official can issue a 16-year-old a marriage license in the state.
“Until every state moves on this issue, kids across the United States are in danger,” Goyette said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/end-child-marriages-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:57:28.695223

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmaker Jared Storm of David City has asked the Legislature’s Executive Board to reprimand progressive lawmaker Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha for removing and later returning part of a Nebraska Capitol display on American history from conservative nonprofit PragerU.
Earlier this week, Cavanaugh said she removed the frames because “we are not allowed to adhere anything to walls in the hallway of the Capitol.” She said generally any such display would be placed near the information desk and not in the Capitol’s hallways.

“Such conduct is unbecoming of a member of the Nebraska Legislature…. elected officials should be held to a higher standard than members of the general public,” said Storm on the floor. 
Cavanaugh said she tried not to damage the artwork and called the Nebraska State Patrol to let them know where the paintings were. The patrol returned the posters to the Nebraska Capitol Commission, and the images were rehung. No “apparent damage” was done to the art. 
Storm, a Republican in the officially nonpartisan Legislature where the GOP holds a supermajority, said he thinks her actions ares a serious matter that needs to be addressed. 
“I think there are a lot of people in the state and nationwide that were upset to see those items pulled off the wall,” Storm told the Examiner. “They want to see some consequences.”

Cavanaugh declined to comment to the Examiner. She was seen talking to Storm and lawmakers on the floor as lawmakers worked on filing bills. She later said she apologized to lawmakers personally. 
Before lawmakers adjourned for the day Friday, Cavanaugh went to the mic on the floor and expressed remorse for what she did on the first day. 
“I should not have done [it] … I have regretted it pretty much ever since, and I regret putting all of my colleagues in the position to have to deal with the repercussions of my actions,” Cavanaugh said. “ I hope to do better. I appreciate the grace that you all have given me this morning in talking with me, and I hope that we can move forward in a productive way for the remainder of this session. I don’t want to be what stands between us and good policy for the people of Nebraska.”

The Executive Board met after lawmakers adjourned for the day. State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said the issues will be discussed in a closed meeting of the board but said Cavanaugh’s apologies were “sincere.”
Nebraska lawmakers are dealing with trying to close the state’s $471 million budget hole and weighing whether to expel a fellow lawmaker for the first time in state history, State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst. 
His expulsion hearing is set for Monday. 
Speaker John Arch of La Vista said the PragerU display is allowed in the Capitol with approval from the Nebraska Capitol Commission, which the exhibit had. 
The nonprofit behind the images has faced criticism for sharing content that historians consider misleading and inaccurate. The latest display is part of a push from the Trump administration’s White House Task Force 250, outreach designed to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota prosecutors are asking the public for evidence in the killing of a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent on Wednesday after the Trump administration froze local law enforcement out of the investigation.
“Every moment in these cases is precious,” said Attorney General Keith Ellison at a news conference in Minneapolis on Friday. “If you have information bearing on the outcome of this matter in any way, please share it.”
The Attorney General’s Office and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office set up a portal for people to submit photos, videos and other evidence they think may help prosecutors understand the case and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension will catalogue the submissions.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings and was on the scene at Portland Avenue near 34th Street collecting evidence after an ICE officer, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her Honda Pilot.
But on Thursday, the agency announced the U.S. Attorney’s Office had made the unusual decision that the FBI would be the sole investigative agency, effectively freezing out local law enforcement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” BCA superintendent Drew Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz and other state Democrats have expressed doubt that the public could trust the results of an investigation conducted solely by the federal government.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a Thursday news conference that local officials “have not been cut out. They don’t have any jurisdiction in this investigation.”
The standoff over jurisdiction adds to a contentious fight between state leaders and the Trump administration over fraud in state social service programs and a surge of thousands of federal agents and officers in what the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is calling its largest operation ever.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty emphasized that local officials have the authority to both investigate the shooting and potentially bring criminal charges based on the evidence.
“We do have jurisdiction,” Moriarty said. “We cannot make any decision, however, if there is not evidence submitted to our office.”
Moriarty said the FBI has possession of key evidence, including Good’s car and the shell casings from the officer’s gun. She also acknowledged they have really no access to federal law enforcement officers for interviews.
She said she does not have concerns about the integrity of the FBI, but rather that they won’t turn over their findings for state prosecutors to review.
“In the past, the FBI has invited us to see a high level overview of their investigation, but we were prohibited from seeing the entire investigation or talking about what we saw,” Moriarty said.
Prosecutions of federal law enforcement officers are also complicated by the fact that they have immunity from state prosecution for carrying out their duties.
But legal experts emphasize that immunity does not extend to officers who use unreasonable and excessive force.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_862-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 14:12:47.376567

Where does all this information about my legislators come from?
My Legislator is powered by the Digital Democracy database. It combines a variety of information and data from throughout state government that is publicly available but isolated and difficult to access. This database combines these related data sources so they can be compared to reveal relationships, patterns and aberrations in the Legislature and the policy-making process. 
The database includes four categories of information: transcripts, bill information, financial information and district data. Get a full breakdown on our Digital Democracy data sources and methodology page.
How are legislator rankings calculated?
We use standard competition (“1224”) ranking to determine legislators’ ranks. All legislators with the same value (e.g. number of bills passed) share the same rank, after which a gap is left in the ranking numbers. For example, if two legislators tie for the second-most bills passed, the ranks will be 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, and so on (skipping 3).
This means that if there are last-place ties, the lowest rank will not be 120, the total number of California legislators. Depending on how many people make up last-place ties, the lowest rank may be different across categories.  
How is legislator bipartisanship calculated?
Our bipartisanship scoring is based on bill authorship records. We count the number of instances in which a legislator of one party authors or co-authors a bill version with a member of another party. For example, if a Democrat legislator was the lead author for a bill version and Republican legislators are recorded as co-authors, then we consider that an instance of bipartisanship.
Lead authors are primarily responsible for the content of the bill and guiding it through the legislative process. Co-authors are legislators who, with the permission of the lead authors, add their name to the bill in a show of support for the bill; they are not usually responsible for the specific wording of the bill.
There are three combinations that we count as instances of bipartisanship:

Republican lead author(s) with Democrat lead author(s)
Republican lead author(s) with Democrat co-author(s)
Democrat lead author(s) with Republican co-author(s)

Each bill version that matches one of the three combinations counts as one instance, increasing the scores of all involved legislators by one. Then, we rank the legislators based on their final scores.
What are “noteworthy” votes of the week?
Lawmakers may cast hundreds of votes in a week, more than can reasonably fit into a newsletter. We use a range of metrics from Digital Democracy to assess which of your legislators’ votes to highlight, including: 

Bills with votes that diverge from any legislators’ past voting patterns
Intensity of discussions on bills, such as the number and length of back-and-forth debates between speakers
Number and influence of organizations taking positions on bills
Bills’ relevance to current news coverage or ongoing policy debates 
Amount of text added to and removed from bills
Overall number of speakers during legislative discussions

What do the bill statuses mean?
The PASS and FAIL statuses that we show in the newsletter indicate the vote results by a particular committee or chamber. 
A failed vote does not necessarily mean that the bill has died and cannot move forward. Committees can vote to reconsider a bill that they had not originally passed.
In order for a bill to get to the governor’s desk, the same version of the bill must pass both Senate and Assembly floors at least once.
Can I sign up for more than two legislators?
Right now, you can only sign for one state senator and one assemblymember per email address. If you’re interested in tracking more than two legislators, you can sign up for the newsletter using another email address.

Hoskins’ lawyer, Kathleen Hunker of the attorney general’s office, made the admission during a hearing in a court case challenging the ballot summary and said it would be revised in negotiations with sponsors of the referendum.
“On a further reflection of the ballot title, the secretary has come to believe that the language, though defensible, does come close enough to the line of being inherently argumentative and likely to create prejudice,” Hunker told Cole County Circuit Judge Brian Stumpe. “That means we can do better, and so we are going to withdraw our opposition to the plaintiff’s claim about how the language is inherently argumentative.”
A political action committee called People Not Politicians on Dec. 9 turned in more than 300,000 signatures to force a statewide vote on the redistricting plan Republicans muscled through a September special session. The PAC objected to the ballot summary as soon as it became public and filed a lawsuit on Nov. 20. 
Chuck Hatfield, attorney for People Not Politicians, told Stumpe that Hoskins will have to admit more — that the language he wrote is insufficient and unfair — to meet the standards for revising the summary.
“Your honor can’t enter an order just because it’s close to the line,” Hatfield said. “We’re going to have to have a finding that it’s insufficient and unfair. And I’m asking them to agree to that, and if they don’t, then we need a trial.”
The case before Stumpe was scheduled for a trial next Friday. He set a new date, Feb. 9, in case there is no agreement on what the revised summary should say.
Denny Hoskins isn’t verifying one-third of signatures for vote on Missouri’s gerrymandered map

The ballot summary written by Hoskins asks if voters approve the law, “which repeals Missouri’s existing gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbent politicians, and replaces it with new congressional boundaries that keep more cities and counties intact, are more compact, and better reflects statewide voting patterns?”
People Not Politicians objects to the characterization of the reapportionment made in 2022 as a “gerrymandered congressional plan that protects incumbents” and the factual basis for saying it keeps more cities and counties intact. The bill itself is just a list of voting districts and counties assigned to each district and the summary Hoskins wrote cannot be found in its contents, the PACs court filings state.
The summary’s statement about statewide voting patterns also brought objections. Recent elections gave Republicans about 60% of the vote and Democrats about 40%. The new map would give Democrats 12.5% of the state delegation instead of one-quarter.
Republicans want the new congressional map to please President Donald Trump, who demanded the changes as a means to protect the GOP’s slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. Republicans currently hold six of the eight seats.
If People Not Politicians and Hoskins’ office can agree on the factual basis for changing the summary, it would end the case but not litigation over the special session and the congressional map.
There are at least eight other lawsuits, six in state court and two in federal court, directly or indirectly related to the actions of the legislature or People Not Politicians.
The most recently filed case challenges assertions by Hoskins and Attorney General Catherine Hanaway that the map passed in September took effect on Dec. 11, 90 days after the end of the special session.
In that case, filed by the ACLU of Missouri, the state is accusing People Not Politicians and Hatfield of encouraging a lawsuit the PAC could not bring on its own. It has subpoenaed Hatfield, People Not Politicians Director Richard von Glahn and the PAC for records the state believes will show the connection.
“The state believes that PNP, Von Glahn or their agents recruited (the ACLU plaintiffs) as proxies to bring this lawsuit,” Solicitor General Louis Capozzi wrote in one filing in the case.
And the state is seeking sanctions against Hatfield in a federal case dismissed in early December that sought to block the petition drive entirely. In the federal filing, Capozzi argued that Hatfield admitted in federal court that the map would take effect even if signatures were submitted to force a vote.
“Yet during the following days, defendants and Mr. Hatfield personally have aggressively and repeatedly communicated the opposite position to the media, stating unambiguously that their mere act of submitting referendum signatures immediately froze (the redistricting law) and prevented it from going into effect,” Capozzi wrote.
In the Friday hearing before Stumpe, Hatfield noted that Capozzi is seeking sanctions and making accusations that he or People Not Politicians is sponsoring the case over when the map takes effect. The order from Stumpe directing Hoskins to revise the ballot summary needs to settle all legal issues in the case, he said.
“Mr. Capozzi sought sanctions against me in federal court, and he’s either confused about what happened in federal court, or he’s intentionally misrepresenting what happened in federal court,” Hatfield said. “I’m assuming he’s confused about what happened, and I don’t want any confusion here.”
There is also confusion over which of the more than 300,000 signatures will be checked to see if the referendum petition meets the threshold of approximately 110,000 signatures spread over six congressional districts. 
In court, and in media statements, Hoskins and his attorneys have said only signature pages with at least one signature dated Oct. 14 or later will be checked. Hoskins approved the form of the petition on Oct. 13.
Of the 49,773 pages with signatures, 33,068 have been sent to local election authorities to verify whether the signatures are from registered voters. The rest, Hoskins’ office said Friday in a statement to The Independent, “having invalid dates were scanned, retained, and organized separately.”
Speaking on KMOX radio on Wednesday morning, Hoskins repeated the statement that signatures aren’t being checked.
“We’re not counting those,” Hoskins said. “And, you know, unless a judge issues a court order and says, hey, yes, you must count these. But otherwise, we’ve set those aside. They should not count toward that referendum.“
But in statements to People Not Politicians, Chrissy Peters, Hoskins’ director of elections, said the pages retained in the secretary of state’s office are being checked for signature verification.
In a statement intended to clarify the confusion, Rachael Dunn, spokeswoman for Hoskins, said Friday that no signature checks are being made in Hoskins to determine if the petition has sufficient signatures to be placed on the ballot. 
She said only signatures on pages sent to local election authorities will be counted.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A new public opinion survey of 600 likely Republican primary voters shows Naples U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is running away with the 2026 Republican race for governor.
Donalds, who was elected to Florida’s 19th Congressional District in 2020, leads Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis — who has not declared a candidacy for governor — by “only” 13 points, 39%-26%, in a poll conducted by Fabrizio, Lee & Associates, a GOP political polling firm.
However, when voters are informed that Donalds has already been endorsed by President Donald Trump, his lead swells to 58 points, 68%-10%.
When GOP voters were asked how they would vote were the gubernatorial race held today, Donalds leads investment firm CEO James Fishback, 47%-5%. His lead leaps to 76%-6% over Fishback when voters are informed about the Trump endorsement. Former House Speaker Paul Renner gets 4%, but that number drops to 1% when informed about the Trump endorsement.
Lt. Gov. Jay Collins has discussed entering the race, but has yet to do so. The pollsters write that despite a high-profile series of television ads promoting him that aired in the last part of 2025, the needle hasn’t moved at all for the LG.
“Any sugar high from Jay Collins’ multimillion ad buy has completely dissipated,” they write. “Virtually no RPVs [Republican primary voters] recall seeing anything about Collins (only 16%) and Donalds crushes him in every ballot permutation.”
There have been no major polls of the Democratic primary race, which features former GOP U.S. Rep. David Jolly and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)After Idaho’s top election official gave the federal government a list of all Idaho registered voters that scrubbed their personal information, the U.S. Department of Justice says it wants the unredacted list.
The Justice Department offered Idaho a deal that would let the federal law enforcement agency audit the state’s voter rolls. And a Justice Department attorney hinted the agency could sue Idaho — like it has sued 23 other states — if election officials don’t turn over the full records that the Trump administration demanded. That’s according to communications in December that the Idaho Capital Sun obtained through a public records request.
Trump’s DOJ offers states confidential deal to remove voters flagged by feds

Since then, Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said his office and the Justice Department have been negotiating over whether and how to share Idaho’s full data — which he portrayed as a complex legal issue. He said he isn’t nervous that his office will be sued, but it could happen.
“Every indication to me is that we are having a good dialogue. And they seem to be willing, there’s a willingness with them to engage with us in that dialogue,” McGrane told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview Tuesday. “And so at the moment, I’m not nervous that we’re going to be sued, but it’s always a possibility.”
In September, the U.S. Justice Department asked states to turn over their full voter registration records — with identifiable information on registered voters. 
The Justice Department says it wants Idaho’s data to ensure election integrity. But as the Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement, some fear how the federal government will use the data. Trump has falsely claimed that droves of noncitizens vote, a crime which is actually rare nationally and in Idaho.  
The Justice Department did not directly respond to the Idaho Capital Sun’s questions about its negotiations with Idaho, or whether the agency would sue the state.
“Clean voter rolls and basic election safeguards are requisites for free, fair, and transparent elections,” Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon said in a statement. “The DOJ Civil Rights Division has a statutory mandate to enforce our federal voting rights laws, and ensuring the voting public’s confidence in the integrity of our elections is a top priority of this administration.”

 ‘You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week,’ Justice Department attorney tells Idaho official

After the Justice Department first asked for Idaho’s data, McGrane only gave the Justice Department access to a de-identified voter registration list, which the agency routinely shares with people and organizations that request it. 
“After consulting with the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, we will be sharing a copy of our publicly available file, which does not contain any personally identifiable information,” McGrane wrote to the Justice Department in a Sept. 22 letter. “We welcome a dialogue with your office to continue to discuss the broader efforts to ensure the accuracy of Idaho’s voter rolls.”

But more than a month later, the Justice Department re-upped its request for Idaho’s full voter rolls. 
On Dec. 4, David Vandenberg, an attorney in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, was calling to follow up on getting Idaho’s full voter registration list.
“You may have seen in the news that we have sued six states earlier this week for refusing to provide their voter registration lists,” Vandenberg said in a Dec. 4 voicemail to former Idaho Chief Deputy Secretary of State Robert McQuade. “And we’re preparing additional lawsuits. I’d like to keep everyone out of that as much as possible. But I haven’t heard anything back from you all.”
Days later, on Dec. 8, he sent an email to McQuade saying the Justice Department “is requiring an unredacted copy of Idaho’s statewide voter-registration list by Friday, December 12, 2025, as previously demanded.”
Less than an hour later, McQuade replied by detailing Idaho’s efforts to purge noncitizens from the state’s voter roll, which stemmed from a 2024 executive order by Gov. Brad Little. 
“After working closely with the Idaho Department of Transportation and using” a federal immigration database called SAVE, “we worked to verify citizenship for all of Idaho’s 1.1 million registered voters. Following this work, we provided data on approximately 30 individuals to the Idaho State Police (ISP) for investigation as possible non-citizen registrants/voters,” McQuade wrote. 
The number of suspected noncitizen voters in Idaho referred for prosecution was even smaller. 
“It’s our understanding that once the investigation was completed, around August or September of this year, ISP referred about a dozen or so folks to the U.S. Attorney’s Office here in Idaho for possible prosecution,” he added. “We have not heard where these investigations have led since.”
The Idaho Secretary of State’s Office is still verifying citizenship “on all newly registered voters prior to each election to ensure only citizens vote,” he added.    



 Idaho Department of Health and Welfare gave the feds fully identifiable data on SNAP enrolees

Months before the Justice Department sought state voter registration lists, the U.S. Department of Agriculture asked states for help to build a database for managing a food benefits program called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps.

USDA told states its request — stemming from an executive order in March by President Donald Trump that focused on stopping fraud, waste and abuse — was to build a database meant to “strengthen SNAP and government program integrity,” according to a July 9 letter USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins sent Idaho. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare gave USDA identifiable information, including enrollee’s names, addresses, birth days, Social Security numbers and eligibility information like income and expense data, agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun.
Like the Justice Department’s request for voter rolls, USDA’s request was a first for Idaho.
“This is the first time that USDA has asked for information on our entire caseload,” McWhorter said. 
Asked what the USDA has done with Idaho’s SNAP data, a USDA spokesperson who requested to not be named said: “We will not comment on pending litigation.”
 



 Why Idaho’s Secretary of State says sharing the state’s full voter roll is complicated

In an interview Tuesday, McGrane said his office has since been in talks with the Justice Department. The Idaho Secretary of State’s Office hasn’t shared more data or promised to yet, he said.
The Justice Department also in December offered Idaho a deal to share the data that would direct state election officials to remove voters deemed allegedly ineligible from the state’s voter registration roll. The Justice Department has offered similar, confidential deals to at least 11 other states, Stateline reported.

Idaho’s deal would allow the Justice Department to audit the state’s voter rolls, and would direct state election officials to purge alleged ineligible voters. McGrane said he hasn’t signed the deal. He said he hasn’t seen the Justice Department do this under any other presidential administration.
But he said he’s “very confident in Idaho’s processes for verifying voter information with very clean voter rolls.”
Part of Idaho’s talks with the Justice Department revolve around legal issues specific to Idaho around sharing voter lists, McGrane said. For one, because Idaho offers same-day voter registration on election days, the state is exempt from the National Voter Registration Act, which McGrane said is among the main authorities that the Justice Department has leveraged to get voter data from states. He said Idaho law also limits how the state shares voter lists with third-party entities, requiring certain security measures. 
In September, when McGrane only shared Idaho’s redacted voter list, he touted Idaho’s efforts to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. As part of that, his office already works with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to verify citizenship.
“It’s not as clear what DOJ’s intentions are at this point, other than saying they’re auditing all the states,” McGrane said. “And so we’re just making sure that we do that, and that any data that we would share with them is handled securely, and that it’s protecting voter information.”
In a statement last week, Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre said the Trump administration is prioritizing enforcing election laws.
“Enforcing the Nation’s elections laws is a priority in this administration and in the Civil Rights Division. Congress gave the Justice Department authority under” several federal laws, including the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act and the Civil Rights Act, “to ensure that states have proper voter registration procedures and programs to maintain clean voter rolls containing only eligible voters in federal elections,” she said. “The recent request by the Civil Rights Division for state voter rolls is pursuant to that statutory authority, and the responsive data is being screened for ineligible voter entries.”

La representación del profesorado en Cal State está muy rezagada respecto al creciente número de estudiantes latinos. Esto supone una carga para los pequeños círculos de profesorado latino que asumen más tareas de mentoría, muchas veces en puestos sin titularidad y con salarios más bajos.


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
En la última década, los latinos en el sistema de la Universidad Estatal de California no han representado más del 15% de todos los instructores, aun cuando representaron casi la mitad del cuerpo estudiantil en los últimos años.
Incluso en Cal State Los Ángeles, donde en 2024 un enorme 75% de su población estudiantil era latina, solo alrededor de una cuarta parte de su personal docente lo era, según datos de Cal State compilados por CalMatters. El número de estudiantes latinos ha crecido a un ritmo acelerado, y todos los 22 campus de Cal State, excepto unoEditSign , se han clasificado como Instituciones al Servicio de los Hispanos, lo que significa que al menos el 25% de los estudiantes universitarios de tiempo completo son latinos, y la mayoría son de bajos recursos. Algunos profesores latinos afirman que tienen un peso adicional, ya que son buscados desproporcionadamente por estudiantes latinos para mentoría. Esto también puede recaer sobre los profesores de tiempo parcial y completo, que constituyen la mayor parte del profesorado latino, pero tienen un salario más bajo, incluso aquellos que trabajan a tiempo completo y asumen tareas adicionales.
 “Cuando puedes ver a latinos que se parecen a ti, que tal vez tienen el mismo punto de partida, la misma experiencia de vida que tú, puedes ver lo que es posible”, dijo Feliza Ortiz-Licon, quien ha trabajado durante mucho tiempo con estudiantes universitarios de primera generación y ahora es vicepresidenta ejecutiva de la Campaña para la Oportunidad Universitaria, una organización sin fines de lucro de California que aboga por el acceso y la finalización equitativos de los estudios universitarios.
El profesorado afirma que las principales barreras para acceder a la docencia incluyen la escasa mentoría y la escasa promoción de los programas que les ayudan a obtener su doctorado. Además, estos programas ofrecen plazas limitadas. Las normas culturales subyacentes también han disuadido a generaciones de latinos de ingresar al mundo académico. Los campus de Cal State han continuado sus esfuerzos para diversificar el profesorado, por ejemplo, mediante la contratación por grupos o “clusters”, en la que se contrata a grupos de profesores por sus áreas de especialización y trayectorias específicas.
 Aun así, estos esfuerzos han hecho poco para aumentar el número de profesores latinos.
 Por ejemplo, en el otoño de 2024, Cal State contaba con 27,505 instructores, pero solo 4,079 eran latinos. Para alcanzar la paridad con el número de estudiantes latinos, el sistema habría necesitado 13,477 educadores latinos.


 ¿Por qué hay tan pocos latinos en la academia?
Amy Bentley-Smith, portavoz de Cal State, señala el bajo número de latinos que ingresan a programas de posgrado a nivel nacional. En 2023, los latinos representaban solo alrededor del 14% de los estudiantes de posgrado a nivel nacional, según un informe del Consejo de Escuelas de Posgrado.
 CalMatters intentó hablar con varios funcionarios de la Oficina del Canciller de Cal State, pero el portavoz indicó que no estaban disponibles para ser entrevistados para este artículo. En su lugar, Bentley-Smith envió la siguiente respuesta por correo electrónico: “Hemos sido líderes durante mucho tiempo en abrir puertas a las oportunidades y aumentar el acceso a la educación superior entre todos los californianos, incluidas las poblaciones históricamente subrepresentadas”, escribió Bentley-Smith. Agregó que Cal State supera consistentemente el porcentaje nacional de profesores hispanos, que representaron alrededor del 6% de todos los empleados a tiempo completo en 2023, según el Centro Nacional de Estadísticas de Educación.
Entre los pocos latinos con títulos avanzados, el 10 % ha obtenido un doctorado, según un análisis del Pew Research Center de los datos de la Encuesta sobre la Comunidad Estadounidense de 2021. Generalmente, se requiere una maestría para dar clases en Cal State, y un doctorado para un puesto de profesor titular. En sus investigaciones a lo largo de los años, la Campaña por la Oportunidad Universitaria ha atribuido el bajo nivel educativo de los latinos a las altas tasas de pobrezaEditSign , las presiones para trabajar y mantener a la familia y la falta de acceso a recursos e informaciónEditSign para acceder a la educación superior.

Y luego está el síndrome del impostor. Desde que empezó a trabajar como asesora académica en la facultad de negocios de Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Yesenia Márquez-Beas ha visto a innumerables estudiantes llegar a su puerta sintiéndose que no se merecen triunfar en el aula. Considera que esas dudas son mucho más comunes entre los estudiantes latinos que entre otros.
 “Quizás nuestra latinidad nos está frenando un poco para salir a buscar posiciones que vemos tan lejanas”, dijo Márquez-Beas.
 Progresar a través del ámbito académico hacia la docencia rara vez es parte de la conversación cuando se trata de caminos después de la graduación, dijo Márquez-Beas.
 Muchos latinos se rigen por ciertas normas culturales, señaló Ortiz-Licon, de la Campaña por la Oportunidad Universitaria. “No quiero molestar” es una de ellas. Este enfoque mantiene a los estudiantes reacios a buscar ayuda o mentores, dijo Ortiz-Licon, quien en su momento fue estudiante de primera generación.
 Anthonio Reyes, presidente del gobierno estudiantil de Cal State Bakersfield, estuvo de acuerdo en que muchos estudiantes latinos de primera generación tienen el “mal hábito” de no hablar sobre sus problemas. Después de la secundaria en Bakersfield, Reyes asistió a la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco, donde se sintió aislado e incapaz de buscar ayuda de sus profesores. “Eso es algo muy importante en la comunidad: uno no pide ayuda simplemente”, dijo Reyes.
 El segundo año de Reyes en la Universidad Estatal de San Francisco se vio interrumpido por la COVID-19, por lo que tuvo que regresar a casa y empezar a trabajar. Trabajó durante cuatro años antes de matricularse en Cal State Bakersfield para estudiar música, donde encontró un ambiente más acogedor.
 Es por eso que, como presidente del gobierno estudiantil, Reyes a menudo les dice a los líderes del campus que deben ser proactivos para ayudar a los estudiantes de primera generación. 
 El déficit crea un peso adicional sobre el profesorado latino
 Como los estudiantes tienden a buscar educadores con antecedentes similares, la brecha genera una mayor carga de trabajo para un pequeño grupo de instructores de color. Y los profesores podrían asumir esta tarea aunque no esté contemplada en su descripción de funciones.
 “Hay mucha carga cultural. Ese es el mayor problema de la falta de diversidad en la educación superior: el profesorado diverso asume más trabajo”, dijo Dirk Horn, profesor latino de ciencias políticas en Cal State Bakersfield. Esto también puede obstaculizar el apoyo a algunos aprendices, ansiosos por encontrar a alguien con quien puedan identificarse culturalmente.

 “He tenido como dos mentores latinos en total y estoy tratando de conectarme con otra, pero está muy ocupada”, dijo Isabella Cantu, una estudiante de doctorado latina que estudia sociología en UC Davis con la esperanza de unirse algún día a la facultad de Cal State.
 José Navarro, director del departamento de estudios étnicos de Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, creía cuando era estudiante que la educación podía ser transformadora, pero que cursar estudios superiores era como “entrar en una habitación muy, muy, muy oscura” en la que no podía transitar por sí solo.
 Como profesor titular, Navarro se desempeña como asesor académico y mentor, además de impartir docencia. Si bien a veces trabaja hasta altas horas de la noche o desde casa, Navarro lo considera más una necesidad que una carga.
 “Lo último que quiero es que algún estudiante de color entre, como me pasó a mí, en esa habitación completamente oscura que es el sistema universitario”, dijo Navarro.
 “El muerto entre muchos no pesa”, dijo Navarro. Dijo que así se siente en Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, donde la representación latina es limitada, pero el peso del servicio y la mentoría es más ligero cuando hay otros ahí para apoyar.
 Los latinos en Cal State tienen menos probabilidades de ocupar puestos con permanencia, que se espera que involucren asesoría académica e investigación. En otoño de 2024, los latinos representaban el 12% del profesorado con permanencia, mientras que los blancos representaban más de la mitad. Sin embargo, los blancos representaban el 20% de la población estudiantil de Cal State.
 Los profesores titulares influyen en decisiones importantes de la universidad, como la evaluación de la contratación y los ascensos del profesorado. Además, gozan de mayor estabilidad laboral, afirmó Navarro. Por otro lado, los profesores a tiempo completo cobran menos y tienen una mayor carga de trabajo docente.


Pero profesores como Horn mantienen sus puertas abiertas para sus alumnos voluntariamente.
 Horn colabora con el Senado Académico del campus, forma parte de comités y asesora a los clubes estudiantiles del campus, todo ello sin remuneración adicional. Sin posibilidad de titularidad, Horn también siente incertidumbre sobre su estabilidad laboral. Monitorea los presupuestos estatales y las tasas de matriculación para evaluar las probabilidades: en un déficit fiscal, ¿sería él el primero en ser despedido? 
 Lograr que más latinos ingresen al mundo académico
 “Creo que, más que nada, la mentoría es importante”, dijo Cantu, estudiante de UC Davis. “No solo ver la representación, sino sentir ese apoyo y tener a alguien que comprende tus antecedentes y tus orígenes”.
 Ella atribuye la mentoría que recibió de un programa nacional, la Beca de Pregrado Mellon Mays , por impulsarla a convertirse en profesora. Actualmente es becaria del Programa de Incentivos Doctorales del Rector, uno de los dos programas de Cal State que ayudan a los aspirantes a profesorado a obtener títulos avanzados.
Horn, profesor de Cal State Bakersfield, también participó en el programa de incentivos para el doctorado.Le proporcionó fondos para centrarse en los estudios mientras cursaba su doctorado en UC Irvine.
 Su camino hacia el doctorado fue accidentado. Su padre esperaba que Horn contribuyera económicamente a la familia, así que, en lugar de matricularse en la preparatoria, trabajó a tiempo completo mientras cursaba estudios secundarios para obtener su GED. Cinco años después de obtener su GED, cuando la salud de su padre se deterioraba, Horn se dio cuenta de que un título universitario podría brindarle a él y a su familia mayor estabilidad financiera. Asistió a un colegio comunitario y luego se transfirió a Cal State Bakersfield, donde encontró mentores que lo animaron a cursar estudios de posgrado.

 Horn pospuso su graduación para unirse al Programa de Logros Post-bachillerato Ronald E. McNair , financiado con fondos federales, que ayuda a preparar a estudiantes de primera generación y subrepresentados para estudios de posgrado.
 De los 35 estudiantes aceptados en el programa de incentivos de doctorado de Cal State este año académico, el 54 % son latinos, el 24 % asiáticos, el 19 % blancos y el 3 % afroamericanos, según Bentley-Smith. El programa ofrece mentoría, acceso a becas y premios financieros por miles de dólares, así como oportunidades profesionales para estudiantes que cursan un doctorado. También pueden recibir un préstamo opcional que se condona si el becario es profesor en Cal State. De los becarios anteriores del programa, el 69 % obtuvo puestos docentes en los campus de Cal State después de obtener su doctorado. 
Las contrataciones en grupo ayudan a impulsar la diversidad, cuando hay financiamiento
Algunos campus de Cal State, como Bakersfield y San Luis Obispo , han implementado la contratación por grupos (clúster) para fomentar la diversidad del profesorado. El proceso implica reclutar grupos completos de profesores con diversas experiencias y trayectorias. Ortiz-Licon, investigadora de educación superior, argumenta que esta contratación “en comunidad” aumenta el sentido de pertenencia a sus respectivos campus y fortalece la retención de estos educadores a largo plazo.
 En otoño, Sacramento State implementó su primera contratación de personal en un grupo de estudiantes, dirigida directamente a apoyar a los estudiantes latinos . Ese semestre, el 37 % de los estudiantes eran latinos, mientras que el 10 % del profesorado lo era, según la base de datos de investigación institucional de la universidad.
 Rebecca Cameron, vicerrectora interina para el éxito del profesorado en Sacramento State, dijo que la universidad buscó profesores con experiencia en tutoría, enseñanza e investigación de poblaciones latinas.
 Si bien Sacramento State contrató a 10 profesores de varios departamentos, Cameron dijo que dos de los nuevos contratados para puestos de titularidad anteriormente ocupaban puestos de profesores en la universidad.
 Cameron enfatizó la necesidad de retener a los nuevos empleados del grupo ya que a veces ha observado que los profesores que son los primeros de un grupo particular en un departamento pueden agotarse.
 “También sigue siendo muy importante que no dejemos el trabajo de inclusión [exclusivamente] en manos de personas que han identificado un interés específico en él”, dijo Cameron.

(New Bedford Light photos)This story first appeared in The New Bedford Light. Read the original version here.
When the first turbine pieces for Vineyard Wind inched into port in 2023, cranes and union labor stood at the quayside of a nearby terminal, ready and waiting to get to work. In the more than two years since, the project has kept the state-owned New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal busy and funded through a multimillion dollar lease.
But the 26-acre site wasn’t always bustling.
Eight years before Vineyard Wind entered the scene, the state finished construction on the $113 million terminal, purpose-built to support offshore wind, a buzzy industry that hadn’t yet landed. The site expected to welcome Cape Wind as the first tenant around 2015, but the Nantucket Sound project fell through after opposition. The taxpayer-funded site remained underutilized for years, and was left to find new, and smaller, revenue streams.
Amid the Trump administration’s offshore wind crackdown, it will soon find itself in a similar predicament. As the final Vineyard Wind blades trickle out, two questions emerge: What now for the offshore wind terminal, and what now for New Bedford — a city that courted millions in investment and built out its port to support an industry that’s facing an existential threat?
In a best-case scenario, experts predict construction in Massachusetts will stall for the remaining years of the Trump administration. But the worst-case scenario: the uncertainty imposed by the Trump administration in these last 12 months may be too challenging for a future pro-wind administration to overcome, freezing development longer-term.
For those on the New Bedford waterfront, their concerns are tempered with optimism. It’s a long game, and they’ve begun laying the groundwork to pivot their businesses for a few years until the next wave comes.
Still, “if the president that follows [Trump] is as hostile as he is, then we may be looking at a much longer term problem,” said New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell.
 What’s next at the Marine Commerce Terminal and Foss Terminal?

The Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, a quasi-state agency that owns and operates the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal, is currently undertaking a $45-million expansion of the site to support the larger and heavier “next generation” turbine components. It includes the addition of a few acres.
As that work has been underway, the site has largely emptied out with 61 of Vineyard Wind’s 62 turbines now towering above the Atlantic. The project’s lease with the terminal expires in June.
Before President Donald Trump was re-elected, MassCEC expected some lull at the site before the next project, which is supposed to be SouthCoast Wind. But the lull has had two years added to it, while SouthCoast Wind finds itself under increasing threat.

Bruce Carlisle, MassCEC’s managing director of offshore wind, wouldn’t provide much detail on the agency’s plans for the intervening years at the New Bedford site, stating staff have started to “put out feelers with interested parties.”
But Mitchell wants to know.
“There is going to be an extended period between projects. [MassCEC has] to figure out how to manage the in-between,” he said. “What we don’t want to see there in the interim is scrap metal or … other bottom of the barrel materials.”
Before Vineyard Wind, the terminal hosted land-based wind turbines, offshore wind research and survey vessels, recycled steel, ferry parking, modular building components, shipping containers, and timber piles. The terminal’s revenue was also millions less before Vineyard Wind arrived.
Just a minute or two drive north of the terminal is another wind site, the New Bedford Foss Marine Terminal — a private investment that remains under construction.
More than four years ago, city and state officials gathered at the then-abandoned power station to announce the site would take on new life to support a new generation of energy: wind.
Since 2024, the terminal has berthed offshore wind support and research vessels for Vineyard Wind and other projects. But it has become a bellwether of the industry’s stalling.
The original deed required the site to commit to exclusive use for renewable energy projects. But in October, Foss and city officials amended their agreement so the site may support transportation projects and storage of breakbulk (cargo too big to fit into a container).
The new agreement also temporarily allows the Seastreak Ferry to dock at the Foss terminal while it’s displaced from the closure of the State Pier. It allows parking for ferry customers — activities that have not been part of the terminal’s mission.
“We see there will be a lull,” said Andrew Saunders, president of the Foss terminal. “We see we need to adapt to what the market is.” He stressed their preferred market is “always the offshore wind market.”
If the next generation of wind projects was moving forward now, Saunders said he’d be in front of the city’s planning board to secure approval to build the terminal’s third phase: two 30,000-square-foot warehouses for wind developers.
But without power purchase agreements between the developers and utilities, the money won’t flow.

Mitchell wants New Bedford to be competitive with ports not just outside Massachusetts, but in it. So despite the hits to the offshore wind industry, he sees a possible opportunity for New Bedford amid some of the federal actions.
He’s talking about the Salem terminal, a public-private partnership between MassCEC, the City of Salem and Crowley (a maritime logistics company) that’s been in development since 2022 to support what was then a steady pipeline of projects to be built off the commonwealth’s coast and the Gulf of Maine.

That pipeline has since frozen, and the proposed terminal — on the site of a former coal plant — had $34 million in federal funding terminated this summer. (That funding amounts to about 10% of the project’s budget, per the City of Salem.)
Carlisle said the federal backing was a “critical part” of the funding mix. Salem Mayor Dominick Pangallo in November said it alone is “not entirely fatal” to the project’s completion.
Mitchell asked whether it makes sense for the state to have two staging terminals, stating New Bedford’s will be available when the industry picks back up.
“It’s no secret we in New Bedford have long been concerned about the possibility of the proposed facility in Salem competing against New Bedford,” he said. “The state has to explain why it would, at this point in the game, allow that project to proceed, given there aren’t offshore wind projects that might use New Bedford for the foreseeable future.”
But MassCEC believes the future market — as well as plans for floating wind turbines in the Gulf of Maine — warrants a second marshaling site.
“We’re taking … the medium and the long view,” said Carlisle. “We are positioning ourselves for when this industry gets some traction again.”
Because the floating turbines in the Gulf of Maine will involve different technology, Carlisle said, the state needs a different port infrastructure to support it.
Pangallo, like Mitchell, is bullish on the industry’s long-term future — and his city playing a lead role in its buildout: “The horizon we see … is over decades, not just the next couple of years.”
Pangallo said the parties are exploring a phased buildout or possible redesign of the terminal to deal with the funding loss. He said they’re also exploring “other temporary alternative uses that could support the port’s operation in the interim.”
In other words, Salem’s future terminal is already facing a predicament similar to New Bedford’s after Cape Wind fell through.
Further complicating the terminal’s future plans: its anchor tenant, New England Wind, has been targeted by the Trump administration. The federal government has asked a court for the ability to reconsider its approval of the project’s construction plan —  a permit necessary for buildout.
MassCEC in 2024 said the Salem site was expected to be operational by 2026. Not much work has progressed beyond a symbolic groundbreaking in the summer of 2024. Carlisle said he could not comment on the expected commercial operation date.
“The actions by the Trump administration certainly have led to more uncertainty on the part of developers and their ability to commit to leases, and that has impacted the long-term revenue and financing visibility for Salem,” Carlisle said. “But we are actively working with Crowley and the City of Salem as we speak on plans.”
Yearslong pause ahead
In the short to medium term, there will be “quieter times” at the ports that support offshore wind, said Kris Ohleth, director at the Special Initiative on Offshore Wind, a Delaware-based nonprofit.
“I think market and investor confidence is pretty much as low as it can possibly be,” she said, saying developers are contemplating submitting permitting documents near the end of Trump’s term — three years away.
“I would venture that the ones that started construction last year have been living in a perpetual state of fear and potentially regret that they did start,” Ohleth continued. “I can’t imagine any developer risking capital investment in this environment.”
The developers’ fears are reasonable. Two have seen their projects paused twice, costing millions in losses per day. And in December, all five projects under construction along the Atlantic coast were suspended, with the federal government citing national security concerns.
Timothy Fox, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, believes a longer term freeze is in the realm of possibility.
“The question is… will we see the industry ramp back up after Trump leaves office?” said Fox. “Our new best-case scenario for long-term offshore wind is that this is a pause. But we’re not convinced it is. We think the administration has sought to inject so much uncertainty into the industry that there’s not going to be a lot of interest among investors and financiers.”
Because the permitting timelines are lengthy and often span two presidencies, developers have experienced pendulum swings in the approaches of Democrat and Republican administrations. This last swing has been so extreme that it could have more lasting impacts, experts say.
 New Bedford jobs on ice

Though offshore wind is touted as a clean energy alternative, Mitchell sees the industry’s role and impact in New Bedford as an economic one. And with no project to follow once Vineyard Wind concludes its high-capital construction phase, that economic spout is expected to reduce to a trickle.
Mitchell said it concerns him, but he emphasized New Bedford never was, and never will be, a wind-only port.
“New Bedford is still primarily a fishing port. … That said, the recent contribution of marshaling of the Vineyard Wind project is a not insignificant contributor to the port’s total economic output,” he said. “It’s created jobs, opportunities for small businesses in the city.”

SouthCoast Wind and New England Wind, the two projects planned next for Massachusetts, face threats of having their federal permits and approvals revoked. They missed another deadline to secure power purchase agreements with the state utilities.
Each project promises about 100 jobs for the city, Mitchell previously estimated, including union labor.
Andy Benedetto, business representative at Local 1121, which includes carpenters and millwrights, said the union was in planning talks with SouthCoast Wind on what training and standards worked best.
But in late 2025, the point person for the wind project was laid off, he said, something that’s been happening across the offshore wind industry.
“We invested millions into training people and building this workforce that now is just going to be more or less stagnant,” Benedetto said.
The National Offshore Wind Institute, a Bristol Community College site that opened in 2024 to train the union workforce and other industry members, is looking to pivot, like its waterfront neighbors.
Brianne McDonough, interim vice president for economic and business development at Bristol Community College, in an interview this fall said the school “designed the use of the building around wind,” but that it can train different industries, including oil, gas, and construction.
Some smaller-scale wind work may continue in the coming years out of New Bedford. That includes possible operations and maintenance work, and fishermen providing site and safety security for turbine installation or subsea cable laying.
Tony Alvernaz, a New Bedford scalloper, made it clear that he supports the Trump administration and opposes wind turbines being installed around fishing grounds. But, he’s also appreciative of the work he’s found with the industry.
Alvernaz, who has worked for Vineyard Wind for at least two years, recently secured another contract with a subcontractor on Orsted’s Sunrise Wind project. His fishing boat will guard a bigger vessel as it lays cable. The job was set to start in February, but that’s unclear now that the project is suspended.
“I won’t say I’m grateful for [offshore wind],” Alvernaz said. “I’m grateful for the work I guess. Who knows where I would’ve been without this extra work.”
e’s glad to see a slowdown as it will allow research to catch up: “Now you get to see these guys fully permitted finish their projects… the pros and cons will come out in the next few years.”
Mitchell shared similar sentiments, saying the Trump administration’s revisiting and reconsideration of some lease siting with more weight given to fishing interests was necessary.
The speed at which the wind industry was taking off under the Biden administration, and even before, often sparked analogies about those involved building the ship as they’re sailing it. Now that it’s slowing — if not stopping — Ohleth offered a variation.
“For a decade, our favorite expression in offshore wind was building a plane while we’re flying it. Now the plane is on the ground. That’s an opportunity,” she said. “Figure out how to get the right policies, procedures and regulations in place that enable offshore wind to be able to flourish in the next political cycle.”
In the real, not metaphorical sense, the giant vessels associated with offshore wind won’t be sidelined. The foreign jack-up ships and retrofitted barges are in high demand and will return to Europe or the south to support other projects and industries.
But the local workforce, shoreside companies, terminals and smaller fishing boats that have built offshore wind into their business plans will need to pivot.
For how long remains an open question.

Kevin Stitt speaks in the school library of Eisenhower International School in Tulsa on Oct. 2. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Gov. Kevin Stitt is expected to advocate again this year for eliminating the cap on how much Oklahoma can spend to help children attend private schools, though the state hasn’t hit its current limit.
With the 2026 legislative session set to begin Feb. 2, Stitt remains committed to removing the $250 million spending cap on the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, his press secretary Tevis Hillis told Oklahoma Voice. The tax credits provide $5,000 to $7,500 to families to offset the cost of private school tuition and fees.
“Demand far exceeds current funding, leaving families on waitlists,” Hillis said. “His goal is simple: let more kids attend the school of their parents’ choice.”
However, the Oklahoma Tax Commission confirmed to Oklahoma Voice it hasn’t had to turn away any applicants this school year because of the budget limit. 
The Tax Commission reported last week that nearly $1 million in tax credits were still available for the 2025-26 school year with under two weeks left before the application window closes. Families have been able to apply since Feb. 18 of last year, according to the commission’s website.
When asked for clarification, Hillis said her reference to waitlists “pertains to students seeking those schooling options.”
The Oklahoma Legislature would have to agree to adjust the program’s spending cap, but lawmakers didn’t give even a committee hearing to a Senate bill last year that sought to remove the limit entirely. State officials estimated the policy would cost the state $13 million.
The state Senate’s top leader has continued to express reservations about uncapping the program.
“Any changes must be done responsibly,” Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said in a statement this week. “Removing the cap entirely at this time could lead to unintended consequences and strain the state’s ability to ensure the program is meeting its intended purpose. Our priority is making sure those who need help the most are the primary beneficiaries.”

House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, didn’t return a request for comment.
The state is projected to have $692 million less to spend than the year before, raising doubts about the feasibility of major new investments.
Stitt first advocated for eliminating the maximum spending limit on the Parental Choice Tax Credits in his state budget proposal last year. In a recent guest column in The Oklahoman, the governor pledged he would work this year to make the tax credits available to more families.
So far, only one new bill has been filed that would expand the program. Senate Bill 1389 from Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, would allow the spending limit to increase by 20% if at least 90% of the available funds are claimed.
Daniels filed last year’s bill to completely remove the spending cap. She said her new legislation is a “much more fiscally conservative, responsible way to go.”
“My bill this year allows us to grow the program in a responsible, measured way because we now see that it is very successful, and more Oklahoma families are choosing to take advantage of it,” Daniels said. “We should allow that credit limit to increase gradually as participation increases.”

Stitt and Republican lawmakers have celebrated the Parental Choice Tax Credit program, created in 2023, as a way to help financially disadvantaged families leave public schools and access the private school of their choice. 
Legislative Democrats have long criticized the policy for giving funds to wealthy families and for diverting millions of dollars that they say should instead go to public schools, which educate the vast majority of Oklahoma students.
Last week’s report from the Tax Commission shows the state so far has spent $249 million this school year on tax credits for 39,485 students. Just over 3,700 of those students had attended a public school the semester before the 2025-26 academic year, according to the report.
Students who qualified for the $7,500 maximum tax credit made up the largest share, 28.4%, of awarded applicants, according to an Oklahoma Voice analysis. These are children from households that earn no more than $75,000 a year or receive income-based government benefits like SNAP and Medicaid.
The state spent $79.6 million on private school tax credits for these students. 
The second-most-awarded group of applications, 27.3%, came from families with a yearly income between $75,001 and $150,000. These households, which qualify for $7,000 per student, collectively received more than $72 million from the program.
Households earning over $250,000 a year were the third-most common, representing 24.5% of total recipients. Oklahoma spent $48 million this school year to support the private school costs of these families, who qualify for $5,000 per student.

First Lady Casey DeSantis said the state tested 24 infant formulas and found that 16 contained heavy metal or chemicals. The samples were obtained through a variety of means, including ordering online, to make sure that it was “not a one-off shipment.”
The state has placed the testing results on a website called exposingfoodtoxins.com and those results show that the heavy metals included mercury, arsenic, lead, and cadmium. The brands tested include several manufactured by national industry leaders.
Infant formulas are not regulated by the state, but Casey DeSantis said it is important Florida and other states do independent testing to “drive accountability.”
“Parents should not be expected to verify the integrity of products on their own,” she said.

The push by Florida to test infant formula comes several months after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the Food and Drug Administration to look at ingredients used in infant formula. Before he joined the administration of President Donald Trump, Kennedy promised to look at whether there were toxic metals in infant formula.
The first lady discussed the infant formula testing during an event in Bartow that also featured Gov. Ron DeSantis and State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo.
In his remarks, Ladapo contended the results produced an “understatement of the risk” because infants can be subject to greater harm given their size, weight, and developmental stage.
He added that, of the items tested, “mercury is probably one of the most toxic things you can put in a person’s body.”
Gov. DeSantis only briefly touched on the infant formula testing results, but called the effort part of Florida’s efforts to bring “transparency” to medicine and food. He did briefly repeat his support for a bill that would bar physicians from refusing to treat someone if that person has refused to get vaccinated.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/infant_john-moore_getty-images.jpg,,,2026-01-09 13:59:16.766680

Un juez de inmigración concedió la libertad bajo fianza a Idris Demirtas, pero eso no fue suficiente para reunirlo con su esposa en San Diego. 


This article is also available in English. Read it here.
Un inmigrante turco que huyó de su país después de ser torturado ahora está en casa con su esposa en San Diego después de haber estado detenido durante aproximadamente siete semanas por las autoridades estadounidenses.
 Idris Demirtas , de 25 años, fue liberado solo después de que una jueza federal del Distrito Sur de California concediera un recurso de hábeas corpus, al determinar que su detención era injustificada. Una jueza de inmigración emitió un fallo a favor de Demirtas una semana antes, pero supeditó el fallo a un proceso judicial federal.
 Su arresto en un control migratorio rutinario y su detención durante 48 días reflejaron algunas de las tácticas de aplicación de la línea dura de la administración Trump desde que el republicano asumió el cargo hace un año y se comprometió a deportar a un millón de personas por año.
“Crecí mucho en este proceso, pero perdimos mucho emocional y mentalmente”, dijo Mae Bovenzi, la esposa de Demirtas. “Espero que nuestra salud mental se normalice. Siento que nos han desinformado mucho y he visto con mis propios ojos cómo nos están arrebatando los derechos constitucionales”.
La pareja, que se casó en mayo, se perdió su primera temporada navideña juntos debido a la terrible experiencia, pero ahora planean celebrar a su manera, dijo Bovenzi. Añadió que estaba agradecida por todo el apoyo que recibió su familia.
“Mi cuerpo no quería dormirse anoche porque tenía miedo de soñar que estaba de nuevo en la cárcel”, dijo Demirtas sobre su primera noche en casa tras siete semanas encarcelado.
 Demirtas fue arrestado el 20 de noviembre cuando cumplió con una orden de comparecer a un registro de rutina del ICE en San Diego en el tribunal federal Edward Schwartz del centro de la ciudad.
 Fue uno de los cientos de personas que fueron arrestadas en California el año pasado al comparecer en controles de inmigración o audiencias judiciales. Sus antecedentes habrían hecho improbable su detención durante el gobierno de Biden. Está casado con una ciudadana estadounidense y tiene una solicitud de residencia permanente pendiente. No tiene antecedentes penales, según confirmó un abogado del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional durante una audiencia de fianza la semana pasada. Proviene de un país con un historial de derechos humanos criticado por el Departamento de Estado y llegó a Estados Unidos tras huir de la persecución religiosa. Declaró en documentos judiciales que fue torturado en Turquía debido a sus creencias religiosas.
 A pesar de esos antecedentes y de que un juez de inmigración dictaminó que podría ser liberado bajo fianza el 30 de diciembre, Demirtas permaneció detenido en el Centro de Detención de Otay Mesa hasta que el juez de distrito concedió su petición de hábeas corpus y fue liberado el martes por la noche.
 Los abogados recurren cada vez más a los tribunales federales para conseguir la liberación de sus clientes debido a las interrupciones en el sistema judicial de inmigración. La administración Trump ha despedido a más de 100 jueces de inmigración en todo el país, según la Asociación Nacional de Jueces de Inmigración.
En California, más de una cuarta parte de los jueces federales de inmigración han sido despedidos, jubilados o renunciaron desde la toma de posesión de Trump en enero de 2025. En San Francisco, al menos 12 jueces de inmigración han sido despedidos o se han quedado sin explicaciones claras, lo que agrava un atraso de 100,000 casos en la región que cubre.
Un portavoz de la Oficina Ejecutiva de Revisión de Inmigración, que supervisa los tribunales, dijo que ese despacho no hace comentarios sobre asuntos de personal.
‘Sistema implacable’
 En julio de 2025, la administración Trump emitió una directiva que requería la detención obligatoria para casi todos los no ciudadanos que ingresaran a Estados Unidos sin autorización.
 “Dado lo implacable que es el sistema migratorio actual, hay personas importantes que simplemente se dan por vencidas”, dijo Matthew Holt, abogado de inmigración de Demirtas. “Es triste verlo después de los sacrificios generacionales que han hecho”.
 Holt y otros abogados han dicho que el nuevo sistema de detener a más personas y no dejarlas salir bajo fianza o libertad condicional es como una “guerra de desgaste”, una estrategia militar en la que un bando desgasta al otro agotando sus recursos y su moral.
 En septiembre, unos 7079 casos judiciales de inmigración en todo el país finalizaron con una salida voluntaria, que permite a una persona salir del país dentro de un plazo determinado y suele conllevar sanciones menores que una orden de deportación. Esta es la cifra más alta jamás registrada en un solo mes, según datos del Centro de Acceso a Registros Transaccionales de la Universidad de Syracuse, que contiene información sobre casos desde 1997. En California, el total fue de 408.
 “Personalmente, he visto a personas con argumentos válidos, o que podrían ser válidos, decir antes de la audiencia, antes de su testimonio: ‘Quiero una orden de deportación. Quiero irme. No puedo soportarlo más'”, dijo Jeremiah Johnson, ex juez de inmigración de San Francisco, quien fue despedido el 21 de noviembre por correo electrónico sin explicación. 
 Jueces federales fallan en contra de la detención
 Un portavoz del Departamento de Justicia declinó hacer comentarios. Anteriormente, la subsecretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Tricia McLaughlin, había insistido en que Demirtas había entrado al país ilegalmente.
“Para ser claros, tener una solicitud pendiente con USCIS o la posibilidad de ser elegible para una tarjeta de residencia (green card)  no le otorga a nadie estatus legal”, dijo McLaughlin sobre el caso.
 Un documento presupuestario del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de 2024 dice que a ICE le cuesta en promedio $217 por día detener a alguien en San Diego, lo que significa que los contribuyentes estadounidenses pagaron alrededor de $10,416 para que Demirtas fuera detenido antes de que la agencia finalmente aceptara liberarlo.
 Antes del segundo mandato del presidente Donald Trump, las demandas federales conocidas como “habeas corpus” no se utilizaban con regularidad en casos de inmigración. El “habeas corpus” es el derecho constitucional que garantiza que las personas tengan la oportunidad de impugnar su encarcelamiento ante un juez.
 En 2025, se presentaron cientos de casos de hábeas corpus en el Distrito Sur de California, y miles de ellos se presentaron para inmigrantes detenidos en todo el país. En lo que va de 2026, ya se han presentado alrededor de una docena de casos similares en el Distrito Sur de California, según habeasdockets.org , un sitio web que da seguimiento a este tipo de solicitudes.
 Los jueces federales han rechazado sistemáticamente la política de detención obligatoria de Trump. En una presentación reciente en el Distrito Sur de Nueva York , el juez federal de distrito Lewis A. Kaplan señaló que los extranjeros han ganado sus peticiones de hábeas corpus en 350 de 362 casos en tribunales federales de distrito. Escribió que “160 jueces diferentes, en aproximadamente 50 tribunales diferentes repartidos por todo Estados Unidos”, dictaron las sentencias. 
 Nuevas vacantes para ‘jueces de deportación’
 Los tribunales de inmigración operan bajo la jurisdicción del poder ejecutivo, no del poder judicial independiente que supervisa los tribunales federales. Los tribunales dependen del Departamento de Justicia, lo que otorga a la administración Trump mayor autoridad sobre los jueces de inmigración. A diferencia de los tribunales penales, no se asignan abogados a quienes no pueden costear una representación legal.
 El Departamento de Justicia comenzó recientemente a anunciar puestos vacantes para “jueces de deportación”, particularmente para empleados ubicados en San Francisco, Santa Ana, Sacramento y Los Ángeles, donde se invita a los solicitantes a “combatir el fraude y garantizar que aquellos que buscan explotar las vulnerabilidades de nuestro sistema de inmigración no tengan éxito”.
 Un portavoz del Departamento de Justicia dijo que el esfuerzo tenía como objetivo “restaurar la integridad de nuestro sistema de inmigración”.
 “Después de cuatro años de que la Administración Biden obligara a los tribunales de inmigración a implementar una amnistía de facto para cientos de miles de extranjeros, este Departamento de Justicia está restaurando la integridad de nuestro sistema de inmigración y alienta a los profesionales legales talentosos a unirse a nuestra misión de proteger la seguridad nacional y la seguridad pública”, escribió en una declaración enviada por correo electrónico.
 La administración Trump también ha asignado temporalmente a abogados militares para que actúen como jueces en casos de inmigración, lo que según algunos expertos podría violar el posse comitatus, la ley del siglo XIX que define lo que los militares pueden hacer en suelo estadounidense.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/010525-Idris-Demirtas-CM-02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 13:12:18.794599

Duffy contends 54% of the state’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses reviewed by the Federal Motor Carrier Administration  (FMCSA) were issued illegally. (File photo by Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)The U.S. Department of Transportation is threatening to withhold nearly $50 million in federal funding from North Carolina if the state refuses to revoke commercial driver’s licenses the department contends were illegally issued to immigrant drivers.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy issued a statement Thursday contending 54% of the state’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses reviewed by the Federal Motor Carrier Administration  (FMCSA) were issued illegally.
Such licenses are intended to be issued to foreign nationals who are in the United States legally. Canadians and Mexicans may drive in the U.S. with their home country’s licenses for temporary visits.
“North Carolina’s failure to follow the rules isn’t just shameful – it’s dangerous,” Duffy said in a statement. “I’m calling on state leadership to immediately remove these dangerous drivers from our roads and clean up their system.”
Duffy’s statement comes amid an ongoing nationwide audit of states’ truck licensing systems by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).
North Carolina must fix its licensing “failures” and “immediately revoke” all illegally issued licenses, federal officials said.
“The level of noncompliance in North Carolina is egregious,” said FMCSA Administrator Derek D. Barrs. “Under Secretary [Sean] Duffy, we will not hesitate to hold states accountable and protect the American people.”
In a letter to Gov. Josh Stein, Barrs said the illegal licenses were discovered during an annual program review of the state CDL program initiated by his administration last August.
Barrs said his administration found that the NC Department of Transportation, Division of Motor Vehicles issued:

Non-domiciled CDLs that extend beyond the expiration of drivers’ lawful presence in the United States.
Non-domiciled CDLs to citizens of Mexico not present in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Non-domiciled CDLs without providing evidence that it verified the driver’s lawful presence in the United States.

The DMV shared this statement when asked to comment on the letter:
“NCDMV is committed to upholding safety and integrity in our licensing processes,” the agency said. “We have been collaborating closely with our federal partners for several months to resolve these matters that are impacting many U.S. states.”
U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, a Republican from Davie County, posted on  X that the “North Carolina DMV has been a complete disaster, from long wait times to paperwork issues, and beyond” under the previous administration.
“I hope Governor Stein and the @NCDOT will quickly clean up this mess left to them by the previous administration and get North Carolina back into compliance as soon as possible,” Budd posted.
To avoid losing federal funding, Duffy said the North Carolina DMV must take the following corrective actions:

Immediately pause issuance of non-domiciled CDLs
Identify all unexpired non-domiciled CDLs that fail to comply with FMCSA regulations.
Revoke and reissue all noncompliant non-domiciled CDLs if they comply with the federal requirements.
Conduct a comprehensive internal audit to identify all procedural and programming errors, training and quality assurance problems, insufficient policies and practices, and other issues that have resulted in the issuance of non-domiciled CDLs that did not meet federal rules.

Each time they leave, the woman said, they risk arrest, detention and deportation. She asked not to be identified for fear of being targeted by immigration enforcement agents. (Verite News previously interviewed the woman in August.) Her husband, a construction worker, stopped going to work entirely for the first few weeks of December, after the beginning of the U.S. Border Patrol surge in New Orleans.
Despite the risk, he has since returned to work, she said, because they need the money.
“He needs to go out and work, we have rent to pay,” she said in a message on WhatsApp in December.
“My husband works alone when he is sure that there is not much movement on the streets,” another message, sent in January, said.
The couple worry about what would happen to their child — a 4-year old U.S. citizen — if they do get picked up. So they devised a backup plan — a notarized letter that names a close friend they trust as a temporary guardian for their son, also called “provisional custody by mandate.” The letter, which was drafted in March, authorizes the friend to take the child to and from school, to take him to his medical appointments and, if necessary, to travel with him out of the country.
“Having this Plan B gives me peace of mind, knowing that no matter what happens my child will be protected and cared for,” the mother told Verite News. “This decision was made with my child’s safety and stability in mind.”
As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, a growing number of immigrant parents — even some with legal status in the U.S. — across the New Orleans metro region are making such provisions to protect their children’s well-being, immigrant rights groups told Verite News.
There is no publicly available data to show how many temporary guardianship arrangements have been created in Louisiana since Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration or since the “Catahoula Crunch” operation began in December because these mandates are private legal documents, not court orders. But representatives from local organizations that support Latino and immigrant communities, including Puentes New Orleans and Familias Unidas en Accion said they have seen a sharp increase in families requesting help with making provisional custody arrangements.
Leticia Casildo, executive director of Familias Unidas, said before 2025, her organization encouraged undocumented parents to create guardianship arrangements for their children should they ever be detained, but back then, the group had few takers.
“Maybe we would have 10 people sign up in one year,” Casildo said.
Last year, however, Casildo said more than 200 families requested help to arrange for temporary guardianship. Since Catahoula Crunch launched, Casildo said, Familias Unidas has been arranging for volunteer notaries to visit peoples’ homes to assist with getting these legal documents signed because many are afraid to leave their residences.
Suma Setty, a senior analyst of policies affecting immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy,  said her organization has received a “huge increase” in inquiries about temporary guardianship from local advocates and child care providers.
“The reason why these are becoming more popular is because parents are terrified” of what could happen if an arrangement is not in place, Setty told Verite News in a phone interview Thursday.
In April, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deported two mothers from Honduras, and their U.S. citizen children, after they were taken into custody at routine check-ins with operators of the agency’s immigrant surveillance program. A lawsuit filed in August on behalf of both families alleged that the mothers were not given the opportunity to arrange care for their U.S. citizen children, including one boy who was in treatment for stage 4 cancer.
In July, ICE issued a policy directive instructing officials to designate a “detained parent coordinator” and to “facilitate required participation in family court, child welfare, or guardianship proceedings, and communication with child welfare services” when parents or legal guardians of minors or incapacitated adult dependents are detained. ICE officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this article.
The Center for Law and Social Policy interviewed undocumented immigrant parents in six states last year. Setty said the parents who already had agreements in place were people with large social networks that included adults with legal status in the U.S. who they trusted. She stressed the importance for advocates to connect immigrant parents who don’t have those networks with people who they can build trust with.
Although temporary guardianship agreements vary from state to state, Setty said they generally allow for another adult to make decisions about children’s education, medical care and sometimes finances, while they are separated from their parents.
“These agreements are critically important for immigrant parents to ensure the best possible care for their children,” Setty said.
Arthur Ago, director of strategic litigation and advocacy at the Southern Poverty Law Center, who focuses on education and youth policy, acknowledged that such arrangements are often the best way to guarantee a child’s security when a parent is taken into immigration custody, he wishes that parents were not being forced to make them. Sudden changes in a child’s family structure have long-lasting negative consequences, he said.
“You are going to end up with children that could potentially be socially isolated within that new guardian unit, let alone if they have to move school districts,” Ago said. “That isolation destroys any sense of security and hope for children. … And that is going to set them back years.”
Originally from Guatemala, Mayra, a New Orleans mother of three with work authorization in the U.S., said she worries about how the “persecution” of immigrants is affecting her three children. Her two daughters are glued to the social media accounts of local immigrants rights activists, watching to see where Border Patrol and ICE agents are showing up next. Whenever there are alerts that agents are in their community, her kids beg her not to go outside, she said. And when she goes to work as a cleaner, they inundate her with phone calls to make sure she’s safe and will return home.
“I think the fear that they feel is more than I feel,” Mayra, who asked Verite News to use her first name only because she fears being targeted by immigration enforcement, said in Spanish, speaking through an interpreter. “After all this [is over] I don’t think they’re gonna be the same.”
When the Border Patrol operation began in New Orleans Mayra sat her daughters — ages 10 and 13 — and her 18-year-old son down to tell them the plan she’d come up with if she were to be detained. The conversation was difficult, she said. When she told her son he’d have to sell her car to make sure they had enough money to get by without her, at least for a while, the children burst into tears.
But the first thing they’d have to do, she said, was call Elizabeth, a social worker they’d known since her youngest daughter was a baby. Elizabeth had agreed to take care of the kids if Mayra were to get picked up.
Mayra didn’t make a formal arrangement with Elizabeth. Since her eldest son is 18, he would be able to maintain legal guardianship of his younger siblings. And with his permission, Elizabeth, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, would do the actual work of taking care of them.
Mayra said she trusts Elizabeth — who has previously taken the children to Guatemala to visit their family members there — completely.
Mayra and Elizabeth have both spoken about preparing her children to be independent in case they’re separated from their mother.
“It’s out of necessity, they need to be able to survive without [her],” Elizabeth, who said she is honored that Mayra asked her to watch over her children, said. “[It’s] deeply sad for the orientation for your kids to have to shift in that way.”

Free.,"Thune, GOP senators at the border tout big hiring boost for immigration crackdown",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/thune-gop-senators-border-tout-big-hiring-boost-immigration-crackdown,,"WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader John Thune, joined at the U.S.-Mexico border Friday by a handful of other Republican senators, highlighted the president’s signature tax cuts and spending package passed last year that provided billions for immigration enforcement.The press conference in McAllen, Texas, came after a federal immigration officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday, and two people were shot by Border Patrol agents late Thursday in Portland, Oregon.Thune, a South Dakota Republican, touted how the tax cuts and spending package signed into law last summer also provided “for additional reinforcements,” such as the hiring of more Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. On Jan. 3, ICE announced it hired 12,000 new officers, more than doubling its force from 10,000 agents to 22,000. Thousands more are set to be hired.The GOP-passed bill also included $4.1 billion for Customs and Border Protection to hire 5,000 customs officers and 3,000 Border Patrol agents over the next four years.Thune said because migration at the southern border has slowed, the time has come for President Donald Trump to shift his focus to immigration reform. CBP data from November, the most recent available, shows total apprehensions at the southwest border slowed to 7,350 that month.“I think President Trump is probably the president best equipped to lead the effort to reform immigration law in his country in a way that it creates, again, those better paying jobs, opportunities for people who come to the country legally,” Thune said. “We are a nation of immigrants, but we're also a nation of laws, and we have to make sure we're enforcing our laws, and that's where it starts.”The Trump administration has continued with its aggressive mass deportation efforts throughout the interior of the country and has moved to revoke the legal status of more than 1.5 million immigrants since taking office last January. Thune added that the GOP bill, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, also provided billions for border security.“As a result of the passage of the One Big, Beautiful bill … we got more resources down here, not only for physical infrastructure, for the wall, but for also that virtual infrastructure, for technology and counter drone technology, all those sorts of things that make it possible for the Border Patrol to do their job,” he said.Thune was joined by Whip John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Ashley Moody of Florida, Jon Husted of Ohio, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.Rounds said that under the Trump administration the southern border has undergone “a remarkable transformation.” “There is no such thing as a country that can be a superpower, or, for that matter, be free if they can't defend their own borders,” Rounds said. Cornyn also highlighted how the bill will reimburse, up to $13.5 billion, those border states who have spent money on immigration enforcement. He said of that money, Texas will get $11 billion.",,,,2026-01-09 12:57:21.783382

National Popcorn Day is celebrated annnually on January 19th.
Some bucket list moments involve big trips or long-term goals, but others are delightfully simple. Going to the movies with a bucket of fresh popcorn definitely qualifies, and this National Popcorn Day, Penn Cinema is giving movie lovers a fun and flavorful way to check that moment off the list.
National Popcorn Day, celebrated annually on January 19, spotlights one of America’s most iconic movie snacks, with roots tracing back thousands of years to Indigenous cultures in the Southwest. From movie theaters to community events across Delaware, popcorn remains a simple, crunchy favorite; sometimes the best traditions come with a little butter and a lot of pop.
The Penn Cinema location on the Wilmington Riverfront is celebrating National Popcorn Day with a special bring your own bucket promotion. On January 18 and 19, moviegoers can bring their own bucket and have it filled with popcorn for just $5, adding a playful twist to a classic moviegoing tradition.
There are a few important guidelines guests should know before heading out. Buckets must be clean and watertight, and the maximum fill is limited to 400 ounces. The promotion is available while supplies last, so planning an earlier showtime may help ensure fans can take advantage of the deal.
The bucket fill turns an everyday snack into a shared experience and invites moviegoers to get a little creative. Some may bring a favorite reusable popcorn tub, while others might dust off a souvenir bucket from a past movie night. The rules are simple, and the fun comes from making the experience your own.
National Popcorn Day is also a reminder that bucket list moments do not have to be complicated. Catching a movie you have been meaning to see, sharing popcorn with friends or family, or carving out time to enjoy the big screen can be just as satisfying as checking off something much bigger.
Located along the Wilmington Riverfront, Penn Cinema makes it easy to turn a movie night into a full evening out. Many visitors pair a film with dining or a walk along the waterfront, while others make the theater the main destination. The Riverfront setting adds to the appeal, especially during the winter months when indoor entertainment takes center stage.
With a rotating lineup of current releases, Penn Cinema continues to offer audiences the opportunity to experience movies the way they were meant to be seen. Comfortable seating, large screens, and a shared audience all contribute to the magic that keeps people coming back to the theater.
As winter routines settle in and calendars fill up, National Popcorn Day offers a reason to slow down and enjoy something familiar. A movie ticket, a bucket of popcorn, and a couple of hours to escape into a story might be one of the easiest bucket list items to check off this year.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The state auditor called out a publicly-funded historical society in western Nebraska for potential misuse of a debit card, including the purchase of a pink oil burner from a Colorado vape shop.
A tip prompted the state probe of the Plains Historical Society in Kimball County, and results of that financial review led to a nine-page letter this week to the society and its board president, Jack Shaw.

Shaw’s daughter, Lisa, whom the audit team identified as a former board member of the historical society, was a target of the review. The state report alleges that Lisa Shaw persuaded the board to start using a debit card.
According to the state audit team, she made 54 purchases with the debit card during a roughly six-week period in 2024 totaling $1,386 for “apparently personal purposes.” The report itemized buys from places including a Kwik Stop, cafes, a Sugar Shack, diners, gas stations and a parking lot.
The audit team emphasized a $31 transaction at a vape and glass shop that included the pink-colored oil burner. A copy of a receipt and photos of the store were included in the report, along with a remark questioning “whether any of the products listed above could possibly be considered a reasonable or allowable expenditure of [historical] society funds.”
 Findings go to law enforcement

Debit card purchases were made from the historical society’s general fund bank account, which contains a mix of public and non-public funds. The audit team said the society did not appear to be accounting for the funds separately. 
Thus, it said, all the money should be considered restricted under state law to certain uses, such as construction of historical buildings, purchase of property of historical significance and related maintenance and storage.
State Auditor Mike Foley’s team called the situation concerning, regardless of whether reimbursement was made for “suspect charges.” The report noted that the board chairman, Jack Shaw, reimbursed the society in September 2024 for the questionable purchases. The debit card also was canceled.
The audit report said the society’s board is responsible for financial accountability and control over operations, including ensuring that public funds are spent according to state law. Foley’s office turned over its findings to the Nebraska Attorney General and Kimball County Attorney for review. 
The Shaws could not be reached for comment, but a board member, speaking on background, said he had discovered and reported potential misuse of the debit card to the local police department back in 2024. He said Jack Shaw reimbursed the society from his personal funds and that Lisa Shaw was voted off the board.
He said board members take the museum and preservation of history “very seriously and they want to keep it going.”

The audit report included a written response from Jack Shaw. He said the society’s governing board on Dec. 4, 2025, voted to reaffirm its decision to stop using a debit card and to open a separate account for non-restricted funds and to prohibit cash withdrawals except when specific requirements are met. He also included a letter to the entity’s bank laying out stricter procedures for cash withdrawals. 
Foley’s team noted in its report that debit cards do not provide as much fraud protection as credit cards and other more secure forms of payment and urged a more formal written policy outlining procedures for safeguarding public assets.
While Lisa Shaw is identified in the report as a former board member, Foley said she was an active member at the time of the questionable purchases. 
 ‘Get it right’ 

Listed as a public benefit nonprofit corporation established in 1957, the historical society owns and operates the Plains Historical Society Museum in Kimball. State law authorizes counties to grant such historical societies an annual amount of general tax funds for certain purposes, Foley’s office said.
With roughly 2,700 units of government under the watch of the state auditor, Foley said a little-known historical society ordinarily wouldn’t catch his attention. He said the tipster was helpful and that such examinations often have “a ripple effect” in sending a message for small and large governmental entities to be watchful.
“You’ve got to get it right,” he said. “It might be your time.”

(Photo courtesy of South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks)Custer State Park’s main highways and trails are open to visitors after last month’s high-speed winds swept through western South Dakota, but officials are warning visitors to stay aware of their surroundings.
Cleanup crews have been working to remove fallen trees and repair damages to park facilities, but there are still cracked trees that may be cause for concern, according to Matt Snyder, a parks regional supervisor for western South Dakota.
Though the park is open, Snyder is encouraging visitors to “be cognizant.”
“Be looking up ahead, up above you and see what’s going on. If you hear the winds blowing or something like that, I’d probably stay off the trails that day,” Snyder said. “But, if you do find yourself out there, just be looking above your head and see what’s going on, and just stay safe.”
Governor seeks federal help for damages from December wind storm

A western South Dakota windstorm last month damaged Custer State Park’s campgrounds, trees, park facilities and power systems.
Wind gusts were as high as 101 miles per hour between Dec. 17 and 18, according to the National Weather Service. The storm downed thousands of mature trees, tore through facilities and campgrounds and left Custer State Park without power for nearly a week.
The park lost one camping cabin to the storm, Snyder said, which is the most substantial damage. Other damage can be fixed.
“From a structural standpoint, everything’s going to be fine,” he said. “It’s just a matter of getting the repairs done.”
Snyder said 65 workers from across state departments including Transportation, Wildland Fire and an inmate crew helped to cut through some of the fallen trees last week, especially those blocking roadways and hiking trails.
Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Wednesday he’s asked the federal government for help to repair public property across the region. Park leaders are still working through the Office of Emergency Management to determine the final cost of repairs at Custer State Park.
Park officials said lodges and cabins have been minimally impacted, without any serious impacts on guests. They plan to have damaged facilities open and ready for visitors again in April.

Jan. 9, 2026 | ScreenshotDetroit Mayor Mary Sheffield took a final victory lap on Friday with an investiture ceremony at the Detroit Opera House that, at times, felt more like church and a gospel concert than your average swearing-in for a government official.
Sheffield, the daughter and granddaughter of renowned pastors and civil rights leaders and an accomplished politician in her own right, gathered the city’s elected officials, several faith leaders and a large audience of friends and community members to extol her gratitude to the city for electing her in a November 2025 landslide.
“Throughout this journey, I didn’t always know every step ahead, but I trusted the calling, and I kept moving forward. And if this means anything, this moment today, I hope that it reminds every Detroiter of this truth,” Sheffield said. “That every single person gathered here today, every Detroiter across this city, has a purpose, has a unique gift, one that no one else can offer in quite the same way. And when we choose to walk in that purpose, when we choose faith over fear, courage over doubt, and we choose to say yes, even when the path is not always clear, extraordinary things can happen.”
Mary Sheffield makes history: Detroit elects first woman mayor

The event was headlined by Sheffield’s investiture but also featured a swearing in ceremony for newly elected or reelected members of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners, the Detroit City Council and Detroit Clerk Janice Winfrey.
But it was certainly Sheffield who was in the spotlight, with poets, gospel singers, faith leaders and judges each offering their support, encouragement and blessings to the new mayor as she charts a path forward.
Sheffield thanked her family and close allies, as well as Mike Duggan, the city’s former mayor, for his role in helping the city progress. Now, it will be Sheffield’s job to keep that momentum and to help the city rise even higher, which is consequentially the slogan of her transition team as she gets settled.
“In this next chapter, we draw our strength from the prayers, the purpose and the power of generations who came before us; those who understood that improving the quality of life for all Detroiters is not the work of one leader but the responsibility of an entire city,” Sheffield said. “Here in Detroit, Dr. King first shared his dream, calling this city in this nation to become a beloved community. And that call is still relevant today, and it calls on all of us, not just those in elected office, but every resident, every community leader, every neighborhood, every institution that is gathered here today to do our part, Detroit, our futures are bound together.”
In another sign that it was a new day in Detroit’s history, Sheffield said that progress in her administration will be measured by who it helps along the way. In that vein, Sheffield said progress would be real only when it “reaches every block, every family, in every community in this city.”
“In this administration, every voice will guide our path, including voices that, for too often, have been overlooked. We will work every single day to build a Detroit that works for everyone,” Sheffield said, “by strengthening and investing in our neighborhoods, expanding access to programs and city services, and ensuring that every Detroiter truly feels the resurgence of our city.”
Sheffield said those goals will focus on safe and affordable housing, good-paying jobs that support families, reliable transit that connects Detroiters to opportunities and safety rooted in prevention and accountability so families feel safe in their neighborhoods and children are protected.
“We will value the hard work of labor, champion our legacy in our start up businesses and make Detroit the best place to start and grow a business,” Sheffield added. And lastly, we will empower and support our young people. That deserves a round of applause. I am energized by the generations of our youth that are rising across this city discovering their purpose right here at home, just as I did. We must continue to invest in their growth and build a Detroit where young people can dream without limits and see those dreams take shape right here at home.”

,Mississippi Today,2026-01-09 17:15:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Why is Simpson County’s chronic absenteeism rate so high? School district officials want to know how to help,Leonardo Bevilacqua and Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2026/01/09/simpson-county-seeks-truancy-fix/,Magee High School principal Duriel Banks walks through a neighborhood for an initiative that addresses truancy.,"PINOLA — Aaron Thompson drives his two elementary-aged children to school each day, but only when they aren’t sick or the road isn’t flooded. The family of four lives off a ragged stretch of concrete bounded on one side by a hunting trail and, on the other, by a worn bridge dotted with orange traffic cones.
Thompson admits that his kids are likely what the Mississippi Department of Education describes as “chronically absent,” a term for students who miss 18 or more days of instruction in a school year. Simpson County School District has the third-largest chronically absent population of any school district in the state, behind Moss Point School District and Claiborne County School District. 
The problem is statewide — chronic absenteeism rates in Mississippi surged from 13% in the 2017-18 academic year to 28% in 2024-25. But a closer look in Simpson County reveals a complicated story about student absenteeism.
Like most other counties where 75% or more of children require free and reduced lunch, almost half of students are considered chronically absent in Simpson County. The reasons vary by family, with explanations oftentimes exposing a fraying social safety net now relying on younger helpers around the house to take care of elderly relatives and toddlers and teenage laborers in town, who work to contribute to their household income. 
Aaron Thompson, a father in Simpson County, says he has replaced the front end of his car three times in the last four years because of wear and tear from driving on pockmarked roads.

Pinola, which lies in the southern half of Simpson County, is a community so rural that some of its roads don’t appear on Google Maps.
“Out here in the sticks it’s not so bad,” Thompson said. But he estimates that he has replaced the front end of his car three times in the last four years.
Chronic absenteeism is “a national problem,” Simpson County School District Superintendent Robert Sanders said. “I would like parents to know that we want to work alongside them to make sure their kids can learn.”
More than the robocall
Sanders took over Simpson County School District in July and was surprised to learn in October that his district had the third-highest rate of chronic absenteeism in the state. He gathered his principals and implored them to come up with an attendance strategy that would work for their students.

Magee High School Principal Jammal Banks, along with a school resource officer and the district communications professional, visited homes of students who hadn’t shown up for classes. Of Simpson County schools, Magee High had the highest rate of absenteeism at 67.2%. 
The group’s three door-knocking trips acted as a fact-finding mission and an opportunity for administrators to reach out in a friendly manner before truancy officers and the youth court got involved. Under the state’s compulsory attendance law, parents and guardians can be charged with contributing to the neglect of a child once a school attendance officer, or truancy officer, has made “all attempts to secure enrollment and/or attendance of a compulsory-school-age child and is unable to effect the enrollment and/or attendance.”
When a parent or guardian sees an administrator at their home about their child’s attendance, “they know we care about them and don’t just exist as a robocall,” Banks said. Some parents weren’t aware their child had missed so many days, he said.
In total, the Magee High group knocked on 17 doors. By the next week, 13 students had returned to class, though a handful reverted later to absenteeism. Banks said he regularly speaks to the truancy officer assigned to the local high school and middle school. The other one in the school district is based out of Mendenhall, where the bulk of the other schools are clustered.
The trio has taken three visits, speaking to at least five families on each one. They try to find solutions with parents and students, putting them in touch with the school counselor. Banks also put together an assembly called Commit to Graduation where students sign pledges to graduate on time.
Banks said students often express appreciation for the visits, saying, “I didn’t know you cared about me that much.”
‘There are a lot of us’
Teachers follow what educators call a pacing guide, which maps out the order in which instructors teach subject-specific skills and provides an outline for the curriculum.
Each day or week is dedicated to mastering a core competency or skill as it relates to literacy, math, science or social studies. When students stop showing up, especially those in need of additional support, the consequences can be hard to mitigate later on.
Christi Dampeer, a third grade teacher in Mendenhall, has noticed that nearly every student in her multi-tiered support system, or MTSS, group is chronically absent. MTSS is a program that helps academically struggling students stay on track to get promoted to the next grade level. Dampeer finds time to help chronically absent students catch up, but that can be difficult if students miss more than a handful of consecutive classes.
She has noticed that many parents allow their third graders to miss class, thinking the lower elementary math courses are far removed from important benchmarks. Damper said she often hears parents say those grade levels aren’t covering meaningful topics yet.
Some parents and community members also say engaging students in coursework will require active participation from families as well as school staff.

Thompson said his children were sick four times during the 2024-25 school  year, mostly with strep throat. He fears that policies pressuring sick students to attend class have contributed to their more frequent illnesses. He sometimes feels that an at home learning environment is more secure for his children, and has considered homeschooling.
Thompson subscribes to ABC Mouse, an educational video game, for the days that his second-grader and fourth-grader are unable to attend school.
Crystal Blair, who has two children enrolled in Mendenhall schools, said she has been more involved in their schoolwork because she also recently enrolled as a student. She is finishing an undergraduate degree. Unlike some parent friends of hers, Blair has been able to do algebra homework with her daughter. 
“I would like to see more parents help out,” Blair said. “But a lot don’t have the same help at home. Some don’t have W-Ffi.”
Dampeer also noticed that students’ needs aren’t always being met outside of the classroom, which affects their academic performance. She teaches students who regularly miss class for doctors’ appointments and out-of-school counseling. Some parents, Dampeer said, do not push their children to show up to class.
School Counselor Baritt Blount stocks a closet full of clean clothes and teaches students about proper hygiene. She regularly meets students from homes without running water and where parental supervision is slim. The school also has showers and hygiene kits available to those students, she said. 
Blount also tracks those students’ absences. Sometimes, she also visits students at home to talk to a parent or guardian.
“Ever since the pandemic, we’ve been fighting the battle on the flip side,” she said. “Kids are still struggling to get back into familiar routines.”
For one part-time cafeteria employee and grandmother, chronic absenteeism was difficult to avoid because of absent parents. She asked to not share her name out of fear of retaliation at work and from relatives.
The grandmother didn’t expect to be helping raise three grandchildren after rearing four of her own. She ensures they attend school regularly, which wasn’t a priority when their mother was raising them alone.
“You go to Walmart, there are a lot of us,” she said of her new guardian role. “Babies are having babies. Parents aren’t mature enough to take care of their own kids.”
Before her grandchildren and their 26-year-old mother moved in with her, she estimates that the children missed most of the school days the week prior. The grandmother said she was never able to get an adequate answer from her daughter about why they did not attend.
The high school job
Pamela Hobbs teaches mostly seniors in a college and career readiness class at Mendenhall High School. She said she believes the absenteeism resulted from unclear expectations for graduating seniors who had completed most diploma requirements. She has also seen a lot of her students “thrust into adult roles.”
“You still have to do your resume, anything can happen, and you never know,” Hobbs tells her students, even those who have secured local jobs before graduating.

To help prepare for a postsecondary world, Hobbs’ students complete in-class resume writing workshops and other workforce development instruction.
“Those students who are chronically absent are making their own choices, and not like when I was a senior,” she said. “Young people want to be held accountable and want to be responsible.”
Few jobs are open to high schoolers in Pinola. Kiana Russell, a manager at the local Dollar General, began to interview more high schoolers in 2023, after the store changed its policy to allow 16- year-olds to work there.
“You can tell the ones who really need it,” Russell said of part-time work. “It’s a good job for them because they get to see their friends in town and help out around the store.”
School staff have talked with local employers to ensure teenage workers aren’t working late on weeknights. 
Absenteeism for Mississippi high school seniors rose 9% over the past two years. Many seniors who have fulfilled their graduation requirements leave school during the third period for jobs. Some also participate in a late entry program, whereby students who work late hours can have no first period classes. 
Many students’ unexcused absences occur around holidays, on rainy days or when they’re exempt from exams.
Those practices shocked Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, who conveyed his disappointment to education officials at an October state Senate committee meeting. 
Officials seem to be “signaling to students it’s not really important to come to school,” he said. “We’re shifting from the concept of, there’s an infinite number of things to learn … to something that is so focused on the requirements and testing.”
‘We can’t teach empty seats’
By 3 p.m. on school days, Mendenhall’s teen workforce trades their book bags for aprons. They bag groceries, scan items at the cash register and prepare food at a drive-through. Grocers, fast food joints and hardware stores employ them. Many chronically absent students fall into this category of holding part-time jobs, according to districtwide data. Their jobs often become a priority over their classes.
Mendenhall, the Simpson County seat and second largest city, is about 40 miles southeast from Jackson. Its downtown is dwarfed by a towering courthouse with a dark green dome. Popular area businesses include the Broadhead Do It Center hardware store, Vowell’s Marketplace grocery store and Ward’s, a fast food restaurant. The city’s population is 2,199 people, 28.9% of whom live in poverty.

For many Simpson County residents, a high school job is more than a rite of passage. As one grocery store manager put it, it’s how many high schoolers save enough money for college. 
Blount, the Magee Middle School counselor, still recalls the summer she clerked at her mother’s medical clinic, the afternoons and evenings helping out at a local eye doctor, and when she made sandwiches at a Subway. Afterschool jobs were a key part of her high school years along with algebra and extracurriculars.
Growing up in Magee, Blount said, her parents regularly told her that “school comes first.” Now she echoes that idea for some of her students and their parents. She said she sees her role as a counselor as “bringing the community together” and convincing parents and students of the value of an education. She doesn’t want a job or caretaker role to derail a student’s future.
“We can ensure every kid can come to school, be focused, be ready, be confident in their needs,” Blount said.
Sanders, the Simpson County superintendent, said it’s a priority to incorporate the feedback of high school educators and experts into attendance plans. He offers incentives such as  popsicle parties and other events for students with perfect and nearly perfect attendance records. He has encouraged teachers and principals to pioneer new classroom activities that make use of technology or software like Kahoot, an online learning game. 
“We are trying to create an environment where students want to come,” Sanders said. “We can’t teach empty seats. If there are barriers, share that with us.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/31110819/Truancy10_Submitted-Photo.jpg,,,2026-01-09 12:57:21.783382

Bush, ordered Thursday that the university […]","Ramsi Woodcock has been reassigned from teaching and banned from entering the University of Kentucky College of Law, where he is an assistant professor.A federal judge denied a request from a University of Kentucky law professor to allow him to return to the classroom and end an investigation into his criticism of Israel and support of Palestine. 
U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves, who was appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, ordered Thursday that the university may continue its investigation into alleged conduct by Professor Ramsi Woodcock. The judge requested to be apprised of the results to make future rulings in the case. 
Reeves’ 41-page order showed that he remained largely unconvinced by Woodcock’s attorneys’ allegations of bias in the university’s actions. 
“While Woodcock may fear a nefarious intent behind the University’s investigation, he has not cleared the bar of demonstrating that the investigation was taken to harass or in bad faith,” Reeves wrote. “Instead, the University’s investigation was triggered by external complaints.” 
Woodcock filed the lawsuit in November seeking to be returned to his duties as a full-time tenured professor. His suit also seeks to block UK from using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in disciplinary proceedings.
“This case is about university officials torching the First Amendment and the university’s own regulations in an effort to protect a colonization project that practices apartheid and commits genocide,” Woodcock said in a statement to the Lantern Friday. 
“There is strong precedent stretching back to the Civil War that federal courts must intervene when rogue state actors, like the university officials in my case, abuse their authority to try to silence speech that they happen to dislike. I am confident that, with the aid of advice from an appellate panel, the court will act to reinstate me to teaching, and that could potentially happen during the coming semester.”
Jay Blanton, a spokesperson for the university, told the Lantern in a statement that UK “appreciates the Court’s thoughtful and clear ruling in this matter.” 
“The review of Professor Woodcock’s conduct is ongoing, and we will provide updates as the court has asked for in its ruling,” Blanton added. 
Woodcock and UK officials testified in federal court last month. During the hours-long proceeding, Woodcock disputed allegations against him, saying the university misrepresented actions that were part of an academic’s life, such as engaging in scholarly debate. He said his comments on Palestine and Israel were rooted in months-long academic research.
In letters to Woodcock, UK cited four professors who had heard him speak at academic conferences or read his comments on Listservs. They told UK that Woodcock spoke about genocide in Gaza at an academic conference and during another university’s panel discussion and had “spammed” Listservs with personal viewpoints on Palestine and Israel. UK later said four students “some of whom are Jewish” had said Woodcock spoke about the topic in an optional lecture and had shouted “Free Palestine” while in a car with UK law students.
Woodcock’s complaint said he does not talk about his conclusions regarding Palestine and Israel “in his classes because he did not want to cause students to face persecution for speaking about Palestine.”
Woodcock’s attorneys have raised concerns about the ability of Farnaz Farkish Thompson, a partner of McGuire Woods based in Richmond, Virginia, hired by the university, to be an unbiased investigator in the matter. In a letter to her, they said she was listed as a contributor to Project 2025, which was created as a guiding document for the Trump administration leading up to the 2024 presidential election. The document calls for U.S. support of Israel.
Among his various conclusions, Reeves wrote: “It should come as no surprise that the University would seek out an investigator with background knowledge on Israel and Palestine relations due to the nature of the speech at issue. That hiring choice does not breach the threshold for bad faith or harassment.” 
Reeves also said Woodcock’s attorneys failed to show that UK President Eli Capilouto would be “a biased adjudicator” in determining disciplinary proceedings into the professor’s conduct. Capilouto shared a public message in July that did not name Woodcock directly, but indicated the university was aware of his online petition calling for military action against Israel and called his views “if accurately attributed … repugnant.”
Woodcock received notice of the university’s investigation days later. 
Reeves said that UK “must be allowed to distance itself from any ideology or speech that threatens its efficient operations or undermines its mission or ethos.” 
Woodcock has continued to remain “a tenured faculty member with full pay and benefits from the University” while he has not been allowed to teach or enter the College of Law building, Reeves wrote. The judge said that “does not generally threaten irreparable harm.” Woodcock had testified that by not having access to the law building, he could not continue attending faculty meetings or use the law library for research. 
Woodcock may amend his complaint after “the investigation is completed or any subsequent disciplinary procedures have concluded and claims have been exhausted,” Reeves said. 
Both sides are to give status reports every 30 days to Reeves about the status of the investigation and other future proceedings.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-22-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-09 12:12:36.638771

Eric Chung announced Tuesday that his campaign for the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District has raised over $1,125,000 million, including more than $255,000 raised in the 4th Quarter of 2025.
Former Navy SEAL Matt Maasdam’s campaign to win the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 7th District announced Tuesday that it raised more than $1 million in 2025, including $400,000 in 2025’s 4th Quarter. Maasdam also announced the endorsement of grassroots organizer Susan Anderson, a founder of the Blue Brigade.
Also seeking the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 7th Congressional District is former Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink, who said her campaign had raised more than $530,000 in the final quarter of 2025, combining for a total of $1.6 million.
State Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo), who is seeking the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 4th Congressional District, said on Thursday his campaign has raised over half a million dollars in 2025, including more than $250,000 from 2,000 individual donors in the 4th Quarter.
Suzanna Shkreli, a Democratic latecomer to the race for Michigan’s Secretary of State, said her campaign has raised another $100,000 in the final weeks of December, with a total of over $300,000 raised since joining the race in early December.
 
 Endorsements

Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum’s campaign for the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s Secretary of State announced Thursday additional endorsements from more than a dozen current and former elected officials, including former U.S. Reps. Jim Barcia (D-Bay City), Mark Schauer (D-Battle Creek) and Joe Schwarz (R-Battle Creek), as well as UA 671 Plumbers, Pipefitters, HVAC & Welders, the Greater Lansing Labor Council and the Progressive Democratic Women’s Caucus of Muskegon.
State Sen. Roger Victory (R-Hudsonville) announced Wednesday that he is seeking to run as Republican for the Michigan State University Board of Trustees. Victory, who is term-limited, was quickly endorsed by the Michigan Agri-Business Association PAC.
On Thursday, the Michigan Professional Fire Fighters Union announced its endorsement of Tim Greimel in his bid to secure the Democratic nomination for Michigan’s 10th Congressional District.
 
 Announcements

Former Washtenaw County assistant prosecutor Christina Hines said Friday she had submitted 2,000 signatures to get on the ballot in her bid to win the Democratic nomination to represent Michigan’s 10th Congressional District, “the first candidate in the field to complete Michigan’s required signature collection process for the August and November ballots.”

The sites, which were awarded to the Oklahoma tribe and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation, are the first two testing grounds for drones and other unmanned aircraft created in nearly a decade, according to the FAA.
In a statement Friday, James Grimsley, the Choctaw Nation’s executive director of Advanced Technology Initiatives, said the “designation is a meaningful step” for both the tribe and the future of aviation in Oklahoma.
The test site program is designed to evaluate the safety, operations and navigation systems of public and civil drone technologies prior to their use in national airspace, he said.
The Choctaw Nation said that the designation “comes at a critical time” as the FAA moves to create new rules that allows drones to be flown beyond line of sight, or where operators can’t see them, which will expand their commercial and public safety uses.
“Drone technology is already changing how services are delivered and how critical infrastructure is inspected, monitored and protected,” Grimsley said. “The next chapter is about proving what works safely at scale, and our role as a test site is to generate the data, operational insights and best practices that help make that possible.” 
In a separate statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new test sites will help gather critical data so “we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”
The FAA said Duffy unveiled a proposed Beyond Visual Line of Sight rule to expand drone usage in August.
“From delivering lifesaving medicine to surveying pipelines, drones are already reshaping industries and changing how people and products interact,” Duffy said in a statement. “It’s our job to make sure the United States safely leads the way with this exciting technology – not China. We’ve added these new test sites to help us gather critical data and test new systems so we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”

Plan selections and premium payments weren’t processed for some people who purchased coverage from ConnectiCare on the state exchange, Access Health CT CEO James Michel said.
“Access Health CT is notifying all impacted consumers. People may contact ConnectiCare directly for information regarding billing issues,” Michel stated.
Officials haven’t yet been able to confirm how many people were impacted. Michel estimated that it’s no more than 1,000. 
Ben Jackey, a ConnectiCare spokesperson, did not address a question from the Connecticut Mirror about how many people were impacted, but said the issue stemmed from a “system conversion” on Jan. 1.
“We are working diligently to rectify any related issues temporarily impacting members. ConnectiCare is committed to providing high-quality health plans and service and we encourage members to contact us with any questions,” Jackey stated in emailed comments.
The Connecticut Department of Insurance had only “just begun” hearing of the issues on Wednesday, the agency’s assistant deputy commissioner Gerard O’Sullivan stated in emailed comments.
“We are working with ConnectiCare and Access Health CT to determine the scope of the problem and expect to have more information in the next few days. Any consumer who is experiencing issues is encouraged to contact the Connecticut Insurance Department so we can review and intervene on individual cases,” O’Sullivan said.
While current estimates suggest the impact is relatively contained, reports of the glitches come at a hectic time for ACA plan enrollees. There are just three weeks remaining in Connecticut’s open enrollment period, and some residents are reassessing what coverage they can afford following the Dec. 31 expiration of some federal financial assistance for subsidies.
On Feb. 1, 2025, ConnectiCare was acquired by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that has members in 22 states. 
Connecticut residents have been complaining online about processing issues, website issues and customer service delays since the Jan. 1 conversion. Several pointed out that “Connecticut” wasn’t even an option in the state dropdown menu on Molina’s website.
Molina is one of two companies that offers individual medical plans on Connecticut’s health exchange, in addition to Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. 
In 2025, Molina-owned companies, which included ConnectiCare Insurance Company and ConnectiCare Benefits, covered nearly half of the more than 150,000 residents enrolled in a state exchange plan.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP105258032254-1024x717.jpg,,,2026-01-09 11:59:39.628927

The person stayed  at the Hyatt Place in Hamburg from December 31, 2025 – January 2, 2026, the health department announced on social media. 
“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can cause serious health complications, especially in young children. Vaccination is the best protection against measles,” the health department said. “If you have concerns about exposure to measles, contact your health care provider.” 
According to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, there were 13 cases of measles in Kentucky last year. 
Kentucky health officials recently announced another potential exposure from an unvaccinated traveler who visited the Ark Encounter in Williamstown on Dec. 29 and stayed at the Holiday Inn & Suites in Dry Ridge Dec. 28-30.
Measles is extremely contagious and spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old.

Vaccinations have fallen and measles cases nationwide increased, with 2025 bringing the highest number of reported cases since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000. Connecticut reported one case, and the state had the highest MMR, or measles, mumps and rubella, vaccination rates in the nation among kindergarteners for the 2024-2025 school year.
In Connecticut, 98.2% of kindergarteners received their MMR vaccine, according to CDC data. Herd immunity, a form of indirect protection against the spread of communicable disease, is met when 95% or more of a population is vaccinated. Only nine other states reached herd immunity for the MMR vaccine in the 2024-2025 school year.
Overall vaccination rates for Connecticut children have increased since 2020 after they fell during pandemic. According to a Washington Post analysis, the only other states to see this increase were Maine and Alabama.
Connecticut only allows for medical exemptions to vaccinations for school-age children after eliminating religious exemptions in 2021. The state does not allow personal exemptions. But even with these laws, some schools did not meet the 95% threshold for herd immunity.
However, many towns in the state met herd immunity for last year’s kindergarten classes. Some have very high levels of vaccination — over 98%.
While the state has high levels of childhood vaccination, seasonal vaccination rates are not as high. This flu season, according to state data as of Dec. 2, the flu vaccination rate was down 6% compared to the same time last year. There has also been an increase in flu cases and hospitalizations, and cases are far higher this year than they were the same time last year.
This overload of flu cases came just before this week’s announcement from the Trump administration overhauling the childhood vaccination schedule.

(Photo via Getty Images; DIAL logo courtesy of Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing)State, city and county inspectors have cited Iowa restaurants and stores for hundreds of food-safety violations during the past several weeks, including offenses related to long-expired food, unlicensed operators and dirty kitchens.
The findings are reported by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which handles food-establishment inspections at the state level.
Listed below are some of the more serious findings that stem from inspections at Iowa restaurants, stores, care facilities and other businesses between Nov. 13, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2025. (Last year, DIAL began withholding from public disclosure all food-safety inspection reports for eight days past the date of inspection.)
The inspections department reminds the public that its reports are a “snapshot” in time, and violations are often corrected on the spot before the inspector leaves the establishment. For a more complete list of all inspections, along with additional details on each of the inspections listed below, visit the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing’s website.
Big R’s Bar & Grill, 103 Main St., Elberon — During a Dec. 31 visit, a state inspector cited this Tama County establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. Violations included failure to ensure that all food came from approved sources as evidenced by “venison peppersticks” that were labeled “not for sale” and were stored in a chest freezer alongside other food items. The restaurant was also cited for home-canned vegetables that were stored on kitchen shelves alongside food used to serve patrons.
“Cooking pots and pans on the stove were not clean and have not been used since yesterday,” the inspector noted. “Onion slicer and potato dicer have dried food debris and buildup (although) the person in charge states they have not been used for several days.”
In addition, the flat-top grill and the flame grill each had a “large buildup” of an unspecified nature, and the kitchen sink designated for handwashing was blocked with several dirty dishes and was not accessible for handwashing. Also, household pest-control chemicals were stored in areas where food and clean equipment were being stored, an open package of rodent bait was found in the kitchen, and the food-preparation table and breading station were soiled.
“Floors are not kept clean in the kitchen and dry storage rooms,” the inspector reported. “Living quarters within the facility were open to the restaurant during the inspection.”
State records show the restaurant last underwent a routine inspection in April 2021.
Wilbo Burgers Brats & Beers, 118 Main St., Cedar Falls — During a Dec. 29 visit, a Black Hawk County inspector cited this restaurant for employees failing to wash their hands, storing food-to-go containers on the floor of the basement under a set of water pipes, for an unspecified “buildup” of some kind within the ice machine, and for green peppers and house-made barbecue sauce that had been held longer than the maximum of seven days. Also, there was no detectable level of sanitizing solution used at the wait station, and the hot water supplied to the handwashing sink had been shut off due to a slow leak.
Eddie’s Tavern, 407 D St., Sergeant Bluff — During a Dec. 23 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector found bags of shredded lettuce and tomatoes that had a discard date of Dec. 13, 2025. Also, the interior of the ice machine was visibly soiled with “debris buildup” and the kitchen wall behind and alongside the griddle was melting, with the wall covering “breaking off.”
Nara Thai, 1725 Blairs Ferry Road, Marion — During a Dec. 23 visit, a Linn County inspector noted that salmon and shrimp were stored in the same tray as cucumbers and mixed peppers inside the refrigerator – a repeat violation. Also, five bars of cream cheese were sitting out at room temperature and were measured at 66 degrees before the staff agreed to discard them. In addition, there was a container of Thai soup that was not date-marked as to when it was either prepared or needed to be discarded – a repeat violation. In addition, the handwashing station in the kitchen was not supplied with soap, and employees’ personal food was stored in the refrigerator and freezer alongside food to be served to patrons.
Fareway, 115 1st Ave., Sioux Center — During a Dec. 22 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector noted that the meat department staff was not following proper handwashing protocols while packaging food for customers. Also, deviled eggs and cut pineapple were still in the display case and being offered for sale after their discard date.
The Other Place, 2010 SE Delaware, Ankeny — During a Dec. 22 visit, a state inspector found taco meat that had been holding in the walk-in cooler for two hours and had yet to drop below 85 degrees. The taco meat was then discarded. The inspector also noted that preparation and discard times on pizza slices were not being documented or monitored. The pizza slices were discarded.
In addition, there was no soap at the handwashing sink, and the inspector discussed with management the fact that cooked taco meat, chicken wings and grinder meat were all being cooled in large plastic tubs, which inhibited their ability to cool rapidly once placed in the cooler.
Subway, 1864 Highway 141, Sloan — During a Dec. 22 visit, a Siouxland District Health Department inspector noted that the food protection manager’s certification had expired in July 2025 and that “lunch meats such as turkey and chicken,” were holding at 47 degrees, too warm to ensure their safety, and had to be discarded. The cooler was taken out of service and plans were made to have it repaired so it would keep food at 41 degrees or colder. The restaurant was last inspected in June 2022, according to state records.
Good Eatin’s, 5418 Douglas Ave., Des Moines — During a Dec. 18 visit, a state inspector noted that the person in charge was unable to demonstrate proper sanitizing procedures and was not a certified food protection manager. Also, the staff was not ensuring “the proper temperatures of food received,” the inspector reported.
“Cheese observed … damaged or discolored inside clear sealed packaging,” the inspector reported, adding that the cheese in question had to be discarded, and that “soft cheese” was being stored in what the inspector called a “non-operational walk-in room.”
La Finca, 916 W. 2nd St., Davenport — During a Dec. 18 visit, a Scott County inspector noted that three pots of cooked beef were holding at 107 degrees and were being cooled down at room temperature, outside of a refrigerator.  The beef was then placed in pans and moved to a freezer. The inspector’s report also made note of an unspecified issue involving “bison,” adding that unspecified food items inside one of the coolers were being held at 51 to 54 degrees and had to be discarded.
The inspector also reported, without explaining, that cut limes and salsa were “over stocked” and were holding at 51 degrees and had to be moved to another cooler. “Several food items in coolers not date-marked,” the inspector reported. “Tamales and other food items not covered in walk-in freezer and the chest freezer… Walk-in freezer floor has excess food debris on it.”










Mouse-like droppings were observed along the interior cabinets of the fryers ... Boxes containing cans of olives and pudding were observed being stored on the floor in the kitchen.


– Inspector's report on Rudy's Tacos in Bettendorf


Rudy’s Tacos, 3111 Devil’s Glen Road, Bettendorf – During a Dec. 18 visit, a Scott County inspector reported that a container of cooked ground beef was holding on the lunch buffet line at 120 to 122 degrees, which was not hot enough to ensure safety. Because the beef had been on the buffet line for less than two hours at that point, it was reheated to 165 degrees and then returned to the buffet line.  Also, one pan of cooked ground beef was observed sitting out, unattended, on a food-preparation table and was measured at 45 degrees. The beef was returned to a cooler for holding until it was ready to be put to use.
Also, the interior of one cooler had a pool of “dark colored substance and food residue” covering the bottom; the interior drawer of the food-preparation table was marred by a buildup of crumbs, dried food debris, and grease; the interior of the ice machine had a “small accumulation of soil;” and a can of Hot Shot Flying Insect Killer, not approved for use in a commercial kitchen, was stored in the kitchen.
“Mouse-like droppings were observed along the interior cabinets of the fryers,” the inspector reported. “Boxes containing cans of olives and pudding were observed being stored on the floor in the kitchen.”
Fuse, 224 2nd Ave. NE, Dyersville — During a Dec. 17 visit, a state inspector noted that a cold-holding unit used to keep food chilled was unplugged and was storing food at 60 degrees — well above the 41-degree maximum. All of the food stored in the unit was then discarded. In addition, the house-made barbecue sauce, pasta sauce, and soup were not marked with dates to ensure freshness and safety; the house-made Caesar dressing was made with unpasteurized eggs and had to be discarded; the dishwashing machine used to sanitize dishes was reaching a temperature of only 132 degrees, and the interior of the ice machine “appeared unclean,” the inspector reported.
Izumi Japanese Steak House, 4901 Utica Ridge Road, Davenport — During a Dec. 17 visit, a Scott County inspector found that lemon juice that required refrigeration was being stored at room temperature and a bottle of liquor “had fruit flies floating in the bottle.”
Also, cooked rice stored in large containers inside the walk-in cooler was measured at 53 to 57 degrees and had to be discarded; the ice machine and fountain-drink machine each contained “debris and gunk,” and access to a kitchen handwashing sink was blocked by equipment. The walk-in cooler door, door seal, and cooler fans contained “debris and gunk,” and the hot-water handle on the kitchen handwashing sink was broken off.
Maid Rite Diner, 3708 N. Division St., Davenport — During a Dec. 17 visit, a state inspector found that a food-preparation cooler was holding items at 51 to 52 degrees, which was too warm to ensure safety. “This is a repeat violation and requires long-term corrective action,” the inspector noted. Also, there was chili that was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, and several items that were pulled from the freezer did not have the proper date markings.
In addition, “several items throughout the facility” had been held past the maximum of seven days, such as tomatoes dated Dec. 9, house-made ranch dressing dated Dec. 10, and queso dated Nov. 22.  Also, a box of dinner napkins was “stored on the ground in the back storage room near the restrooms” and the fryers had an excess buildup of grease inside them and on their tops.
Tony Roma’s, 350 Bell St., Dubuque — During a Dec. 17 visit, a city inspector made note of cheese that was not date-marked to ensure freshness and safety, tomato pasta that had a “use by” date of Dec. 14, cooked pork butt that had a “use by” date of Dec. 16, chipotle garlic butter that had a “use by” date of Dec. 16, and maple butter that had a “use by” date of Dec. 5. All of the outdated food items were then discarded.
In addition, racks inside one of the coolers were unclean and rusty, and the microwave ovens were visibly soiled. The visit was part of a preopening inspection triggered by a change in ownership.
“License not approved,” the inspector reported. As of Jan. 8, 2026, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing had yet to post any information indicating a follow-up inspection had been performed.
Mojitos Bar and Grill, 3303 S. Center St., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 16 visit, a state inspector found that gelatin desserts had been prepared in a private home and had to be removed from the food service. Also, two pans of carnitas did not have date-markings to ensure freshness and safety, and several items had been held past the maximum of seven days, including beans dated Dec. 8, chicken dated Dec. 4, ground beef dated Dec. 6, and salsa dated Nov. 30. Also, cut tomato, cooked shrimp, and octopus had no date markings.
Mandarin Café, 1117 2nd St., Perry — During a Dec. 15 visit, a state inspector noted there was no certified food protection manager on staff, and the restaurant had eggs that did not come from an approved source and had to be removed from the kitchen. Also, chicken was being stored on a food-preparation table without any temperature control, and several foods previously cooked and cooled had no dates of preparation on them. “Some foods discarded during inspection,” the inspector reported, adding that carrots and cabbage inside a mesh bag were being stored “on the ground” and several food items were stored without lids or other coverings to prevent contamination.
Haley’s Deli Barbecue and Catering, 501 N. 3rd Ave., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 15 visit, a state inspector cited this establishment for 13-risk factor violations, an exceptionally high number.
Among the issues: The person in charge was not a certified food protection manager, and several food items — including chicken and noodles, mashed potatoes, meatloaf, gravy, corn, green beans, smoked chicken pieces, rice, and various cooked meats — were not held at safe temperatures and had to be discarded. Also, the restaurant had no consistent date-marking system in place to ensure food items were fresh and safe to eat.
Included among the foods that were date-marked, but past their expiration, were baked beans dated Dec. 7, pasta salad dated Dec. 6, macaroni salad dated Dec. 5, and broccoli salad dated Nov. 27, all of which had to be discarded.
In addition, equipment and utensils that were washed in the kitchen’s three compartment sink and mechanical dishwasher were not being sanitized, and although the business had a full-service alcohol bar, it lacked the means to clean and sanitize bar ware.
The inspector also reported that the door of the cold deli case had a “buildup of mold-like residue” and said the gas-fed, open-flame rotisserie and flat-top grill that were being used lacked “any type of ventilation.”
The visit was in response to a non-illness complaint pertaining to adulterated food and food from unsafe sources. “Complaint is closed and unverifiable,” the inspector reported. According to state records, the last time the restaurant was inspected was in October 2022.
Crawford Brew Works, 3659 Devil’s Glen Road, Bettendorf – During a Dec. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 11 risk-factor violations, an unusually high number. The inspector found the restaurant did not have a certified food protection manager on staff to oversee daily operations in the kitchen. Also, a worker was seen handling raw ground beef and then, with the same gloves on, handling a hamburger bun.
In addition, two containers of whipped cream were being held at 49 degrees and had to be discarded; a pan of cooked shrimp prepared several days prior had no date markings; the interior lids, shelves, and walls of all three food-preparation coolers had a “buildup of food debris and soil” on them; there was no thin-tipped probe thermometer in the kitchen for checking the temperature of prepared food products; and a plastic serving cup sitting in a container of cooked corn within a hot-holding unit “appeared to be slowly melting” inside the container of corn.
Minh’s Gourmet, 2215 Ridgeview Drive, Davenport — During a Dec. 12 visit, a Scott County inspector reported seeing the owner touching, with his bare hands, the sweet and sour chicken that was ready to be served to a customer. The inspector intervened and the dish was discarded. Also, rice that was cooked had not cooled below 67 degrees within two hours and had to be discarded.
The restaurant was also storing sprouts at room temperature — a repeat violation the inspector said required long-term corrective action. In addition, the tempura chicken in the walk-in cooler had inaccurate date-markings on it. The owner indicated chicken was made twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and he was given the opportunity to place new date-markings on the chicken.
“Interior of the ice machine has a buildup of grime,” the inspector reported. “Interior of the walk-in cooler – the fans, walls, ceiling and racks — have an excess buildup of dust and debris.”










There is a buildup of food spills and crumbs under and around equipment in the deli area ... The floors in the deli are not clean… License is expired.


– Inspector's report on Bobby's Grocery and Barbecue in Dysart 


Bobby’s Grocery and BBQ, 305 Crisman St., Dysart — During a Dec. 11 visit, a state inspector cited this grocery store and full-service deli for operating without a license and for holding numerous foods at unsafe temperatures — including smoked sausage pasta, fried chicken, potato salad and Oreo fluff. The pasta and chicken were discarded, while the salads were moved to a colder location in the same cooler.
The inspector also reported the business did not have a date-marking system in pace to ensure food was fresh and safe to eat, and some foods had incorrect preparation and discard dates on them. Also, hard boiled eggs, pulled pork, cooked vegetables, cooled nacho cheese sauce, and fried chicken had no preparation or discard dates on them.
The inspector also found that food items that had been prepared and packaged within the store — including smoked sausage pasta, pasta salad, smoked pork roast, and fried chicken — were not labeled with ingredients or allergens.
“There is a buildup of food spills and crumbs under and around equipment in the deli area,” the inspector reported. “The floors in the deli are not clean… License is expired.”
The inspector did not approve the application for a new license, noting that a penalty fee for operating without a license would first have to be paid, and indicated a revisit would be scheduled to confirm corrective action was taken to address some of the violations that were found.
On Dec. 18, another inspection took place and the business was again cited for storing food in a retail sales case at temperatures that were unsafe. Barbecue meats, fried chicken, potato salad, coleslaw, shredded cheese and dessert salad were found to be out of temperature and were discarded. The facility’s license application was then approved.
Supermarket Villachuato, 107 N. Center St., Marshalltown — During a Dec. 9 visit, a state inspector found the person in charge was not a certified food protection manager. The business was cited for using cardboard shipping boxes as a cutting surface for vegetables; for maintaining cooked, shredded meat in a self-service hot case at temperatures of only 119 to 124 degrees; for failing to date-mark house-made salsas and packaged, cooked chickens; for offering a roasted chicken that had an expiration date of Nov. 19; and for selling house-made sauces, pasta, beans and tortillas that were packaged are not labeled with ingredients or allergens.
The visit was in response to a complaint pertaining to food from unsafe sources and cross-contamination of food items. The complaint was deemed verified.
Hotel Blackhawk, 200 E. 3rd St., Davenport — During a Dec. 3 visit, a Scott County inspector cited the hotel’s restaurant for failing to have employed a certified food protection manager with management and supervisory responsibility. In addition, the business was cited for several food items kept outside safe temperature ranges, including cooked chicken at 51 degrees, and shrimp and ground beef at 45 to 50 degrees. Other food items had expired, including cooked chorizo that was date-marked Nov. 19, and house-made sauce dated Nov. 20. The inspector also reported finding diced pineapple and mangos that were date-marked Nov. 24.
Also, excess food debris was noted in a microwave oven, a cooler, a holster for the pop-dispensing gun, and a mixer. The hood vents were “dripping grease” and the floor in the dry storage area had excess dirt and debris, the inspector reported.
Casa Tequila Mexican Restaurant, 4908 N. Pine St., Davenport — During a Nov. 25 visit, a Scott County inspector cited this establishment for 13 risk-factor violations, an exceptionally high number. Among the issues: The walk-in cooler was holding all food at a temperature of 43 to 44 degrees, rather than 41 degrees or colder; two pans of queso were left sitting out at room temperature and were measured at 52 degrees; rice prepared the previous day was not reheated to 165 degrees prior to being put on a steam table; ground beef in the walk-in cooler had not cooled to 41 degrees within six hours and had to be discarded, and rice and queso on the steam table were measured at 107 to 108 degrees and had to be reheated to 165 degrees.
Also, a basin holding raw meat was stored on the floor of the kitchen, frozen meat was being thawed by being left to sit out at room temperature, and non-food-grade plastic grocery bags with ink on them were being used to hold tortillas and to thaw meat.
Fresh Fit Meals, 11881 Hickman Road, Urbandale — During a Nov. 21 visit, a state inspector reported that packaged meals in the retail walk-in cooler were being stored above the maximum of 41 degrees, including the bison hamburger bowl at 46 to 50 degrees, and the Philly bowl at 45 degrees.
Also, the inspector reported, “dates are not transferring from prepared ingredients to prepared meals” — suggesting that the prepared meals had expiration dates that were beyond the expiration dates of some of the individual ingredients. The inspector reported discussing with management the practice of “using the oldest date of ingredients” when determining the expiration date of prepared meals.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-09 15:31:54+00:00,CT Mirror,ICE makes arrests in New Haven as pro-immigrant groups mourn Renee Good,Michayla Savitt | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/09/ice-arrests-new-haven-renee-good/,New Haven police said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested three people in the city Thursday.,"New Haven police say that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested three people in the city Thursday. The news was among a flurry of local and national immigration developments on the minds of immigrant advocates who gathered at a downtown rally later in the day.
The latest arrests show that the advocacy work is far from over, said Kica Matos with the National Immigration Law Center, who was among the rally speakers.
“They were here today in this block snatching people away in broad daylight, and it is happening everywhere,” Matos said.
Few details about the arrests were available Thursday night. ICE officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the New Haven Police Department confirmed ICE made three arrests Thursday in downtown.
A department spokesman said ICE officials did notify New Haven police of the action, but local officers were not involved in the arrests.
People at the rally also mourned the death of a Minneapolis woman who was shot and killed Wednesday by an ICE agent.
Fumika Mizuno, a volunteer with the New Haven Immigrants Coalition, led the New Haven crowd in a moment of silence to honor the life of Renee Nicole Good, a mother of three. Mizuno also included all those who have died or disappeared while in ICE custody.
After the crowd held the silence for nearly a minute, Mizuno invited people to lay flowers on the steps of the New Haven Superior Court, where a handwritten sign read: “We will not be complicit.”
“We hold rage and grief and yet we choose to be here together because we transform those into action, and through action we build hope,” Mizuno said.
“If there was ever a time for us to come together, that time is right now,” said Rev. Scott Marks, director of New Haven Rising. “And all the things that would cause us to be separate and apart, I call for solidarity.”
Other vigils were held across Connecticut, including one at an ICE field office in Hartford.
The rallies across the state came soon after Avelo Airlines announced the end of its involvement with federal deportation flights out of Arizona. The news came after months of protests at Tweed New Haven Airport, where Avelo has a significant presence, and a widespread boycott of the airline over the practice.
An Avelo spokesperson said Wednesday that the airline’s decision to end its partnership with ICE was purely financial.
Advocates said Avelo ending its contract does not mean that the group’s advocacy is done. They will keep pushing back against the Trump administration’s heightened immigration enforcement.
“We aren’t going to stop resisting until every loved one, every neighbor, and every family member is home, and we aren’t going to stop until this death machine is abolished. We will keep showing up,” Mizuno said, as the crowd cheered in response.

GLENDALE, Ariz. – Trinidad Chambliss’s last-gasp pass into the end zone, intended for De’Zhaun Stribling, had fallen incomplete. Despite several tugs of Stribling’s jersey and significant contact from a Miami defender, pass interference was not called. The State Farm Stadium scoreboard at the Fiesta Bowl showed Miami with 31 points, Ole Miss with 27. The clock showed all zeroes.
This crazy, often magical 2025 Ole Miss football season finally ended Thursday, eight days into 2026 and one victory short of playing in the national championship game. Many of the Rebel players stared at the scoreboard almost as if in disbelief. Several shed tears while embracing one another. Across the field, Miami players celebrated wildly. Some of them were crying tears of joy. This game dripped drama.

A few minutes later, quarterback Trinidad Chambliss and running back Kewan Lacy trudged off the field together, Chambliss with a towel over his head, Lacy with his arm draped over Chambliss’s shoulder.
There, to greet them in the tunnel leading to the Ole Miss locker room, was former Miami superstar and Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker Ray Lewis. Lewis had witnessed the effort the Rebels duo had put forth. Chambliss threw for 277 yards and a touchdown. Lacy, after missing time with a tweaked hamstring and then playing despite it, ran for 103 yards and another touchdown.
Lewis is one of the greatest competitors in football history and knows valor and grit when he sees it. That’s why he was outside Ole Miss’s locker room and not inside Miami’s. He wanted to console the two Rebel offensive stars who had displayed remarkable effort and grit galore. Onlookers couldn’t hear what Lewis said, but we could see he meant it.

Moments later, Lacy, Chambliss and the rest of the Rebels made their way into the locker room where Pete Golding, their head coach, greeted each and every one of them, some with handshakes, some with bear hugs. Golding appeared totally drained, bleary-eyed, exhausted. His Rebels had fought so valiantly, especially after being dominated early in the game when Miami kept the ball for 20 of the game’s first 23 minutes and held Ole Miss to a negative one yard of total offense in the first quarter.
And so Miami will go on to play for the national championship just a few miles from its campus. Ole Miss will begin to build for next year. Lacy will be back for the Rebels. Chambliss hopes to be. Many more of the Rebels who made this the longest and most memorable season in Ole Miss history will be back for another run, having shown, even in Thursday night’s defeat, they belonged on the national stage.
“I can’t tell you how proud I am of this group,” Golding would say in the post-game press conference. “They never flinched, they never panicked … This group created a legacy and an expectation for this program. We didn’t play our best and we didn’t coach our best, but I couldn’t ask any more in terms of effort. … Effort has never been an issue with these guys.”

Anyone who watched the game, no matter your allegiance, knows that, at least on this night, the better team won. Indeed, the bigger, stronger team won, often dominating the line of scrimmage. The Hurricanes possessed the ball for more than 41 of the game’s 60 minutes. Miami ran a whopping 88 plays, compared to just 60 plays for the Rebels.
Miami won the game on third and fourth downs. Ole Miss converted just two of 10 third down plays. Miami converted 11 of 19 third downs and two of two fourth down gambles. The Ole Miss defense just could not get off the field.
Still, Ole Miss, displaying the same doggedness that won the Sugar Bowl over Georgia seven days earlier, stayed in the game. Even when Miami scored the go-ahead touchdown on Carson Beck’s three-yard scramble with 18 seconds remaining, Ole Miss fired back.
Chambliss hit Cayden Lee with a 23-yard strike to near midfield. Thirteen seconds remained. After an incompletion, Chambliss completed a 17-yard laser to Stribling. That left time for one heave to the end zone. Could Chambliss, the miracle worker, do it again? At this point, would anyone have been surprised? Stribling was the target in the left corner of the end zone with heavy coverage from two Miami defenders. There tugs of Stribling’s jersey. There was contact. There was no flag.
Could have been called. Wasn’t.
“That play did not lose us the game,” Golding would say. 
The truth is: Miami, a talented, red-hot team playing its best football when it mattered most, won the game more than Ole Miss lost it. 
Beck, a 23-year-old millionaire, played almost flawlessly, throwing for 268 yards and two touchdowns and running in the game-winner. Bruising running back Mark Fletcher slammed into the line over and over, 22 times for 133 yards, often pushing the pile. Wide receiver Malachi Toney, a marvelously talented, just turned 18-year-old freshman, caught five balls for 81 yards and turned an at-first-harmless-looking quick screen into a highlight reel, 36-yard touchdown dash. Malachi Toney, remember that name. You will be hearing it for years.
Yes, and 6-foot-9 inch, 345-pound Miami left tackle Markell Bell of Cleveland, Mississippi, and Holmes Community College anchored a massive, often dominant Miami offensive line. Miami has now played 15 games. Bell has yet to give up a sack.

So, Ole Miss didn’t lose, so much as Miami won. The Rebels were heroic even in defeat. The team that lost its head coach just as preparations for the playoffs began never surrendered.
Said Golding, when asked about his team’s legacy, “I’ll just remember how they embraced one another. There’s been a lot happen over the last month to where somebody could have not been a good dude. Somebody could have not worked hard. Somebody could have not showed up on time. I can’t recall a single issue. That’s who they are. They just went to work and made sure everyone around them went to work.”
Golding continued, “But to me, I’ll remember the smiles, man. It’s the memories. It’s the laughs. It’s the camaraderie and how they grew together. They’re going to be talking about this for a long, long time right? Some of it will be about what could have happened and all that, but they’ve made memories in that locker room that will last a lifetime.”
Yes, they have. And those of us lucky enough to have witnessed it won’t forget it any time soon.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The two groups that sought to enshrine nonpartisan court races are now united behind a single ballot initiative, CI-132, put forward by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts.
The ballot initiative was one of two nearly identical constitutional initiatives launched to counter a push by Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, throughout the 2025 Legislature to make changes to the state’s judicial system, including allowing judges to run with partisan affiliation.
According to a Thursday press release, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, the group started by Ted Dick and Pepper Peterson that sponsored CI-131, announced their endorsement of CI-132.
The consolidation “signals a united effort to protect Montana voters’ 90-year right to nonpartisan judicial elections,” Dick said in a press release. “Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges believes Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts has a strong policy and the resources to ensure the initiative qualifies for the ballot, which is why we have chosen to formally endorse CI-132.”
Dick has formally requested to withdraw CI-131 with the Montana Secretary of State.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan.
The group gained endorsements from retired Montana Supreme Court Justices Mike McGrath and Pat Cotter, and lists more than 1,000 individual supporters on its website.
The text of CI-132 proposes to amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
“We know that Montanans want to protect their right to judicial elections free from the influence of political parties and politicians,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a statement. “We are proud to stand with those who have endorsed CI-131 and CI-132 and begin the work of qualifying this critical initiative for the November ballot.”
The process to get the ballot initiative before voters has already hit some bumps, including a brief legal challenge against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, whose office initially approved the ballot measure as legally sufficient, but rewrote the language of the proposed ballot statement, arguing it did not inform voters what “nonpartisan” meant.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Schwab reported $1.3 million in campaign contributions as of Dec. 31, while Democrat Ethan Corson attracted $900,000 in donations to fuel his campaign for governor.
Schwab and Corson released information on their 2025 fundraising reports ahead of the Monday deadline for submitting financial documents to the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission and Kansas Secretary of State’s office.
So far, more than a dozen candidates have announced campaigns for the Republican or Democratic party nominations for governor in Kansas. Their capacity to generate significant donations would be viewed as a measure of political viability in terms of the August primaries. In 2022, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly raised more than $7.7 million for her successful reelection campaign.
Schwab, who has served as Kansas’ secretary of state since 2019, said his campaign for governor attracted more than $1.3 million.
“These results show support for the only conservative in the race with a comprehensive plan for addressing the Kansas property tax crisis,” he said. “Kansans want a leader who will do more than share hollow rhetoric about issues, but put forth solutions that put the taxpayer first.”
Schwab’s most prominent GOP rivals include former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt. They haven’t announced fundraising totals yet.

Corson, a Democratic state senator from Johnson County, said he accepted more than 3,000 contributions and that 70% of these donations were for less than $100. He reported securing more than $900,000 since July. His rival in the primary is Sen. Cindy Holscher, also of Johnson County. She has not yet released campaign donation information.
“Our campaign is about creating a Kansas where the next generation can build a life right here, and this milestone is proof that people all across the state believe in that vision,” Corson said.
During the 2025 portion of the campaign cycle, Corson said his campaign traveled 11,000 miles to dozens of cities. He’s been endorsed by more than 10 labor unions as well as Kelly, who referred to him as “most suited” to be the next governor.
In the campaign for attorney general, Democrat Chris Mann officially filed as a candidate and said his campaign raised $536,000 in 2025. Republican Attorney General Kris Kobach said he would run for reelection but hasn’t released a summary of his campaign treasurer’s report. In 2022, Kobach received 50.8% of the vote to narrowly defeat Mann, who claimed 49.2% of ballots cast.
Mann said 89% of his 2,500 contributions came from Kansans, which he said was an indication of momentum of his second campaign for attorney general.
“Kansans want an attorney general who is focused on protecting communities, upholding the law fairly, and delivering real results, not playing politics,” Mann said. “The record level of support we’re seeing makes it clear that people are ready for a new direction in the attorney general’s office.”
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Republican from Wichita, said he generated $427,300 during 2025 for his campaign for state insurance commissioner.
He asserted the total “breaks all previous records for down-ballot races at this point in the election cycle,” comparing it to campaigns for secretary of state, state treasurer and insurance commissioner in 2014, 2018 and 2022. He didn’t acknowledge Mann’s higher total in the campaign for attorney general.

Over time, some cities have met the state’s criteria without being added to the list, while others no longer qualify yet continue to reap the benefits. Oversight of the designations seems to have been lost.","THE TERM “Gateway City” was first coined in a 2007 report published by MassINC (the nonprofit civic organization that also publishes CommonWealth Beacon) and originally described just 11 midsize cities outside of Greater Boston that were, and still are, struggling regional economic centers. These cities were major manufacturing hubs yet suffered from the same decline that beset much of the country in the decades since World War II. 
But they are also communities with assets – historic architecture, museums, universities, and walkable neighborhoods and downtowns – that make them attractive places for investment. They are home to nearly 40 percent of the state’s foreign-born residents, and for many, they are a “gateway” to the American dream.
In 2009 and 2010, Beacon Hill took note of these communities around the state and recognized the need to financially support their economic development efforts. The Legislature codified an official definition of Gateway Cities in state law and began setting aside funds to help redevelop the qualifying communities.
But despite lawmakers’ good intentions, the statute failed to create a clear enforcement mechanism to periodically review each city’s eligibility. Over time, some cities have met the state’s criteria without being added to the list, while others no longer qualify yet continue to reap the benefits. Beacon Hill hasn’t made changes to the list of qualifying cities since 2013. Since then, oversight of the designations seems to have been lost.
State statute defines a Gateway City as any city with a population greater than 35,000 but less than 250,000, a median household income below the statewide average, and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher that is below the state average. Under that definition, 24 cities originally qualified for the status under the law. But in 2013, former Gov. Deval Patrick’s administration added Attleboro and Peabody to the list after their median household incomes dipped below the statewide average, bringing the total to 26.
Today, those 26 former industrial cities continue to compete for tax credits and millions of dollars in housing and economic development funds from a number of programs that target Gateway Cities. Over the years, there have been many legislative attempts to revise the state’s eligibility criteria – none of which have been successful.

But there are three current Gateway Cities – Salem, Methuen, and Quincy – that do not qualify for the status under the state’s current criteria. Methuen’s median household income has just surpassed the state average. Data from the most recent five-year American Community Survey show that nearly 50 percent of Salem residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher – a bit more than the statewide average. In Quincy, nearly 49 percent of residents now have a bachelor’s degree or higher, just surpassing the state average.
Two cities – Weymouth and Marlborough – now meet all three criteria to be considered Gateway Cities under state statute, according to the Census Bureau’s most recent data, yet they are not reaping the benefits of the designation.
So, who is in charge of the designations? Beacon Hill doesn’t seem to know.
The statute doesn’t charge an office, department, or agency with periodically reviewing which cities meet the criteria, leaving no path for cities to be added or removed. It also doesn’t explicitly state which entity is supposed to enforce the law. However, the tax incentive program under which the legal definition of Gateway Cities was created – the Economic Development Incentive Program, which awards tax credits for job creation – is overseen by the secretary of economic development.
The Executive Office of Economic Development emphasized that it remains committed to providing funding and programs to Gateway Cities but argued that the statute does not authorize or require them to review which cities and towns meet the criteria. The office did not respond when asked if Secretary Eric Paley would rectify the situation.
State Rep. Antonio Cabral, a New Bedford Democrat who co-chairs the Gateway Cities Legislative Caucus, said even if a community meets all three criteria and wants to be considered a Gateway City, it needs to have a history of deindustrialization and should be a regional center of economic activity – even though those “requirements” are not actually written in the state law.
“Sometimes we read the so-called metrics or criteria too literally,” he said. “That historical designation is not written down in any way, but that’s part of the concept.”
It’s true that Marlborough and Weymouth meet the “letter” of the law, but when asked if they meet the “spirit” of the law, Cabral hedged.
“I think I would leave it in the form of a question. Do they think they meet that historical definition?” he said.
Cabral said he would be opposed to removing cities from the official list because they no longer meet all three criteria, arguing that it is in the state’s interest to continue investing in the development of those cities. But he also emphasized that funding for the 26 Gateway Cities is already limited, and programs like the Housing Development Incentive Program – a market-rate housing tax incentive program exclusively for Gateway Cities – are competitive enough as it is.
“My role is to make sure that we don’t keep dividing the pot. My role is to make sure that pot gets fuller,” Cabral said.
Sen. John Cronin, a Fitchburg Democrat who also chairs the Gateway Cities Legislative Caucus, had a different take.
“I am a proponent of addition,” Cronin said. “The bigger coalition that you can build of communities that are advocating together for equitable state investments, community development, and economic development benefits everybody in the state.”
Cronin argued that Quincy, Salem, and Methuen are proof that the state’s targeted grant programs and funding opportunities are working and have helped to create more mixed-income communities. In order for the definition of a Gateway City to change, or for a new city to be added, Cronin said the Legislature would need to act.
“There are more conversations happening in the Legislature now between members than I have seen in the past about whether we should increase the size or relook at what makes a Gateway City,” he said.
Cabral believes Gov. Maura Healey’s administration and the Executive Office of Economic Development are the ones in control of the policy, and legislation is not necessary. Healey’s office declined to answer questions about whether her administration would tweak the current list as former Gov. Patrick’s administration did in 2013.
All of this has left lawmakers like Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who represents Marlborough, confused. He told CommonWealth Beacon he is trying to understand how the city can officially be considered for the grants and benefits, but his questions have gone mostly unanswered.
“So far in our outreach to the Executive Office of Economic Development, there has been no point person for Gateway Cities to make this inquiry,” Eldridge said. “I’m trying to get more answers on what the Legislature plans to do on this, or the executive branch.”

Eldridge said the funding, grants, and tax incentives would be “significant” for Marlborough, which has struggled to build enough affordable housing.
Gateway Cities are eligible and prioritized for multiple state aid programs, including the Gateway Housing Rehabilitation Program, which provides funds to develop blighted residential properties, Greening the Gateway Cities, which provides grants to cities and nonprofits for tree planting, and the Transformative Development Initiative, which provides assistance and grants to support economic growth in Gateway City downtowns and commercial districts.
“There are current Gateway Cities that have become wealthier, and if the general idea is that a Gateway City is supposed to be prioritized because it’s either less well off or is unable to do the investments on its own, how does that impact the bigger discussion about how to most wisely use our taxpayer dollars?” Eldridge said.
Sen. Patrick O’Connor, a Republican who represents Weymouth, only recently realized the city meets the criteria after CommonWealth Beacon reached out. He said in an interview that he is excited about Weymouth’s eligibility, which could open the door to valuable economic development funding opportunities for the city.
“It’d be huge. We have one of the largest undeveloped parcels of land in the entire state … we also have no downtown in Weymouth,” O’Connor said. “We’re excited to learn about the process, or help in the creation of the process for that matter.” 
Recognizing that the statute is vague, O’Connor emphasized the need to “tighten up the process in which this all happens.”
“The long-term goal of the Gateway City designation is to … have growth and development inside of your community that will lead you, hopefully, to a point in time where the designation is no longer necessary,” O’Connor said.
Recently, lawmakers have raised questions and proposals seeking to define Gateway Cities in a way that encompasses more communities.
State Sen. Bill Driscoll, who represents the town of Randolph which has long hovered near the threshold of the state’s three criteria, introduced a bill in 2025 that would add two additional criteria – having a population makeup of at least 40 percent people of color and having 15 percent or more of households that speak English less than “very well.”
Municipalities meeting any three of the five categories would be considered a Gateway City. Under that definition, Randolph would qualify, but so would seven other towns and cities, including Boston and a town of less than 5,000 on the island of Martha’s Vineyard.
The bill would also charge the secretary of economic development with certifying which municipalities qualify after each decennial census and would give the office the ability to move a community on or off the list at any point mid-decade using annual estimates from the Census Bureau.
Another bill proposed in 2025 by Sen. Paul Mark – representing Berkshire County and the westernmost towns of Hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin counties – would allow two or more municipalities to combine to satisfy the first criterion, which requires a qualifying city’s population to be greater than 35,000.
The Legislature may be hesitant to add or remove cities from the list now. Two of the four most powerful people in the Massachusetts state government have ties to the Gateway Cities coalition.
Lt. Gov. Kim Driscoll was the former mayor of Salem – a city that technically no longer qualifies for the designation. And in order for legislative action to be taken, House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka would need to be on board. But the speaker appears to be in the middle of the issue – literally. His district is made up of parts of both Quincy, a city that no longer qualifies, and Weymouth, a city that does. Mariano’s office declined to comment on the matter. Spilka did not respond to a request for comment.

Lawmakers’ longstanding desire for the cities and towns they represent to be considered for the opportunities set aside for Gateway Cities is nothing new. But when the term was first coined, there was some resistance it, according to John Schneider, interim president and CEO of MassINC at the time of the 2007 report. It was first seen as a negative label for low-income, struggling cities.
Schneider developed the “Gateway City” name to describe the communities in a positive way, rather than referring to them as “third tier” or “weak market” cities. They were and still are a gateway to the American dream and the middle class, he said.
“All of a sudden, these cities were being reframed as places of opportunity, so legislators wanted to define the communities in a way that resulted in more cities being designated as Gateway Cities and benefiting from the programs that were being developed,” Schneider said.
As for the three cities that no longer meet all three criteria, some have raised concerns.
The Patriot Ledger reported in June on local objections to a zoning change in Quincy that resulted in a new developer being eligible for significant tax breaks on a large-scale residential and retail project in the city center. The zoning change qualified the projects for tax incentives through the Housing Development Incentive Program. One resident compared the proposal to welfare fraud, arguing the tax breaks were unwarranted because Quincy is no longer a Gateway City by law.
If neither Healey, the Executive Office of Economic Development, nor the Legislature acts, the current list of Gateway Cities will likely remain unchanged.
“Just speaking to the financial realities of where the state is, I think there probably would be some concern about dramatically expanding which communities have that Gateway City status,” Eldridge said.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/000statehousedome.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

The outcome will reach far beyond the state’s borders.
The trial, which will include testimony from abortion providers, Planned Parenthood leadership and anti-abortion doctors, will give an unusually detailed look at the inner-workings of abortion in Missouri, highlighting how just one or two restrictions on the procedure can greatly weaken access in a state where few providers remain.
Over the course of two weeks, the details of Missouri’s numerous abortion regulations will be under a microscope as those in favor of abortion rights argue that nearly every restriction is unconstitutional under the reproductive rights amendment and the state argues the regulations are necessary protections. 
The outcome of Missouri’s reproductive rights amendment case — which will either greatly broaden access to abortion in ways not seen in decades, or will hamper access for nearly everyone in Missouri — will reverberate far beyond the Show-Me State, said Rebecca Reingold, an associate director at the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law.

This is particularly true, she said, of states also in the process of litigating abortion access like Arizona, Michigan and Ohio.
“There is little doubt that advocates and decision-makers in other states navigating similar legal challenges are closely monitoring the litigation over Missouri’s abortion regulations,” Reingold said. “ … While state court judges are certainly not bound to follow the decisions of their peers in other states, these decisions can serve as persuasive legal authority, particularly in cases involving novel legal questions or where the relevant legal standards are evolving.” 
The result of Missouri’s lawsuit will also greatly affect the landscape of abortion access in the Midwest and the South. 
“Missouri also neighbors states with some of the harshest abortion bans in the country,” she said. “That means that the outcome of this litigation will be felt beyond the state’s geographic borders, affecting access to care not only for Missourians, but also people living in neighboring states.”
The case originated with a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Missouri the day after the November 2024 election in which voters narrowly approved broad abortion access, becoming the first state to overturn a near-total abortion ban through a vote of the people.
Maggie Olivia, a senior policy manager with Abortion Action Missouri, embraces abortion-rights supporters after the race is called in favor of Amendment 3 on Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2024, in St. Louis (Anna Spoerre/Missouri Independent).
Amy Myrick, a senior attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Missouri is a harbinger for other states attempting to secure abortion protections through constitutional changes.
“Missouri is a test case for what happens when the people have spoken and passed the constitutional amendment with the strongest possible protections, but the state still decides to stand in their way, and the courts have to decide what to do,” she said. 
Hypothetically, Myrick said, this should be an open and shut case because Missouri’s reproductive rights amendment was written with some of the strongest protections of any amendment in the country. The amendment prohibits the government from regulating abortion prior to the point of fetal viability unless “such action is justified by a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means.” 
“So if courts start upholding restrictions against these kinds of protections,” Myrick said. ‘That’s a really bad sign.”
Right now, most of the targeted regulation of abortion provider laws, known as TRAP laws, have been temporarily enjoined — or paused — until a permanent decision could be made at trial.
This includes required distribution of Missouri’s informed consent booklet prior to an abortion; a 72-hour waiting period between an initial appointment and an abortion; and abortion facility licensing requirements. The injunction allowed Planned Parenthood to begin offering in-clinic abortions last February. 
Between then and October, 80 in-clinic abortion procedures took place in Missouri across Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, according to data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. In 2023 and. 2024, there were no elective abortions performed in Missouri. A few decades ago, prior to the passage of most of Missouri’s abortion restrictions and 2022 ban, thousands of abortions were performed in the state each year. Current data shows several thousand Missourians still accessed abortion in 2024, but had to travel to Illinois or Kansas to do so.
Abortion rights returned to Missouri one year ago. Access never did

Zhang did not enjoin two regulations that Planned Parenthood says are preventing providers from prescribing medication abortion: a complication plan approved by the state as well as supplemental insurance requirement. For this reason, Missouri doctors remain unable to prescribe the medications mifepristone and misoprostol to patients to end first trimester pregnancies. Medication abortion is the most common method to end a pregnancy in the United States, used in about two-thirds of abortions.
Anti-abortion advocates contend repealing these regulations could put women’s safety at risk. 
“Like Michigan and Ohio before them, the amendment was the first step, opening the door for the abortion lobby to tear down all of the health and safety standards for women’s protections that the Missouri legislature required over the years,” said Katie Glenn Daniel, director of legal affairs and policy counsel at SBA Pro-Life America.
Myrick said attempts to tie regulations to health and safety claims are nothing new. 
“Every single one of these restrictions is about hostility to abortion, making it harder to access abortion,” she said. “Even something like a complication plan can be a shutdown law if it’s impossible to comply with. So there’s no way this is about health or safety.”
She said Missouri anti-abortion leaders have long been creative, spearheading many of the national fights against mifepristone in particular. 
Stickers saying “repeal and replace Amendment 3,” the name of the 2024 reproductive rights amendment, are distributed during Missouri Right to Life advocacy day at the Missouri State Capitol in March 2025 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
In November, Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway sued over the latest approval of a generic version of mifepristone, asking the federal government to overturn the approval and to reinstate in-person dispensing laws for the medication, which can currently be prescribed in some states during telehealth appointments and then mailed to patients.
Last summer, Hanaway’s predecessor, Andrew Bailey, sued Planned Parenthood over its claims that mifepristone is safer to take than over-the-counter medications like Tylenol, penicillin and Viagra. 
And Missouri is now the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit seeking to limit the availability of medication abortion. The case originated in Texas and moved all the way up to the United States Supreme Court before the nation’s highest court said the original plaintiffs didn’t have the jurisdiction to sue.
Sarah Wetter, senior associate with the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown Law, said the transfer of the federal case to Missouri makes the state litigation beginning Monday “all the more threatening” as the Missouri Attorney General’s Office also prepares to argue against mifepristone at the federal courthouse in St. Louis.
“Turning back the clock to pre-2016 rules would limit mifepristone access to patients up to 7 (rather than 10) weeks gestation, require more in-person visits, and otherwise prohibit telemedicine abortion,” Wetter said.
Many high-ranking Missouri politicians have shown repeatedly that abortion remains among their highest priorities, with few saying they’ll back down if the abortion rights amendment is fully implemented following the trial. A prime example of this is the Republican supermajority’s success in putting a proposed abortion ban on this year’s November ballot. Plans are already underway to continue attempting to limit access to the procedure, whether the abortion ban amendment passes or fails later this year.
Politics are supposed to be left out of the courtroom, said Michael Wolff, a former chief justice of the Missouri Supreme Court and dean emeritus at the St. Louis University School of Law. He’s curious if that will be the case next week.
“The courts, in my experience in Missouri, have always been solicitous of what the voters were voting on,” he said.
Wolff, who advised in the drafting of the abortion rights amendment, said any arguments by the state that abortion regulations are necessary because Missouri voters didn’t realize the scope of what they were voting on should be heeded cautiously.
“Haven’t these political issues, these questions about the desirability of this law, already been litigated when they had to campaign where the voters approved (abortion)?” Wolff said. “ … It’s not a matter for the courts to decide whether the voters were dumb or or smart when they did this.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_8172-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-09 10:11:44.522246

In Connecticut, a commercial driver can have their commercial driver’s license, or CDL, suspended or disqualified after a DUI arrest in any vehicle, even before a conviction. 
For CDL holders, a DUI triggers a criminal court case and an administrative action by the Department of Motor Vehicles.
Under Connecticut’s process, the DMV can suspend a CDL if a driver fails or refuses a chemical test, or if test results show an elevated blood alcohol level. In most cases, the suspension takes effect within about 45 days unless the driver requests a DMV hearing, usually within 10 to 15 days.
A BAC of 0.04% — lower than the 0.08% needed by non-commercial drivers for a DUI — while operating a commercial vehicle can lead to disqualification. Refusing a test typically results in a one-year CDL disqualification, longer if hazardous materials are involved.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Trump administration made its opinion known almost immediately after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday: The officer acted heroically in defending himself from Renee Nicole Good, who was intent on running him over with her Honda Pilot in an act of “domestic terrorism.”
“The officer, fearing for his life and other officers around him and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots. He used his training to save his own life and that of his colleagues,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a news conference in Minneapolis.
A jury might very well disagree after seeing footage of the incident, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey who called ICE’s claim of self-defense “bullsh*t.”
But the Trump administration seems intent on blocking local prosecutors from even bringing charges against the ICE officer, who the Star Tribune identified as Jonathan Ross.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office took the unusual step soon after the shooting of ousting the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation into the killing.
The BCA typically investigates police shootings in the state, and was on the scene in south Minneapolis on Wednesday collecting evidence as part of a joint investigation with the FBI.
Then the U.S. Attorney’s Office “reversed course” and decided the investigation would be led solely by the FBI, said Drew Evans, BCA superintendent, in a statement.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Gov. Tim Walz during a Thursday press conference expressed doubt about the results of any investigation conducted by the federal government because Minnesota officials have been purposefully excluded.
“Now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation, it feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome,” Walz said. “People in positions of power have already passed judgment … and told you things that are verifiably false.”
If federal investigators don’t share their findings with local prosecutors, they’ll struggle to put together a case to bring charges, said former Acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Anders Folk, who brought federal charges against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for killing George Floyd in 2020.
“I don’t know how any prosecutor could make a charging decision without facts,” Folk said. “The local authorities are going to have to figure out a way to do their own investigation if they want to be able to evaluate whether a criminal charge can be brought.”
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who has jurisdiction in Minneapolis, said in a statement on Thursday that her office is searching for a way for a state level investigation to continue.
“If the FBI is the sole investigative agency, the state will not receive the investigative findings, and our community may never learn about its contents,” Moriarty said in a statement.
The FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who will make charging decisions based on the FBI investigation, pointed the Reformer to a post on X when asked if she has commented on the case and if she believes the use of force was justified.
“Obstructing, impeding, or attacking federal law enforcement is a federal crime. So is damaging federal property. If you cross that red line, you will be arrested and prosecuted. Do not test our resolve,” the post says.
Who might do a local investigation is unclear. Folk, who is now running for Hennepin County attorney, said he’s not aware of any cases of officers shooting someone in Minnesota in which the BCA was not involved.
“They are the law enforcement organization that we as Minnesotans look to do this kind of investigative work,” Folk said.
If the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office is able to complete a criminal investigation and file charges, they face another difficult task: convincing a federal judge that the ICE officer was not acting reasonably in carrying out his lawful federal duties.
If state charges are filed, the officer will likely ask to move his case to federal court to assert immunity under what’s known as the Supremacy Clause, which protects federal officials from state criminal prosecution if they are reasonably carrying out their duties.
Whether the officer’s actions are deemed lawful could hinge on a range of facts from his training to his duties to his subjective beliefs and the U.S. Supreme Court has provided only minimal guidance on how to answer that question, according to Bryna Godar, a staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
Still, she emphasized local prosecutors can and have brought charges against federal officials.
“The baseline understanding here is that states can prosecute federal officials when they violate state criminal laws,” Godar said.
If state prosecutors convince a federal judge the officer’s actions were not reasonable, they could continue bringing the case in federal court on state crimes. That’s significant because a conviction for a state crime cannot not be pardoned by the president.
Godar points in a recent article to cases going back to antebellum, when free states charged U.S. marshals for capturing enslaved people under the Fugitive Slave Act. During the Prohibition Era, local prosecutors charged federal officers for using excessive force in shutting down distilleries.
More recently, local prosecutors in Idaho brought a charge of involuntary manslaughter against an FBI sniper who shot and killed an unarmed woman during the siege on Ruby Ridge in 1992. A divided federal appeals court ruled that the case could proceed because of disputed facts over whether the agent acted “reasonably.”
“Where we see those state prosecutions going ahead is where the use of force is deemed unreasonable or excessive or unlawful,” Godar said.
But that case may offer a cautionary tale for Minnesota: The case wasn’t allowed to proceed until 2001, nearly a decade later. Then the case was dropped by the newly elected prosecutor.
Good’s killing was the ninth shooting by an immigration officer in just the past four months and at least the second killing, with all of them involving firing at people in vehicles, according to a New York Times report. On Thursday, ICE agents shot two more people in Portland, Ore.
In each of the recent ICE shootings, the government has claimed the officer was acting in self-defense.
A 2024 investigation by The Trace and Business Insider found in 23 fatal shootings by ICE officers from 2015 to 2021, no officers were indicted.
Minnesota prosecutors have won convictions in recent years against officers for killing people in the line of duty — Chauvin, Kim Potter and Mohamed Noor — but they are rare and juries are generally reluctant to convict.
Yet even if a conviction seems unlikely, filing charges allows local prosecutors to register a strong protest against ICE’s aggressive enforcement actions in the state and communicate that officers may not operate with impunity. Not charging would be an admission that federal agents are immune from local accountability as the Trump administration pushes for mass deportation.
Folk said a transparent investigation with clear standards is also important for the public’s faith in the justice system
“Minnesota has seen firsthand how important it is to do these high-profile investigations the right way,” Folk said. “We deserve a good, thorough investigation, free of any kind of influence.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260107_871-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 09:59:01.176377

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, joined four other Republicans and the Senate’s Democrats in a 52-47 procedural vote that advances the resolution. If adopted, the resolution would direct the “removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.”
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was among the 47 senators, all Republicans, who voted against moving the resolution from committee and to the Senate floor. 
Both Murkowski and Sullivan supported President Donald Trump’s decision to launch an attack on Venezuela that seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.
The country’s interior minister said Wednesday that 100 people were killed in the attack. Seven U.S. soldiers were injured, according to the Defense Department. Maduro and his wife appeared in U.S. court on Monday.
Since the attack, Trump has said he intends to take over the nation’s oil industry and direct Venezuela’s government.
In an interview with the New York Times on Wednesday, Trump said the only limit on his international powers is his “own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me.”
In a statement after Thursday’s vote, Murkowski said that only congressional authorization could permit American troops to remain in Venezuela.
She reiterated her support for the raid that removed Maduro, saying “Venezuela — along with the world — is better off without him in power.”
Many nations officially view Maduro as a dictator.
But Murkowski also said that the United States must have a “clear and achievable end goal” for the country after Maduro’s departure.
“Any future use of force or significant policy shift in Venezuela must include robust congressional oversight and authorization, consistent with our constitutional responsibilities, the rule of law, and a clear assessment of the benefits to the American people,” Murkowski said.
In December, Sullivan told the Huffington Post that he didn’t think having troops on the ground in Venezuela was a good idea.
If the resolution were enacted, the United States would be unable to legally have troops on the ground without congressional approval.  
He did not have a public comment on his vote Thursday, and a spokesperson referred to a statement he made Jan. 3, after the attack that ended with Maduro’s capture.
“The lessons learned from what took place after the United States deposed another Latin American indicted drug lord — Panama’s Manuel Noriega in 1989 — could prove useful, as could the painful and difficult lessons learned after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003,” that statement said in part.

The state owes her business, Rising Sun Learning Center, around $49,000 in payments as part of a subsidy program that reimburses child care providers who serve low-income and foster children.
Invoices for December appear to be at a standstill, and state officials haven’t given her an estimated payment date. And Huffman is not alone.

Missouri is waiting on $25.7 million from the federal government that was supposed to be paid in December. With invoices unfulfilled and little explanation from state officials, day care operators are concerned about the stability of the subsidy program.
“So many people are saying, ‘I can’t keep my doors open and this (inconsistency) still be a thing.’ So a lot of people are just jumping ship from subsidies,” Huffman told The Independent. “At this point, I can’t really blame them.”
Missouri families must earn no more than 150% of the federal poverty level to qualify for a full benefit. In 2025, that was $48,225 for a family of four. Families earning up to 215% of the federal poverty rate can qualify to pay for child care on a sliding scale.
State lawmakers and Gov. Mike Kehoe approved a budget of $286 million in state and federal funding to run the program this fiscal year, along with an increased subsidy rate. More than 90% of the program’s funding comes from the U.S. Administration of Children and Families’s Child Care and Development Block Grant.
Huffman, a former case worker, has watched foster families struggle to find a day care that accepts subsidized students. The subsidy comes with extra obstacles and required training, and these sort of hiccups only further the frustration.
“When it comes down to either you get off the program and actually get paid and your business survives or you help those people, that’s an impossible choice for a lot of these childcare providers,” she said. “We are in (child care) to help kids and families, but we have to be able to function and keep our doors open in order to be able to help anybody.”
The reason for the delay is unclear and as invoices sit unpaid, day care operators are becoming increasingly anxious.
The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s Office of Childhood told providers Wednesday that it is “communicating with federal stakeholders” and that it “believes payments are being delayed due to the holidays and scheduled maintenance of the payment management system.”
But the agency doesn’t know with certainty what is causing the pause because the federal government has not communicated with the state. And it is not just Missouri that has been impacted, as payments appear at a standstill nationwide according to advocacy group Child Care Aware of America.
The federal fund drew national attention after a video posted in December by a right-wing social media influencer alleged that Somali-run child care providers in Minnesota were collecting money for day cares that weren’t serving any children. Minnesota state inspectors have since reported that daycares in the video are operating normally.
The allegations led to a freeze in payments for five states — all with Democrat-led governments— and a nationwide policy requiring states to justify their child care expenses.
“Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,” U.S. Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill said in a social media post.
Payment backlog leaves Missouri child care providers desperate, on the brink of closing

Casey Hanson, deputy director at Kids Win Missouri, said that while child care providers in the state have experienced payment delays before, announcements from Washington about child care have formed a “confusing rapid fire.”
Providers operating on tight margins can’t always afford delayed payments, which directly impacts children and families, she told The Independent.
“If providers don’t get paid, they’re going to start closing their doors, and families and children aren’t going to be able to access care,” Hanson said.
This is exactly what happened when the state changed software providers to manage the subsidy payments in December of 2023. Day cares shuttered as the state racked up a backlog of missed payments that was not 100% cleared until last February.
The strain of the backlog is still felt today, and some providers are revisiting the idea of stopping service to families who use the subsidy program.
“(Disruption) closes our doors,” Huffman said. “Most of us are on laser-thin budgets… So I can make payroll tomorrow, but the next one is getting questionable.”

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) A 2025 report on osprey nests, compiled by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, shows a record year of observations for the species which was virtually nonexistent in the state prior to reintroduction efforts in 1997. 
The nest monitoring program is primarily facilitated by volunteers who observe the nests several times during breeding and nesting season to determine if the nest was successful in fledging young osprey. 
According to the latest report, 20 additional nests were monitored in 2025 than in 2024. In total, Iowans monitored 70 osprey nests in 2025 – 54 of which were active nests. In 2024, the state monitored 39 active nests. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2025, 30 nests were deemed successful, meaning at least one young bird survived to the age of being able to fly, compared to 25 successful nests in 2024. 
The report said the growing number of nests show that osprey populations have increased in Iowa and so has nest reporting. 
Ospreys are large birds that feed on fish, making them an indicator of stream and fish health. The birds have white underbellies with dark markings on their wings and around their eyes. The bird is also unique for its ability to close its nostrils when underwater, which aids in its ability to hunt for fish. 
Osprey populations declined in the U.S. with the popularization of the chemical DDT in the 1950s, according to DNR. While populations rebounded slightly following the ban of DDT in the 1970s, the birds had to be reintroduced to Iowa. 
From 1997 until 2016, juvenile birds were relocated from Minnesota and Wisconsin to strategic locations in Iowa. Now, ospreys return to Iowa to breed each year and the populations, according to observations from DNR, continue to increase. 
Ospreys have a strong, recorded presence around Des Moines, in Black Hawk County, Dickinson County, Linn County and Johnson County, with some monitored nests on the state’s western edge. 
According to the report, the new nests recorded this year were primarily around the Des Moines metropolitan area and in Black Hawk County near the Cedar Falls-Waterloo area.
While there were more overall nests monitored in 2025, the ratio of successful nests, at 56%, declined from 2024 when 64% of nests were successful. 
Despite a lower success rate, the overall number of young ospreys that fledged increased from 47 in 2024 to 58 in 2025. Those figures are significantly higher than the observed survivals in 2021 through 2023, when an average of 29 young ospreys fledged. 
Of the observed nests, 12, or 22%, had an unknown outcome, which is slightly lower than the percent of nests with an unknown outcome from 2024. 
DNR, in the report, thanked the volunteers for their reporting and said the department will work to continue improving the figure in the future. 
Osprey nests are typically located on tall structures – more than 80% of active nests in 2025 were on cellular towers. Iowans who spot an osprey nest in their area and are interested in helping to monitor the nest can contact DNR’s volunteer wildlife monitoring program.

Gov. Gavin Newsom will deliver his preliminary state spending plan today — his final budget proposal as California’s governor. On his plate: A projected $18 billion budget gap for 2026-27; the loss of some federal funding; and continued economic uncertainty under President Donald Trump.
During his State of the State address Thursday, the governor dropped hints about his budget, including “significant investments in public education” that entails fully funding the state’s universal transitional kindergarten program, an additional $1 billion to expand high-need schools and more than $27,400 investment per student. (In 2022–23, the state spent about $20,500 per pupil, or $2,800 more than the national average of nearly $17,700).
Newsom also plans to overhaul how California’s schools are run: The governor-appointed, 11-member State Board of Education would take over the California Department of Education, writes CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones. This would give the governor more influence over the education system. Currently, schools sometimes get conflicting messages on how students should be taught, and this change could lead to kids getting more consistent instruction.
The governor also addressed California’s housing shortage during his speech, arguing that investors are “snatching up homes by the hundreds and thousands at a time, crushing the dream of home ownership.” 
It’s a sentiment Newsom shares with Trump, report CalMatters’ Ben Christopher and Jeanne Kuang. Though details remain scant for now, Newsom’s administration plans to work with the Legislature to curb housing ownership by corporate landlords. But some evidence suggests that the issue is overblown: Companies that own at least 10 properties own fewer than 3% of all single-family homes in California.
More specifics about how Newsom wants to fund education and housing will likely be revealed in today’s budget plan, as well as homelessness and mental health services and Medi-Cal. As Jeanne explains, the governor presented an optimistic financial outlook during his State of the State, saying that revenues came in $42 billion higher than expected.
These gains could help Newsom avoid conflict with Democratic lawmakers over program cuts during budget negotiations, though progressives said they’ll continue to push for new taxes — such as a proposed “billionaires tax” that Newsom opposes — to counteract federal cuts.

Faculty diversity still lacking in academia

Though the number of Latino college students is growing at a faster clip, the number of Latino faculty members who can help mentor these students remains lacking, write Angel Corzo and Brittany Oceguera of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network.
All but one of California State University’s 22 campuses have at least 25% of full-time Latino undergraduate students. Yet, as of fall 2024, only 15% of Cal State instructors are Latino. To reach parity with the number of Latino students, the university system would need to hire more than 13,000 Latino educators.
A spokesperson for Cal State cites low national numbers of Latinos entering graduate programs for the lack of Latinos in academia. Faculty members also argue that limited mentorship and low promotion of programs that help Latinos earn doctoral degrees act as barriers.
As a result, Latino educators — who oftentimes are in non-tenured positions with lower pay — find themselves taking on more mentorship tasks.

Dirk Horn, a Latino political science lecturer at Cal State Bakersfield: “There’s a lot of cultural taxation. That’s the biggest problem with a lack of diversity in higher education, the diverse faculty take on more work.”

These organizations can help with post-fire soil testing

Modern houses are brimming with synthetic chemicals and materials that can be found in numerous possessions such as electronics, furniture and cookware. When flames consume homes, remnants of these chemicals, metals and plastics are released in the air or settle in the soil. 
But in the aftermath of the Palisades and Eaton fires a year ago, no federal- or state-sponsored soil testing took place, reports Katharine Gammon for CalMatters. Instead, other organizations have been forced to step in.
Los Angeles County Public Health, for example, set aside as much as $3 million to fund free soil lead testing for residents living near the wildfires’ burn areas. CAP.LA, funded by the R&S Kayne foundation, connects people with free soil and water testing. The University of Southern California also launched a soil testing program known as USC Clean.

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)“Do we spend the money when they’re so young so they have the chance to become good productive citizens, or do we spend it on them in juvenile correction facilities or adult prisons? I am convinced from all the research that one way or the other, we will spend the money.”
The above quote comes from a 1999 letter by South Dakota Gov. Bill Janklow to a Belle Fourche resident. Earlier that year, during his State of the State speech, Janklow announced his administration would study whether to recommend state funding for preschool.
Today, South Dakota is one of six states without a state-funded preschool program. The state’s prison population has grown by 56% since 1999, and in 2025, the Prison Policy Initiative reported that South Dakota incarcerates women at a rate higher than any other state or country.
This trend stuffed the state’s correctional facilities, leading to overcrowding that state officials could no longer ignore. For the past five years, the state has pooled surplus COVID-19 stimulus dollars and other revenue to fund two new prisons: a women’s prison in Rapid City, and a men’s prison in Sioux Falls. The combined price tag is nearly $750 million.
South Dakota lawmakers approve $650 million prison construction project in Sioux Falls

Since 1999, lawmakers have tried to slow the growth of the prison population — including with the legislative adoption of a 2013 criminal justice reform package that shifted the state’s focus more toward parole for nonviolent offenders.
Those efforts continue today with a state task force looking closer at ways to rehabilitate people in prison and prevent them from committing more crimes after their release.
One approach the state has yet to try is a state-funded preschool program.
According to a study in Chicago, children who attended preschool had a 25% reduced rate of felony arrests as adults.
At the end of fiscal year 2025, there were 350 people incarcerated in South Dakota’s prison system who were 24 or younger. The average cost per offender per day was $93.26. Had the state committed funding to preschool when Janklow considered it in 1999, that number could be more like 262 — a reduction of 88 inmates and a savings of just under $3 million annually. That’s money that could be used elsewhere.
The savings would grow with time. One of the many reasons Rapid City took steps to become an early learner community in the early 2010s was to reduce interactions with law enforcement.
Preschool can be part of the solution to the state’s prison population problem. Molding minds at a young age also comes with other benefits, including increased school readiness, better K-12 performance and graduation rates, and better health.
In 1999, Janklow estimated 12,000 children would benefit from state-sponsored preschool. Looking at average enrollment for each K-12 grade in South Dakota schools, it’s likely that number would be the same today. Since 90% of brain development occurs in the first five years, early childhood development is one of the best investments societies can make. For every dollar invested in preschool, the return is anywhere from 7% to 20%.
Since 2023, the John T. Vucurevich Foundation has invested nearly $6 million in early learning initiatives in Rapid City — from child care assistance to afterschool programs.
We encourage our leaders to look at the state’s incarceration issue upstream. Because, as Janklow wrote in his 1999 letter, “our children’s good beginnings are our good future.”
“In my opinion, we can’t wait any longer.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2026-01-09 13:40:04+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Amid severe weather, Massachusetts must invest in protecting nature for all","David O'Neill, Kris Sarri, Katie Theoharides and Jodi Valenta",,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/amid-severe-weather-massachusetts-must-invest-in-protecting-nature-for-all/,"Trees, parks, and green spaces are not just nice to have—they are critical, low-cost infrastructure that provide nature-based solutions to bolster climate resilience.","MASSACHUSETTS IS IN a new era of severe weather and damaging storms. Flash floods in Leominster and the Berkshires, extreme heat in Boston, rising sea levels along the coast, and prolonged droughts are no longer rare events—they are our new reality. And their impacts are not felt equally. To protect all Massachusetts residents from these impacts of climate change — regardless of ZIP code— we must do more as a state to protect our rivers, lakes, forests, farms, and other natural areas.
That is why the Nature for Massachusetts Coalition, representing more than 95 conservation, environmental justice, and community organizations, along with members of the outdoor industry, are urging the Legislature to pass the Nature for All bill (H 901/S 2571) this session.
The Nature for All bill, which would dedicate funds from the existing state sales tax on sporting goods to raise $100 million every year for protecting and conserving water and nature, is our coalition’s top priority. While a parallel ballot initiative reflects growing public support, the fastest and most effective path forward is legislative action. The bill is the perfect complement to the climate resiliency investments proposed by the Healey administration in their MassReady Act. We urge lawmakers: don’t wait.
Trees, parks, and green spaces are not just nice to have—they are critical, low-cost infrastructure that provide nature-based solutions to bolster climate resilience. They cool our cities, absorb stormwater, and improve public health and access to safe drinking water. But access is unequal, and without a coordinated approach, the gap will only grow.  
The Nature for All bill would help level the playing field by identifying communities most in need of green space and climate resilience and supporting them with state funding to protect and restore that green space. It would enable smart investments in parks, greenways, and nature-based solutions all across the state, with community input at the center.
Climate resiliency isn’t the only issue this legislation addresses. It also will improve access to parks and green space. More than 1.5 million people in Massachusetts—including 300,000 children—lack access to a park or natural area within a 10-minute walk of home. These are often the same neighborhoods facing the worst effects of severe weather: heat islands, flood risk, and polluted runoff.
We’ve already seen efforts to change this work in practice.
In Boston, Trust for Public Land, Boston Parks and Recreation Department, and Boston Public Schools partnered with students at the Chittick Elementary School in Hyde Park and residents of the surrounding community to redesign a deteriorating and flood-prone schoolyard. Using green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, it was transformed into a renovated, safe, climate-resilient schoolyard and public park that mitigates the heat island effect and manages stormwater runoff, while closing a gap in park access for surrounding neighborhoods.
In Chelsea, GreenRoots, The Neighborhood Developers, and Mass Audubon are working together to acquire 18 acres of waterfront property and transform it into a broadly accessible, climate-resilient park, mixed-income housing, and community amenities along the Chelsea Creek waterfront. 
The Nature Conservancy is helping coastal communities adapt to climate change. With Massachusetts ranking third nationally in affordable housing at risk from coastal flooding, every dollar spent on climate resilience counts and can reduce future damages, protect people, and cut carbon emissions.
North of Boston, The Trustees is restoring thousands of acres of salt marsh in the Great Marsh, along the coast in Essex County. Along with numerous partners, The Trustees is remediating the marshland to help it adapt to sea level rise and bolster its ability to store carbon. This will help reduce storm surge and flood risk to uplands while also enhancing habitat for several wildlife species that rely on the marsh, including the saltmarsh sparrow.
The Nature for All bill builds upon these successes—and brings statewide coordination, resources, and urgency to address these dire needs.
The climate crisis demands more than reactive measures—it calls for bold action. That is why state Sen. Paul Feeney and state Reps. Natalie Blais and Samantha Montaño are leading the sponsorship of the bill, joined by bipartisan support from 52 members of the Legislature.
Managing the impacts of climate change is interconnected with the Commonwealth’s goals for health care, housing, food security, climate change, and land and water conservation. These efforts should be integrated and aligned to avoid conflicts and enable progress. Passing the Nature for All bill now will reduce harm from extreme heat and flooding; improve health and quality of life, create more resilient communities, and ensure every resident—no matter their ZIP code—has access to the joy and benefits of nature.
Massachusetts has been an environmental leader before. We built the nation’s first public park, and our forests, beaches, and parks are part of what makes Massachusetts a great place to live.
The cost of inaction is increasing. Let’s lead again—by investing in nature and protecting those most at risk from extreme weather.

Zella Knight is a fire survivor and community advocate from Altadena


By the time my parents made a home in Altadena, they had already survived the Jim Crow South.  They had carried with them an understanding that for Black families, safety, property and opportunity are never guaranteed.
Homeownership for them was not simply a personal achievement; it was an act of repair.  It was a way of claiming dignity in a country that had long denied Black families the right to build, keep and pass down stability.
Our home stood for decades. It held birthdays and celebrations of life, holidays and ordinary moments of care. It was a gathering place for family and neighbors, a refuge from a world that still too often devalues Black and Brown Life.  It was meant to be an inheritance — a rare form of generational wealth in a nation where Black families have been systematically excluded from wealth-building opportunities.
Then came the Eaton fire. In a single catastrophic event, the house was destroyed.  
The most devastating loss was not material. My younger brother, who lived there, through displacement was traumatized and later died. His life and the future my parents worked to secure for him and his siblings was taken from us.
Disasters are often described as equalizers.  Fires, floods and wind do not discriminate.  But that framing ignores history.  It ignores how racial injustice shapes vulnerability, loss and recovery long before disaster strikes.  
For Black and Brown families, catastrophe does not arrive on neutral ground.
Property loss in Black and Brown communities has never been accidental. From redlining and racial covenants, gentrification and discriminatory lending, insurance practices and disaster recovery systems — Black homeownership has been consistently undermined.
When a fire destroys a Black family’s home, it compounds generations of dispossession. What is lost is not only a structure, but equity built over decades in a system that never made it easy.  What disappears are irreplaceable records of survival, photographs, documents, heirlooms and too often lives.
The weight of earlier losses
Grief in Black families is rarely singular. It accumulates. It carries the weight of earlier losses that were never fully mourned because survival required moving forward.
The fire reopened wounds my parents carried from the South — the persistent knowledge that even when you do everything “right” safety can still be taken.  
This is why intergenerational healing is not an abstract or academic concept. For families like mine, it is a necessity. Healing begins with truthtelling — naming how racism magnifies disaster, how Black families are more likely to be underinsured, displaced for longer periods and offered fewer recovery resources. It also requires refusing to privatize grief when systemic failures are involved.
My parents believed deeply in community because community was how they survived Jim Crow.  That belief carried us through the aftermath of the fire. 
Neighbors, friends, acquaintances, strangers showed up not just with condolences, but with care. That relational support is a form of wealth rarely acknowledged in policy discussions, yet it is often the difference between despair and survival. 
Still, community resilience cannot substitute for institutional responsibility.
If racial justice is to mean more than rhetoric, it must address what disasters reveal. Why are Black families more likely to lose generational wealth in catastrophes?  Why is recovery slower and more bureaucratic for communities shaped by historic disinvestment? Why are families expected to be endlessly “resilient” without repair?
Intergenerational healing requires policy responses that acknowledge history. It requires equitable disaster aid, fair insurance practices, protections for inherited property, culturally competent mental health services and reimagining programs so they don’t displace families from communities they helped build. 
The Eaton Fire took a home. Displacement took a life and shattered dreams. But these did not erase the legacy my parents built — a commitment to dignity, community and truth. 
Intergenerational healing is not forgetting what was taken. It is about refusing to allow that loss to be normalized.
If we want a future where Black and Brown families can truly build and pass down stability, racial justice must extend to how we prepare for, respond to and recover from catastrophe. Anything less ensures that fires like ours will continue to burn through generations.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_35.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-09 08:58:31.513534

Stacy Korsgaden
Stacy Korsgaden, who is running for Insurance Commissioner,  owns an  insurance and financial services agency.


With the first anniversary of the devastating Southern California wildfires approaching, CalMatters asked candidates for the 2026 state Insurance Commissioner race to share thoughts on what the state can do to help victims and stabilize insurers. This is the third response. Read the other candidate responses here and here.
California is facing an insurance crisis that threatens the financial security of families, homeowners, and small businesses across the state. 
Coverage is becoming harder to obtain, premiums are rising, and policy cancellations are increasing. These developments are understandably alarming. But the good news: There is hope.
I have been a licensed insurance professional since 1988, and with close to 40 years of experience I can tell you, insurance is not merely a financial product, it is a promise. It is a cornerstone of economic stability that allows families to recover from tragedy and businesses to survive unforeseen loss. That system has served California well for generations. It can do so again.
Throughout my career as an insurance agent and business owner, my work began long before a claim was ever filed. The most important service we provided was preparation, making sure clients were properly protected before disaster struck. When the unthinkable did occur, being present to guide them through recovery was both a responsibility and a privilege. That is the role insurance is meant to play in society.
So how did we arrive at a moment where insurers are pulling back, denying coverage, or leaving entire markets? The answer is not sudden greed or indifference. It is the result of decades of accumulating regulations, rigid price controls, insufficient wildfire prevention and mitigation, and other unmanaged risk factors that have steadily eroded the system’s stability.
Insurance is fundamentally about pricing risk accurately. When that process is constrained, insurers cannot reliably operate. The result is exactly what Californians are experiencing now: reduced availability, deteriorating service, fewer choices for consumers and escalating prices.
Customers are angry and confused. Agents are left without options for their clients. Insurers face mounting losses. Meanwhile, political finger pointing has replaced serious discussion, and trust in the system continues to erode.
California does not need to choose between consumer protection and a functioning insurance market. We can have both. Achieving that balance requires a recommitment to basic principles: Free markets, actuarial soundness, California managing wildfire risks and allowing private sector innovations.
Insurance thrives on predictability and trust. When those elements are restored, capital returns, coverage expands and our working families benefit from greater choice and better service.
When a functioning free market is restored in California, capital will return and support the growth of insurers willing to serve the state. Renewed competition will naturally reduce dependence on the FAIR Plan and allow for its depopulation.
The FAIR Plan was never intended to insure the many. It was designed as a last resort option for a limited number of high risk properties. Its long-term stability depends on removing the excess burden created by the absence of a competitive private market.
As insurers are once again able to grow and write policies in California, coverage will shift back where it belongs, into the private market, restoring balance and choice for our community.
The insurance industry has long been a quiet but essential pillar of our economy. With truth, discipline, and hard work it can be again. This crisis is fixable.

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — This year’s annual King Day at the Dome will feature a first: The flag of South Carolina’s only public historically Black university will fly atop the Statehouse as people gather below to honor Martin Luther King Jr.
The main speaker from the Statehouse steps Jan. 19 will be New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Others include California Rep. Ro Khanna and Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison of Columbia, who delivered last year’s keynote speech, according to the NAACP’s state chapter, which organizes the annual event.
Above them, from sunrise to sunset, the flag of South Carolina State University will fly just under the U.S. and state flags. The unfurling officially celebrates the Bulldogs’ 40-38 fourth-overtime victory at last month’s Celebration Bowl, which made them national football champions for historically Black colleges and universities.
The flag-flying honor is definitely a first for South Carolina State, according to the college. It’s believed to be the first time any HBCU flag has flown from the dome.
The timing on MLK Day magnifies the meaning: 26 years ago, the NAACP organized the first King Day at the Dome to protest the Confederate flag flying in the same spot.
Rep. Hamiton Grant called the recognition of his alma mater, by order of GOP Gov. Henry McMaster, a symbol of unity across political differences.
“I think that should send a message to the people of South Carolina that we tend to agree more than we disagree,” the Columbia Democrat told the SC Daily Gazette. “Our history as a school, our history as a people and what we mean to the state, is something everyone should be proud of.”
Grant said college officials requested the Jan. 19 date.
He and Sen. Deon Tedder, also a South Carolina State graduate, will jointly present the flag to the Bulldogs football team in Orangeburg during its celebratory parade days later, Tedder wrote in his Dec. 19 letter to McMaster.

SC State flag request 
“It will be my honor,” McMaster wrote back about having the flag flown on MLK Day.
South Carolina State’s Dec. 13 victory in Atlanta over Prairie View A&M marked the Bulldogs’ second national HBCU championship title and third appearance at the Celebration Bowl in five years. They beat Jackson State 31-10 in 2021 to take the title.
It’s become tradition for a college flag to fly on the dome following a national championship. But lawmakers didn’t make a flag request following the Bulldogs’ 2021 win, Grant said.
Last month’s win, which avenged the Bulldogs’ 28-7 loss to Jackson State a year earlier, was dubbed by HBCU Gameday “one of the most dramatic finishes in HBCU football history.”
“This championship represents more than an athletic triumph; it is a moment of pride for the entire state of South Carolina,” Tedder, D-North Charleston, wrote Dec. 15 in his initial letter to McMaster that didn’t seek a specific date for the flag’s flying. “It celebrates the dedication of student-athletes, coaches, alumni, and supporters whose collective efforts embody excellence, resilience, and unity.”
King Day speakers
This year’s theme for King Day at the Dome is “The Time is Now.”
The event starts at 8 a.m. at Zion Baptist Church on Washington Street. Around 10 a.m., participants will walk the half-mile to the Statehouse for speeches.
Unlike in 2024, when then-Vice President Kamala Harris was the main speaker, there won’t be any metal detectors that people have to walk through. The extra layers of security for her attendance created a bottleneck for the crowd to get from Main Street to the Statehouse lawn.
The event celebrating King’s legacy has become a must-attend event for Democratic presidential candidates courting the support of Black voters in this early primary state.
In 2020, Joe Biden was among eight White House hopefuls marching arm in arm from the church to the Statehouse. They did not include Booker, who was instead at his Columbia campaign office thanking staff after dropping out of the race a week earlier.
This year, Booker will give the keynote address. Last spring, he broke the record for talking the longest on the U.S. Senate floor. His speech, at more than 25 hours, surpassed the 24-hour record set in 1957 by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, then a Democrat, as he filibustered civil rights legislation.
But Booker’s selection is not a sign of any future endorsement, should he decide to run again in 2028.
He’s giving the speech because he was the first person to reach out and ask, said Brenda Murphy, the state NAACP president.
Khanna, who represents a California district in the San Francisco Bay known as Silicon Valley, will also speak. Last July, he was in South Carolina for a four-day swing to rally opposition to the Trump administration. In Goose Creek, his “Benefits Over Billionaires” town hall instead showed Democrats’ frustrations with their own party, The Post and Courier reported.
It’s been over a decade since a Confederate flag flew over the event.
The flag came off the dome six months after the inaugural King Day at the Dome. The 2000 legislative compromise that took it down made both MLK Day and Confederate Memorial Day state holidays. It also put a smaller, square version of the battle flag on a 30-foot pole beside the Confederate monument on the Statehouse’s front lawn. Its prominent place along Columbia’s main thoroughfare made the flag more visible than it had been before.
The NAACP continued to call for the flag’s total removal from Statehouse grounds, and speakers pointed to the flag during the annual event.
But lawmakers refused to revisit the issue until 2015, after an avowed white supremacist gunned down nine people at Charleston’s historic Emanual African Methodist Episcopal Church, known as Mother Emanuel. Less than a month after the shooting, the flag and the pole it flew on were taken down. The law passed by the Legislature to do so sent the flag to a state museum.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Statehouse-dome-with-flags-1024x632.jpg,,,2026-01-09 09:12:13.687278
,California,2026-01-09 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom touts billions in new revenue but skips his own budget release,Yue Stella Yu,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2026/01/california-newsom-last-state-budget/,"The governor made rosy projections and dropped big revenue numbers in his speech Thursday. Here’s what he said, and didn’t say, about California’s fiscal future.","In summary
The governor made rosy projections and dropped big revenue numbers in his speech Thursday. Here’s what he said, and didn’t say, about California’s fiscal future.


Gov. Gavin Newsom painted a rosy picture of California’s fiscal future during his State of the State address Thursday. Flashing top-line numbers, the Democratic governor touted billions of  dollars more in revenue, proposed new investments in education and pledged more toward the state’s reserves and pension debt.
But that was a one-sided story. 
It’s not clear whether Newsom will forecast a budget deficit for the 2026-27 fiscal year, how big it will be and whether closing the gap would require painful spending cuts to core services like child care, food assistance and Medi-Cal, the state’s health care coverage for low-income residents, especially as federal funding diminishes. 
Yet Newsom will be absent from his last annual budget proposal presentation Friday, when details of his spending plan will be unveiled, leaving his Department of Finance Director Joe Stephenshaw and Chief Deputy Director of Budgets Erika Li to field those questions.
Newsom’s forecast will likely be far sunnier than the grim outlook by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office, which in November projected an $18 billion deficit despite higher-than-expected tax revenue thanks to a booming AI industry. A shortfall of that size would require long-term fixes, although state leaders had relied on Band-Aids such as accounting maneuvers, internal borrowing and withdrawals from the state’s reserves to balance the books in past years.
But according to Newsom, California will have a $248.3 billion general fund next year — $13 billion higher  than his office predicted in June. 
Newsom also touted Thursday that the state would have $42.3 billion more in revenue than forecast last year. But that figure is for a three-year span, state Department of Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer told CalMatters. 
The omission of the cumulative nature of the $42 billion makes Newsom’s speech “troubling,” said Sen. Roger Niello, a Roseville Republican and vice chair of the Senate Budget Committee.
“That would be an intentional misrepresentation of the fact,” he said.
Nonetheless, Newsom teased multiple new proposals with unknown price tags or timelines, such as fully funding the state’s universal transitional kindergarten program and providing universal before and after-school programs at elementary schools. He also proposed spending $1 billion to add high-need community schools and redirecting $1 billion in Proposition 1 mental health funds annually for housing and homelessness.
The governor briefly nodded to “long-term structural challenges,” proposing a $7.3 billion deposit to the reserve fund, roughly the amount the state withdrew last year, whichwould bring the rainy day fund balance to roughly $21 billion. He also proposed to spend $11.8 billion over the next few years to pay down the state’s pension debt, including $3 billion in next year’s budget. 
Some Democratic lawmakers struck a cautious tone while largely blaming President Donald Trump for withholding funds from Californians in need. 
“California will not be able to fill the holes that have been left by the federal government,” said newly elected Senate President Pro Tem Monique Limón, a Santa Barbara Democrat. “We have to go back and look (at) what is feasible.”
‘How big is the bubble?’Senate Budget Committee Chair John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat
Sen. John Laird, a Santa Cruz Democrat and the new chair of the Senate Budget Committee, warned that the high revenue projection indicates a bubble. Laird, who was elected to the state Assembly in 2002 after the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, said he’s concerned the AI-driven boom may not last. 
“I think everybody agrees that this level of revenue can’t be maintained, but how big is the bubble? That’s probably the question,” he told CalMatters.
The Legislature must start chipping away at the long-term structural deficit this year instead of punting the problem, he said.
“We’re gonna have to do a piece of it,” he said. “We can’t go into next year with a $30 or $37 billion shortfall, because the reserves amount doesn’t get anywhere near that.” 
Continued fight over homelessness funding
Newsom has tussled with counties over homelessness funding for years as political pressure to resolve the state’s homeless crisis continues to mount. Newsom has blamed counties for failing to deliver results despite his $24 billion investment over the years. Only a portion of the funding goes to county agencies and there is no dedicated annual funding to fight homelessness.
On Thursday, Newsom again bashed counties for the problem while attributing a drop in unsheltered homeless people last year to his statewide programs. In the same breath, he also proposed to redirect “$1 billion in annual mental health funding to housing and treatment for people living on the streets” under Proposition 1, a voter-approved bond primarily for mental health beds and supportive housing.
“No more excuses — it’s time to bring people off the streets, out of encampments, into housing, into treatment. Counties need to do their job!” Newsom said, drawing applause from legislators.
It wasn’t immediately clear how he plans to allocate those dollars. He did not mention any funding for the Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program, the state’s main homelessness funding source. 
The California State Association of Counties, which represents all 58 counties and has lobbied for an annual allocation of $1 billion in HHAP funding, was displeased.
“Playing a shell game with existing funds is no substitute for the most successful program addressing homelessness at the local level,” said association CEO Graham Knaus. “Why on Earth would the state abdicate its responsibility and allow homelessness to soar again?”
Newsom’s plan also startled county behavioral health service providers, who rely on Prop. 1 dollars for services. 
“While these one-time bricks and mortar investments are promising, the $1 billion in funding for ongoing housing subsidies under Proposition 1 comes at the expense of redirected mental health treatment and prevention programs,” said Michelle Doty Cabrera, executive director of the County Behavioral Health Directors Association.
No mention of Medi-Cal
Newsom also gave next to no detail on the outlook for Medi-Cal — the state’s most expensive program with a $200 billion budget and therefore an attractive target for potential cuts. He didn’t even name the program in his speech.
The governor slammed Trump for passing a federal budget that could kick 1.8 million Californians off their insurance and raise the premiums for another 2 million. The state would have to spend at least $1.3 billion more than previously expected next year just to implement the federal law, the LAO previously estimated.

Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, said the state must “use the bully pulpit” to fight the federal government, find ways to lower costs or even revive indigent care, a form of last-resort care that has largely become obsolete due to Medi-Cal. 
“Because the alternative is, people are going to be dying on the streets,” Bonta said.
Bonta said the Legislature should explore new funding sources, such as a pair of proposed wealth tax ballot measures to fund health care and education that Newsom opposes.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
Much of the third day of the trial of former WWE wrestler Ted “Teddy” DiBiase Jr. consisted of testimony from the former welfare agency employee who drafted the first memos about the alleged scheme to misuse welfare money that was supposed to help needy Mississippians.
Mississippi Department of Human Services Inspector General David Barton’s colleagues in budgets and accounting had found a peculiar address on an invoice and brought it to Barton in 2019.  The retired Mississippi National Guard colonel took a closer look and quickly made some alarming discoveries. 
DiBiase had appeared to be an employee of the Mississippi Department of Human Services. He had an office on the executive floor and accompanied the agency director at the time, John Davis, to most meetings. Barton assumed DiBiase was being paid for his time, but he couldn’t find any payment from the agency to the wrestler.
Ted DiBiase Jr. speaks at the governor’s Healthy Teens Rally in 2018.
Starting with Barton’s tip, investigators eventually unraveled how the Mississippi Department of Human Services had pushed tens of millions of federal welfare dollars to two nonprofits through subgrants, which were then used by various people as a vehicle to skirt federal regulations. 
DiBiase received $3.1 million from the nonprofits, auditors found, with funding coming from the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and The Emergency Food Assistance Program. The federal government alleges this was embezzlement, while DiBiase asserts he was a lawful contractor.
Testimony Thursday from U.S. Department of Agriculture branch chief Polly Fairfield revealed that in 2018, the year DiBiase received nearly $500,000 from the emergency food program, the entire state of Mississippi received $1.2 million to administer the program. 
Fairfield explained that through the program, the federal government supplies food – fruits, vegetables, beans, meat, dairy, grains – to states, plus administrative money to pay for the storage and distribution of those goods to needy residents. 
DiBiase’s contract represents nearly half of the state’s entire administrative resources for the program that year. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Meynardie said the primary evidence of DiBiase’s work under that contract was a list of food pantries DiBiase compiled – “essentially a Google search.” 
This was all possible, Barton’s testimony demonstrated, because of a widespread breakdown of controls at the agency. Davis was appointed in 2016 by former Gov. Phil Bryant and was allowed to unilaterally choose who would receive subgrants and move money around with the ease of a text message.

It’s not unusual for state welfare departments to send federal grant funds to nonprofits to provide services to satisfy the goals of a program. But Mississippi barely monitored these nonprofits, even failing to maintain a list of entities it had awarded funds, the auditor’s office claimed.
If a nonprofit subgrantee wanted to outsource some of the services it promised to provide, it wasn’t required to tell the welfare agency who it contracted with and for what. Barton said he and his colleagues revised the agency’s subgrant manual to change this during Davis’ departure in 2019.
Barton joined the Mississippi Department of Human Services in 2017 shortly after the launch of the internal audit division, a new department prompted by legislation. He said one of his first tasks was to gather and build a repository for past agency audits. 
The problems predated Davis becoming director: Barton said in 2015, the agency’s audit found a significant deficiency in how it monitored subgrants. In 2016, the finding worsened to noncompliance. This repeated in 2017 and 2018.
“Did you find it frustrating,” DiBiase’s defense lawyer Sidney Lampton asked Barton, “when there would be a corrective action plan from DHS about how they were going to fix or improve, and then the very next year, the audit would say, ‘Y’all did the very same thing you did last year.’”
Change would eventually come, but only after Barton’s memo.
In October of 2018, under Davis’ leadership, the agency created an Office of Inspector General, which Barton led. Prior to this, a tip like a mysterious address on an invoice would have gone to a different division that Barton said did not have the ability to do the kind of investigation he did.
Barton’s first June 2019 memo was not primarily about DiBiase, but his brother Brett DiBiase, who also worked for Davis. The brother, another former wrestler, had contracted with the welfare agency to provide addiction education courses to state employees, but on his invoices to the agency, he suspiciously listed his company’s address as Davis’ post office box. Investigators later found Brett DiBiase was in rehab in California during the time he was supposed to be performing the contract.
After this discovery, Davis was quickly pushed out of MDHS. Bryant called the departure a retirement and praised Davis as someone who “dedicated his life to serving others.”
Once this information reached the auditor’s office, Barton said an agent there asked him to continue compiling what he could about what Davis was doing with the wrestlers.

The second memo discussed Teddy DiBiase’s leadership training program called “Law of 16,” which the government described in its opening statement as a self-help curriculum “copied from a number of sources.” Barton described the presentations, sometimes elaborate events with linen tablecloths, table arrangements and a performance by a gospel choir, in his memo as an “interactive praise/preaching type environment.” 
Davis rewarded DHS employees who attended the wrestler’s talks with days off – which is not allowed under state rules, Barton said. One of these trainings consisted of attendees watching the action film “Marine 2” produced by WWE’s film division and starring DiBiase.
MDHS also purchased polo shirts and Patagonia jackets branded with the “Law of 16” logo.
Days before Barton’s tip led to Davis’ ouster, DiBiase accompanied the welfare director to testify about Mississippi’s safety-net model before Congress. Davis described “Law of 16” during his testimony as “our personal and professional development programs” he hoped to bring to welfare recipients “to make sure that they are empowered to be whom they have been called to be.”

Liban Mohamed’s campaign announcement video posted to X on Monday has since gained more than 2.2 million views. But many of the online responses to the video on the social media platform drew condemnation from the leadership of the Utah Democratic Party. 
“We take no position on Democratic nominees for CD1,” the Utah Democratic Party said in a post about Mohamed’s campaign video. However, it added: “The flood of racist and religious hate directed at Liban Mohamed is disgusting. Let’s be clear where it’s coming from: the racism and white fragility on display from Republicans across this state is dangerous and embarrassing.”

Many of the online responses to the video called for Mohamed to be deported. But Mohamed is a U.S citizen. He was born in Logan and raised in Ogden. His parents are Somali immigrants, who he said came to Utah in the ’80s to attend Utah State University during a time when the civil war in Somalia broke out. While they continued their education, they decided to stay and raise their family in Utah. 
“Utah was a place that treated them so well. A place that educated them. A place that accepted them. So they settled down here, they had their kids. So I was born here,” Mohamed told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Thursday. 
Mohamed, 27, is Black and Muslim, and he currently lives in Salt Lake City. He decided to launch a bid for Congress after he said some leaders from the Black and Muslim communities encouraged him to run. He said he felt a “moral obligation to step up and try my best to fulfill that calling.” 
In the days since his campaign announcement, Mohamed said he’s been focused on the positive response both on and offline — from the “people from communities that are entirely different from myself flocking in my defense.” 
He said his phone has “blown up” with messages from people asking how they can volunteer and support his campaign, “that they feel like I can be that person that re-instills their hope.” 
“When I saw all of this, I teared up, honestly,” he said. “Because my dream of what I could be has already begun to unfold (from) a single post. So I hope that I can live up to those expectations and be that person the community is yearning for.” 
Mohamed said he’s intent on focusing on real-world issues — like bringing down costs for housing, child care and health care — rather than the online vitriol.
“Hate is an opportunity to educate and unite, and we will find beauty behind the madness,” he said. “I think this virality is an example of our ability to galvanize the community.” 
Mohamed said he hopes the focus isn’t on the “horrible rhetoric I was facing, but the beautiful defense that thousands came behind me with.” 










Hate is an opportunity to educate and unite, and we will find beauty behind the madness.


– Liban Mohamed


Mohamed joins at least five other Democrats who have announced bids for Utah’s new 1st Congressional District, which under a court-ordered map is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake City, and is projected to lean heavily Democratic. 
Other declared Democratic candidates include Salt Lake City Council member Eva Lopez Chavez, state Sen. Kathleen Riebe, state Sen. Nate Blouin, former state Sen. Derek Kitchen, and Utah’s last Democratic congressman, former Rep. Ben McAdams. 
Most recently, Mohamed worked on TikTok’s public policy team, managing the company’s response to political investigations — a role he said he has resigned from in order to run for Congress. He also previously worked for Meta, where he focused on data center sustainability policies, and as a government relations director at the American Heart Association in Utah. 
He said he hopes to take his expertise in tech — and his perspective as a young American — to Congress to represent younger generations and act as “somebody who can work across the aisle while simultaneously holding true to their progressive values and their principles.” 
While many of the responses to his campaign announcement were “vile and instilled fear into our communities,” Mohamed said he also understands that people who use bigoted or racist rhetoric around immigration issues are often scared or frustrated with the same economic problems he wants to help tackle.

Anger and blame placed on immigrants, Mohamed said, “are coming from a place of struggle. There is a reality behind those frustrations, and that reality is what I want to fight for, which is making our community a community that has economic stability.” 
“We’re going to make this campaign a campaign about positivity, a campaign about policy, and fighting for the frustrations that are at the root of all of these different concerns, which are people’s pocketbooks,” he said. 
“But the pocketbooks are not being hurt because of immigrants or minorities,” Mohamed added. “Their pocketbooks are being hurt because they’re being exploited by the wealthy. They’re being paid low wages, because affording a roof over your head is becoming increasingly difficult. Because they’re one hospital trip away from bankruptcy. Because raising a family is harder than ever.” 
So, Mohamed said he’s going to “focus on the real fundamental issues that I believe are the underlying motive behind these frustrations, and not focus on the bigotry and all of the rhetoric that is nothing but a distraction.” 
Mohamed’s campaign announcement also came at a time when President Donald Trump has taken aim at Somali immigrants. Immigration enforcement agents increased their presence in Minnesota in recent weeks as part of a targeted campaign ordered by Trump to deport undocumented Somali immigrants.  
Report: ICE headed to Twin Cities targeting Somali immigrants

Additionally, earlier this month the Trump administration said states would need to provide “justification” proving that federal child care funds are being spent on “legitimate” entities. The comments followed fraud allegations in Minnesota related to the state’s child care programs, which were already being investigated by state and federal agencies but blew up following a YouTube video by a right-wing social media influencer. The allegations particularly targeted child care centers run by Somali citizens of the state.
Mohamed called the intersection of his campaign announcement and Trump’s rhetoric surrounding Somali immigrants a “matter of coincidence.” He said he decided to enter the race before Trump’s comments against Somali immigrants began ramping up.
While Mohamed said one part of the root of frustrations against immigrants can be traced to resource scarcity — leading people to think they have to “push out” immigrants — he said another part of the problem is the “permissive structure that Donald Trump and the MAGA movement has provided for people to feel so emboldened to openly be so vile.” 
“So I hope that the 2026 and 2028 (election) cycles put the cap on that permission structure so that people know that they have to be careful with their words and respect and love your neighbors,” he said.

Albritton has held legal services contracts for a second straight month over a lawsuit regarding the simplified sellers use tax. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama legislator Thursday extended a delay of state agencies’ legal services contracts in protest of a lawsuit filed by several cities seeking changes to distributions of the state’s Internet sales tax.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, held six legal contracts totaling more than $1 million at Thursday’s Contract Review Committee meeting as the lawsuit against the levy, known as the Simplified Sellers Use Tax (SSUT), works its way through the court.
“We are now stuck and waiting to figure out what lawyers are going to come in and make a comment or try to deal with how the Legislature should handle public funds, who it should be going to and how it should be distributed,” Albritton said at the meeting. “That is the Legislature’s job. That is our constitutional responsibility. It has no role in the judicial matter at all.”
The move by Albritton, who also blocked the contracts at December’s Contract Review Committee, drew strong criticism from Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, who defended the actions of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The city of Tuscaloosa, parts of which are in England’s district, is part of the lawsuit.
“The distribution of funds from the SSUT creates a unique issue for municipalities and counties across the state,” England said. “As more people buy things online, it reduces the amount that you take in from brick-and-mortar sales, which, by the way, they get more from brick-and-mortar sales than from online sales.”
The dispute came a few hours after the Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA), which opposes the lawsuit, said that county law enforcement agencies could lose millions of dollars in funding should the cities prevail.
“County governments will spend almost $1 billion in providing funding to protect the citizens through the provision of law enforcement services in our state, almost a billion dollars,” said Sonny Brasfield, executive director of the ACCA, at a press conference in Montgomery Thursday. “During this current budget year, counties will receive about $200 million from SSUT, that money is essential in our ability to continue to provide the revenue that is necessary to protect our citizens.”
Before the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair in 2018, local taxing authorities such as cities and counties could only collect revenues from sales taxes on businesses located within their respective boundaries. The Wayfair decision allowed taxing jurisdictions to collect taxes on sales through the Internet.
Cities filed a lawsuit in August to challenge the simplified sellers use tax, alleging that it violates Alabama’s constitution and that some of the retailers that the Alabama Department of Revenue approved of should be disqualified and instead pay the traditional local sales tax of 10%, not the reduced 8% they currently pay.
The plaintiffs in the lawsuit want the Alabama Department of Revenue to remove several companies from the program that they believe are ineligible for SSUT because they have a significant presence in the state.
Lawmakers modified the program to place more stringent eligibility requirements for retailers to qualify for the reduced tax rate in SSUT, but the city of Tuscaloosa stated in its lawsuit that it is forfeiting $14.6 million in tax revenues because of the differences in the tax rate that businesses are eligible for because of SSUT.
England said during the meeting that local schools lose money because sales taxes from the growing volume of online purchases are distributed differently than the sales taxes obtained through brick-and-mortar transactions. England also accused the Alabama Department of Revenue, the agency responsible for overseeing SSUT, of allowing some retailers to collect taxes from transactions through SSUT that are local and should be part of the traditional sales taxes which can be allocated directly to local schools.
“Apparently, the Department of Revenue decided that any online transaction, even the ones that were not intended to be, like for example, if you order something from Walmart that is delivered to your house and you bought it from there, that is not a simplified sellers use transaction,” England said.
A spokesperson for the Alabama Department of Revenue declined comment on Thursday, saying the department does not comment on pending litigation.
Albritton said that smaller, rural areas are subsidizing more urban centers because customers will purchase items in stores located in places such as Mobile because they live in Chatom, for example, that has few retailers. SSUT, he argued, helps balance out the revenue.
Law enforcement
Each county allocates a different amount of its share of SSUT money to law enforcement and it is not clear how much of it goes to law enforcement. But all counties set aside a significant amount to public safety, according to Brasfield.
“In about 55 of the 67 counties, law enforcement is at least half of the counties’ budget,” Brasfield said. “That means the money is going to law enforcement everywhere. In rural Alabama, a much higher percentage of the money is going to law enforcement than in other counties.”
Doug Singleton, chair of the Montgomery County Commission, and Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham also attended the news conference to punctuate the point.
“It is about 12 to 15 deputies,” Singleton said about the impact of the lawsuit on law enforcement for Montgomery County.
The Association of the County Commissions of Alabama had been warning counties of the potential implications of the lawsuit throughout the year. The case is currently in mediation.
A message was sent to the city of Montgomery and the Alabama Education Association, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, on Thursday.
City of Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox said in a statement on Thursday that, “The people of Alabama are entitled to a system that is legal and fair, and one that ensures local sales taxes generated in a community remain in that community to support schools, public safety, and overall quality of life.”
He also said that, “Today, millions of Alabamians are experiencing fewer teachers, fewer police officers, fewer firefighters, fewer road projects, and less economic development as a direct result of SSUT’s legal flaws.”
Steve Boone, city manager for the city of Mountain Brook, said that the current way that the Simplified Sellers Use Tax is structured to reduce the tax collections that urban centers such as his city could collect.
“If larger, urban areas are not collecting what they would otherwise get, then that means somebody else is receiving more than what they would normally get,” Boone said in an interview on Thursday.
Boone said Mountain Brook also uses revenue received by the city from the Simplified Sellers Use Tax to fund law enforcement. The money is part of the general fund for Mountain Brook, which is then allocated to various departments, including law enforcement.
Boone also said that the city recently increased its sales tax by 1% because of shortfalls in the budget.
“If we were collecting what we should be collecting from the SSUT … it could have avoided, perhaps, some percentage of our sales tax increase that we needed,” Boone said. “Our costs go up every year. And that is a constant struggle for all cities.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Greg-Albritton-May-6-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 08:12:29.712853

(Clark County video screengrab)The prospect of purchasing a brand new 2,000-square-foot single-family home in the northwest part of the Las Vegas Valley for around $300,000 would be scoffed at by local realtors. But the opportunity to do just that is coming later this year, thanks to a new program spearheaded by Clark County.
Last month, the county broke ground on a 30-home development dubbed Rebecca Place, located on Rebecca Road and Tropical Parkway, just outside of Centennial Hills in the northwest part of the Las Vegas metro area .
The 30 homes will be sold to local, first-time homebuyers earning between 80% and 100% of area median income. That currently equates to between $68,000 and $85,000 per year for a family of three.
So, what’s the catch?
Rebecca Place is part of a county-managed community land trust (CLT) designed to keep homes attainably priced in perpetuity.
It works like this: The homebuyer acquires a mortgage for the physical home but enters into a long-term renewable ground lease with the CLT. Removing the land from the equation keeps the sale price lower for the buyer, but it comes with a commitment that, when they eventually sell, the home will again be sold at a below-market rate, using the same formula used for the initial sale.
CLTs and other shared-equity models of homeownership aren’t new, but they are more often managed by a nonprofit rather than a public entity.
Clark County Commissioner Marilyn Kirkpatrick believes it’s the first community land trust managed by a local government in the Western United States, if not the country.
“We looked across the country,” she said. “There’s a lot of private land trusts, but there really wasn’t any local governments.”
Kirkpatrick, a former state legislator, said the Nevada State Legislature has previously pondered investing in land trusts but nothing has come of it, so the county decided it could be a leader on the issue.
According to the Las Vegas Realtors, the median sale price for existing single-family homes in Southern Nevada in November was $488,995. The median price for condos and townhomes was $303,750.

The Rebecca Place homes — there are a few model types available — will be priced using a formula that takes into account the buyers’ incomes and expected to be in the low $300,000s.
“That is what many of the homes in that neighborhood sold for six, seven years ago,” said Kirkpatrick.
The homes are designed to fit into the surrounding neighborhood, so they have similar sized lots (most over 8,000 square feet), between 1,900 to 2,100 square feet of living space, and three-car garages.
All of those choices were intentional, says Kirkpatrick. The average home in the area has four or five cars. They are meant for families to grow and age in.
“We really took a lot of kid-gloves looking at it,” she added. “What made sense for the neighborhood? What makes sense for a future homebuyer? And really, for me, I’d personally just like it to be someone’s forever home. I hope they move in and never want to move out.”
According to Kirkpatrick, 800 people have already joined a waiting list to be notified about the Rebecca Place homes.
“Honestly, we haven’t really even advertised it yet,” she added. “So, that was all done through word of mouth…”
Prospective buyers, who will be subject to credit requirements, will eventually be entered into a lottery later this year.
In the meantime, the county is holding orientations to answer questions and emphasize how CLTs work.
Kirkpatrick stressed that people need to understand that shared-equity housing is vastly different from the unfettered, private real estate market. It is not designed for flippers, landlords or others who want to cash in the valley’s history of rising home prices.
“It’s intended to be attainable housing for the long term,” she said. “It’s intended to give (homeowners) a modest equity amount they can take and use for their next home for downpayment assistance. But it’s not, and should never be, intended to be a windfall for anybody.”
Kirkpatrick said the goal is for families to be moving into Rebecca Place by the last quarter of 2026.
She hopes between now and then the county can also break ground on other CLT developments, including one 200-unit development in the southwest that’s already been approved and is “moving through the process.” That project, called Cactus Trails, involved the county purchasing land for $1 an acre from the federal Bureau of Land Management.
“It’s not out of sight that we can do 500, 600 a year,” she said of the potential to scale up. Reaching that would likely require some financial investment.
Beyond the land, which the county already owned, the Rebecca Place homes may be subsidized by the county. If the cost to develop a CLT home is $370,000 but the attainable price is $320,000, the buyer’s mortgage would cover the latter amount and the county would cover the difference through a second silent mortgage.
The county will also offer downpayment assistance to help residents with upfront costs.
Kirkpatrick argues it’s a small investment considering what the county pays in rental assistance and other housing initiatives.
“I hope that we can move to where there’s no subsidies, except maybe for the permits and land, but today I’m prepared, I think it’s a good use of our dollars,” she added.
“There are always a few people that say the government shouldn’t be in the business. Well, I’m in the business one way or another. Might as well try to give people an opportunity to own a home.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/marylincropped-1024x598.jpg,,,2026-01-09 08:12:29.712853

Board members were originally supposed to vote on recommendations for social studies and arts education textbooks made by two separate committees —  one for social studies and one for arts — during the board’s  meeting last November.
The two committees, were appointed in April to review and rate textbooks. Those ratings were then sealed and given to the board in October.
The vote was delayed because of concerns raised by board members about the social studies textbooks recommended. Some board members raised questions about the short timeframe to review the textbooks, while some also expressed concerns the books might not reflect what they consider the values of Alabamians.
Mackey told board members during this month’s work session that he has created a new proposal that should be presented next month.
“I’m going to get with [Marie] Manning and [Kelley] Mooney next week and go through my proposal. If they say ‘you are absolutely crazy, go rewrite this’ then it might be March,” he said.
Mackey did not mention what his new proposal included, but did say there are “enough options” to present to the board in February with hopes to further the process.

Sept. 17, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceA Michigan court has ruled that the state’s plan to overhaul its mental health service delivery system violates state law, citing conflicts with the Michigan Mental Health Code. 
The decision, issued Thursday by Judge Christopher P. Yates of the Michigan Court of Claims, declared that the state’s 2025 request for proposal for a competitive procurement system restricts Community Mental Health Service Programs, which serve as the state’s prepaid inpatient mental health plan providers, from fulfilling their statutory obligations.
While the court denied the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, it stopped short of issuing an injunction to halt the transition process, instead ordering the state to address the legal conflicts identified in the ruling and bring the proposal into compliance with Michigan law. The court emphasized that sufficient Medicaid funds must be allocated to providers to allow them to perform their statutory duties.
The case stems from lawsuits filed by multiple inpatient providers and counties against the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Technology, Management, and Budget. The plaintiffs argued that the proposal, which aims to transition to a competitive procurement system by reducing from 10 to three the number of regions that prepaid inpatient health plans operate in, would impair their ability to provide mandated mental health services.
The proposal involves up to $6 billion in state-administered funding and is set to take effect in October 2026. 
In his ruling, Yates stated that the proposal would stop inpatient mental health plan providers from making contracts with service providers, even though those contracts are necessary to pay for services and to manage mental health care properly.
As those providers are required by law to offer many essential services, including crisis care, screening before hospital admission, protecting patients’ rights, and mental health advocacy, Yates ruled that the proposal conflicts with Michigan law, which requires community mental health agencies to coordinate care and protect patients’ rights by working through contracts with service providers.
Thursday’s ruling is not final and does not resolve all pending claims in the case, with Yates indicating that the court would consider injunctive relief if the state fails to address the legal issues raised in the ruling.

Every four years, people will come up with these bad ideas and try to advance them. It is hard to get positive movement on bills that make common sense for reforms.”

The ACLU of Alabama hosted a media briefing on Tuesday to discuss its legislative priorities for the coming session. Among them is HB 54, sponsored by Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, which would allow women who are pregnant while incarcerated to remain on probation for several weeks after giving birth.
“There’s so much data about the immediate connection and what that does to the newborn in its first moments,” said A’Niya Robinson, policy and organizing director for the ACLU of Alabama, at the briefing. “Practically speaking, the mother needs time to rest and recuperate, so why send her back to a facility that has a known history of harming people, of people dying?”
The legislation states women must inform staff working in the jail that they are pregnant during the medical screening process and that they are tested for pregnancy as part of the screening process unless they decline to be tested.
HB 54 would require bail to be granted to pregnant women so long as the court determines they are not a threat to themselves or to the public.
“The court shall allow a pregnant woman to be supervised on a pre-incarceration term of probation for the length of her pregnancy and for 12 weeks after the birth of her child,” the bill states.
Hollis introduced the bill in the 2024 and 2025 sessions, but it did not come to a vote. Several lawmakers, particularly Republicans, expressed concerns that the bill would allow women who became pregnant to avoid incarceration.
“It is important to remember that, the 12 weeks postpartum, that is essentially going to be considered a probation period,” Robinson said. “The mother is still going to have to check in. Her motions are still going to be monitored. It is not people trying to avoid incarceration, it is really a delay in our opinion.”
Robinson also said that the legislation establishes additional penalties women fail to report to the facility where they are incarcerated on top of the original convictions or charges.
Nearly all the criminal justice reform groups also support legislation that limits the death penalty. Two were filed by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa. One is HB 76, a constitutional amendment to abolish capital punishment in the state. A second bill, HB 70, would allow those who were sentenced to death by a judge over a jury’s recommendation of life without parole to pursue resentencing. This would apply to more than two dozen people currently on Alabama’s death row.
“It may be a bit of a tough lift, but it is a common sense policy,” Wakely said. “We should not have a different set of people sitting on death row when a jury pretty clearly found they did not deserve to die.”
Groups also expressed support for reforms to parole. HB 86, also from England, would give weighted consideration to parole applicants who tried to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated.
“Ultimately, it would create a more systematic, transparent, danger to public safety approach,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, in an interview on Tuesday regarding the parole reforms proposed in the legislation.
The groups also wanted to limit the likelihood of people who were granted parole returning to prison.
Alabama Appleseed also plans to support legislation that would preventing people on parole who have shown rehabilitation from returning to prison because of technical violations stemming from their parole or minor infractions.

As a result, the only question that a jury will consider if the case goes to trial is how much the department will pay in damages, Mississippi County Circuit Judge Robert Horack wrote in the order imposing sanctions.
The attorney general’s office, which represented the department, “repeatedly offered excuses ranging from secretarial blame to Dropbox malfunctions and staffing issues,” Horack wrote in Tuesday’s order. “Not a single deadline imposed by the court was met.” 
Along with missed deadlines to produce records, Assistant Attorney General Kevin Smith, the office’s deputy chief counsel for litigation, also failed to appear for scheduled hearings. One hearing he missed was on Oct. 4, when Horack announced he would sanction the department. 
The “deliberate disregard for the authority of this court to enforce its orders” resulted in the sanctions, Horack wrote.
Willa Hynes is suing the department, three of the agency’s corporate contractors and 15 individuals over the death of her son, Jahi Hynes, on April 4, 2021, at the Southeast Correctional Center in Charleston. 
Her attorney, Linda Powers, was not available to comment on Horack’s order.
In a statement to The Independent, Attorney General Catherine Hanaway’s office did not try to deflect blame for Horack’s ruling.
“Sanctions as a result of missing required court hearings are unacceptable and avoidable,” the statement read.
As of Wednesday, Smith is no longer an employee of the office.
The lawsuit alleges corrections officials and contract medical personnel ignored Jahi Hynes’ mental health needs and disregarded department rules for the safety of people in administrative segregation.
Jahi Hynes was placed in administrative segregation on April 3, 2021, after allowing the food port door in his cell to strike the hand of a corrections officer, causing minor injuries, and blocking the port with his mattress. 
The next day, he hanged himself with a bedsheet. 
Jahi Hynes was 27 and serving a 13-year sentence for first degree robbery. 
Horack followed the decision by recusing himself from the case and asking the Missouri Supreme Court to assign a new judge.
The corrections department declined to comment on the sanctions because it does not make statements about litigation, spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email to The Independent.
Hanaway was appointed as attorney general in August after her predecessor, Andrew Bailey, was named co-deputy director of the FBI.  The office has been reorganized to keep better track of cases, the office said, including the creation of a Civil Trials section.
“This change better aligns Attorney General’s Office resources with the needs of state agencies, and will provide the office increased efficiency and coverage.,” the statement read. “Case reassignments are being finalized currently.”
The department has been sanctioned previously for withholding records related to Jahi Hynes’ death. In April 2024, the department was ordered to pay more than $60,000 for knowing violations of the state’s Sunshine Law as it sought to shield records of his death. 
That penalty, $5,000 for the Sunshine Law violation and just over $55,000 for attorney fees, was paid from the state general revenue fund in August 2024.
Hynes’ death is one of more than 750 from the start of 2021 through November, according to records compiled by the Missouri Justice Coalition. The department has been reluctant to release records on the deaths, which reached a record of 139 in 2024.
The highest profile case is the death of Othel Moore on Dec. 8, 2023, in the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Three former corrections officers face criminal charges for assault, with two also charged with second degree murder and the third charged with involuntary manslaughter. Charges against two corrections officers were dropped after they were filed in June 2024.
There are pending wrongful death lawsuits for several other deceased inmates in addition to Hynes.
The discovery violations in the Hynes wrongful death case were numerous and the reasons for delays unconvincing, Horack wrote.
“For nine months following the court’s first hearing on plaintiff’s Motion to Compel on Feb. 11, 2025,” Horack wrote, “considerable deference was afforded to defense counsel and the matter of sanctions remained under advisement for approximately eight months.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-88622652-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 07:13:36.197807

(Getty Images)Indiana lawmakers got an early Christmas surprise back in December — a newly projected tax revenue boost. But that money puts them in a bit of a bind.
Do they let the state surplus rise to $5 billion by the middle of 2027 while also cutting state agency budgets, laying off workers and slashing social service assistance for poor Hoosiers?
It appears so.
“Though the state’s revenue forecast has improved compared to April 2025, it’s not responsible to spend money that hasn’t yet materialized. Senate Republicans will hold the line on major spending proposals, as budget decisions should be made during budget sessions,” the caucus said in a Wednesday news release.
Let’s review how we got here.
The two-year budget process began in December 2024 with a forecast that estimated how much tax revenue was expected to come in over the next two fiscal years. Then, state fiscal leaders spent months crafting a budget that would run from July 1, 2025, to June 30, 2027.
But just before they finalized the budget in April 2025, an updated forecast showed that much of the new revenue that had been expected wouldn’t materialize.
That forecast process has been used for decades and has generally served the state well. Lawmakers technically always spend money that is expected to come in the future.
New forecast shows big growth in Indiana surplus

It can be confusing, but think of it as if you were told you’d receive a 3% raise next year, so you used that to budget for the year. But, before it took effect, your employer dropped the raise to 1%. You will still receive more pay, though not as much as you had planned for.
So, lawmakers in April 2025 reduced the appropriations in the budget bill by about $2 billion. The two-year spending plan was signed into law in May. That led to Gov. Mike Braun cutting agency budgets, laying off hundreds of state employees and limiting child care subsidies, among other austerity measures.
Fast forward to December 2025, and the annual forecast comes around again. Except this time, the projections move in the other direction — a surprise boon! That means the state will now take in far more money than it is scheduled to spend.
This would be your boss unexpectedly going back to the 3% raise. Would you adjust your spending for the year, or save the additional amount?
The state surplus is now expected to rise to nearly $5 billion by mid-2027 — about double what was anticipated last summer. That’s almost 22% of annual state spending, when legislators usually try to keep it between 10-15%.
Future action?
Democrats are pushing to reverse some key cuts.
House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, said the first thing state government should do is eliminate the waitlist for low-income child care vouchers.
“Child care is such a big issue out there, for parents, for employers, something that we could do, we need to really work on that. We could use some of the money for that,” he told reporters Thursday. “I’ve toured a facility in Fort Wayne back in October, and then in December, they put out a notice that it’s closing. And it’s not the only one closing throughout the state. So the providers need paid; the parents need safe, productive places … where they can take their children. And that’s something that we really should do, and that’s everyone’s asking for. It very disappointing that it’s not on their priority list.”
The waitlist has entered its second year. There were more than 32,000 children in line in November, according to the latest update to a state dashboard. That’s constricting enrollment at providers already struck by the state’s cuts to voucher reimbursement rates.
Is the state really going to stockpile $5 billion when day cares are closing? And state employees are not getting a pay raise.
State Budget Director Chad Ranney told the Indiana Capital Chronicle the contingency fund that covers salary adjustments was reduced by 90%. While he hopes to find a way to help employees it might not be possible.
“The revenue has to materialize before we can spend it,” he said. “That’s a ton of money for the state to sit on but that’s 18 months away.”
Ranney also mentioned that the budget cut capital repair and rehabilitation funds, which could be adjusted
House Speaker Todd Huston said lawmakers were surprised when the forecast was downgraded last April and were surprised again with the positive news in December.
“That probably suggests to me that we probably should wait and see how this all shakes out. We know going into 2027 there are all sorts of changes taking place economically at the federal level and those types of things, and we really should probably wait to see how all that turns out,” he said Thursday. He hoped that would lead to a strong budget session in 2027.
There is a mechanism in state law to return surplus money to state taxpayers. The automatic taxpayer refund splits excess revenues between pension relief and income tax relief for Hoosiers. But it only kicks in during odd-numbered years unless lawmakers choose to change the schedule.
It doesn’t seem very conservative to take more taxpayer money than necessary, so Republicans have a choice: return it now or invest it in key areas that were previously slashed. Either can happen and still maintain an appropriate surplus to protect Indiana’s vaunted AAA credit rating and mantle of fiscal discipline.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Indiana is one of just a dozen states opting out of a summertime food aid program for hungry schoolchildren.
While anti-hunger advocates hope for a reversal, Indiana Family and Social Services Administration officials say the agency wasn’t appropriated the money required — and is busy planning for federal changes that could add a whopping $260 million a year to the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program expenses.
“If we could figure out how to do SUN Bucks in a more integrated way … but we just don’t have the bandwidth, nor the funding,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob told the Capital Chronicle.
SUN Bucks provides $120 in grocery benefits across a summer per eligible school-age child. The federal government covers the benefit, and splits administrative costs 50-50 with states.

The program began as a pilot, but debuted nationwide in 2024. About 669,000 Hoosier school-age children participated that summer, with a collective $80 million loaded onto their debit-like electronic benefit transfer cards.
School breakfasts and lunches can be many students’ only reliable meals, and they lose access when the academic year ends.
“SNAP benefits don’t change in the summer. So, you know, when kids are home, it’s not as though there’s any additional benefit that families have to help pay the grocery bill,” said Emily Bryant, the executive director of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry.
“This program was very successful in mediating the serious dangers of increase in child food insecurity during the pandemic,” Bryant said, referring to the temporary Pandemic EBT in place before SUN Bucks was established as a permanent option.
Gov. Mike Braun’s nascent administration didn’t take part in SUN Bucks last summer, and says the state will opt out this summer, too.
“The state of Indiana did it one time, and that was coming out of COVID,” Roob said. “And then, honestly, the previous administration didn’t plan to do it in 2025, so by the time we got here, that decision had been made for us — and there was not a legislative appropriation to do it for the upcoming year.
“Once you extend a a benefit, even on a temporary basis … taking it back is very painful,” he acknowledged.
Thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia currently plan to participate, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program at the federal level.
Indiana is one of 12 that won’t, along with Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming.
Costs and benefits
The state and advocates differ on the initiative’s worth.
“The SUN Bucks program is extremely expensive to operate, and provides relatively little additional supplemental nutritional assistance,” Roob said.
SUN Bucks oversight was expected to cost the state about $3.7 million last summer. But expenses will seemingly more than triple, according to FSSA spokesman Marcus Barlow.
“We estimate the cost per year for Administration of the program to be between $12 million and $15 million,” Barlow wrote.
Bryant, of Feeding Indiana’s Hungry, acknowledged that while SNAP has higher administrative costs, it pulls down significantly more in benefits from the federal government — upwards of $100 million monthly across the program’s 570 million participants, according to FSSA’s latest quarterly financial report.
But SUN Bucks targets the state’s most vulnerable: kids, she said.
“The return on investment may not be as large as what they like to see for larger programs, but when there are over 600,000 kids who would be eligible for this program, that’s impactful for those families,” Bryant said.
Her organization was among the more than 90 private-sector, faith-based and nonprofit organizations that signed a letter urging Braun, FSSA and the state Department of Education to approve Indiana’s participation in SUN Bucks.
Price tag rising
Indiana’s cost concerns go beyond SUN Bucks, however.
States could be on the hook for millions of additional SNAP expenses annually under the latest federal reconciliation law, better known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
States currently pay 50% of the cost to administer SNAP, but beginning Oct. 1, 2026, they’ll be on the hook for 75%.
That’s expected to cost Indiana $37 million in the 2027 state fiscal year, which begins July 1 and ends June 30, and about $50 million annually after, according to FSSA’s latest quarterly financial report.
That could complicate the argument for SUN Bucks next summer, but advocates are still working to build support, said Mark Lynch, the director of advocacy for the Indy Hunger Network.
“We’ll start focusing on ’27 for SUN Bucks — knowing that it’s a long shot, because that’s going to be even closer to when they’re going to have to start these cost shares,” he said.
How will the megabill impact Indiana’s budget? Hundreds of millions in federal dollars will be lost

Starting Oct. 1, 2027, states will also pay a percentage of benefit costs depending on the rate of errors they make in distributing the funds — overpayments and underpayments. Indiana logged a 9.27% payment error rate in the 2024 federal fiscal year, per the report. That runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.
That percentage would’ve cost the state an estimated $143 million in a year. Fewer mistakes could lower the hit to $72 million or even $0, but a rate higher than 10% would cost $214 million.
Roob said FSSA is hiring 65 more employees to lower Indiana’s payment error rate.
“The cost equation here is a pretty simple one, right? It’s much cheaper to hire 65 people than it is to pay $70 million,” he said.
The changes don’t end there.
Braun has embarked on a variety of state-level alterations to SNAP, most prominently by directing FSSA to secure federal permission to block recipients from buying sugary drinks or candy with their benefits. Dubbed “Smart SNAP,” it went into effect Jan. 1.
Other executive orders would add Hoosiers exempt from SNAP work requirements to an existing but “underutilized” state employment and training program; tighten asset eligibility tests for SNAP and scrutinize the program’s efficacy.
They were announced at a “Make Indiana Healthy Again” event in April headlined by two celebrity members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz.
State lawmakers are also considering changes.
Senate Bill 1, a priority proposal for the chamber’s Republican caucus, would end Indiana’s expanded eligibility for SNAP, which allows those with slightly more assets to participate than under the federal baseline. That would push an estimated 3,000 households off the program, according to a fiscal analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Services Agency.
Other provisions would set legal status requirements for SNAP participants — but count all of the income and assets of ineligible immigrants toward their household’s eligibility determination and benefit allotment.
“I’m very concerned about the ideological focus of a lot of the legislation and administrative actions,” said Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany, speaking generally about recent moves. Clere is a prominent Statehouse advocate for SUN Bucks, SNAP, Medicaid and other programs.
“It may be well-intended, but it misses the mark if our big-picture goal is a more efficient and accountable system providing the best possible value for for all Hoosiers,” he said.
Looking elsewhere
Struggling Indiana residents can locate other summertime food help via DOE’s Summer Food Service Program.
Roob also highlighted the federal Women, Infants and Children nutrition program administered in Indiana by the Department of Health, along with food banks and pantries across the state.
“Our food banks have always and continue to serve folks in need … any time of the year, and that’s never going to change,” Bryant said.

But, she added, “We will continue to make the case that participating in federal nutrition programs … are more efficient and effective because they are at scale.”
Lynch, of the Indy Hunger Network, said food pantries noticed an increase in demand over the summer, “long before” a federal shutdown delayed SNAP benefit disbursement in the fall.
“We know what it looks like now,” he said of the demand.
Hoosiers can find free food — and stores that take SNAP and WIC — statewide using the network’s Community Compass website.
Food insecurity has risen in Indiana, according to a USDA report released late last year.
“There’s still so much hunger in Indiana, and there shouldn’t be — there doesn’t need to be,” said Clere. “… We have enough resources to reduce and ultimately eliminate hunger, but we often fail to make it a priority and to take advantage of resources that are available, and SUN Bucks is a great example.”
“We ought to be able to look past (administrative and other costs) for the benefit of the children who would … be better-fed and less hungry, and able to have a better summer and a better childhood,” he said. “That’s really what it comes down to.”

But alternatives to fossil jet fuel currently account for less than 1% of all jet fuel dispensed. (Photo courtesy of Alaska Air Group)A who’s who from Washington state business and Democratic politics on Thursday extolled the virtues of alternative jet fuel and said the state would strive to become the nation’s leading enabler of greener flying.
The occasion was a splashy launch event in Snohomish County for a new state-funded eco-fuel development nonprofit, dubbed the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator. 
The business accelerator debuted with $10 million in tax dollars approved by the Legislature, matched by another $10 million from an unidentified philanthropic donor. Those new commitments build on tens of millions of dollars the Legislature and Congress previously allocated. The earlier funding was meant to lure alternative fuel refiners to Washington state, supports a Washington State University research lab, and incentivizes green jet fuel use in the state.
Executives from Boeing, Amazon, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle joined Gov. Bob Ferguson, state legislators and the president of WSU on stage at Boeing’s Future of Flight visitor center next to Paine Field.
“Collectively, we have the political will and the private partnerships to get big things done,” state Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, told the standing-room crowd.
State Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said, “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it.”
The state’s approach contrasts with the Trump administration, which just this week pulled the U.S. out of the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trump administration officials have heaped scorn on taxpayer-financed decarbonization incentives. They favor policies to maximize fossil fuel production to drive down energy costs.
“While there are confusing signals coming out of the other Washington, the rest of the world is all-in on sustainable aviation fuel,” Liias said. “This is the fuel of the future.”
The board chair and vice-chair of the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator said the trade organization would lead education and advocacy efforts, recruit companies, invest in research and go to bat for project developers.
The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. There are multiple methods to make it using a variety of feedstocks such as crop and forestry waste, used cooking oil, algae or hydrogen. Depending on the details, the eco-fuel can reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by anywhere from 50% to 80%.
SAF is favored by airlines because it is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works with existing airplane engines and fuel infrastructure. Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel. Major engine makers are in the process of testing and certifying engines for 100% SAF.
The trouble is that SAF currently costs two to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. The high price and limited supply are holding back wider adoption.

At present, there is no continuous, commercial-scale production in Washington state. But several major companies have plants in design or construction.
Dutch energy company SkyNRG said Thursday that it aims to break ground in late 2027 or in 2028 on a large biofuel production facility at the Wallula Gap industrial park along the Columbia River southeast of Pasco. The company plans to produce 50 million gallons per year of SAF and renewable diesel by converting bio-methane collected from local and regional landfills, as well as a little bit from cow manure digesters.
A competitor named Twelve recently completed construction on a synthetic jet fuel plant in Moses Lake. Twelve plans to use a power-to-liquid production method that relies on lots of renewable electricity to transform carbon dioxide captured from the air and water into what it calls “E-Jet” fuel.
Executives at Twelve portrayed the Moses Lake facility as a demonstration plant. It may begin production in a matter of weeks and ramp up to 50,000 gallons annually. The California-based company plans to locate a much larger commercial-scale E-Jet fuel plant somewhere in the Midwest.
On the west side of the Cascades, BP received nearly $27 million in federal grant funding in 2024 to buy equipment and make upgrades at its Cherry Point refinery. The goal is to begin production in 2029 of 10 million gallons of SAF annually using biomass feedstocks, like food waste, vegetable oil and beef tallow. The BP oil refinery in Whatcom County is connected by pipeline to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and the major airports in Vancouver, British Columbia and Portland, Oregon.
If you add up the capacity of the eco-jet fuel projects announced in the state so far, you make only a modest dent to transition Washington airports to climate-friendly fuel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024. According to the Port of Seattle, Sea-Tac Airport alone dispenses around 600 million gallons of jet fuel per year, a number expected to rise over the coming decade.
By the end of the decade though, an Oregon border county could become home to a much larger alternative fuel refinery whose output would equal Sea-Tac’s annual demand. A Texas-headquartered company named NXTClean Fuels is in the process of permitting an alternative jet fuel and renewable diesel refinery along the Columbia River near Clatskanie with a capacity of 750 million gallons per year.
If that project comes to fruition, it would theoretically go a long way toward addressing limited supply in the Pacific Northwest. But that still leaves the barriers of feedstock availability and affordability for airlines.
During a press availability following Thursday’s launch event, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, John Plaza, said he foresaw plenty of availability of the renewable natural gas raw ingredient that his company needs to make jet fuel at its planned southeast Washington plant.
Airlines such as Amazon Air have demonstrated some willingness to pay a premium to achieve climate and sustainability goals.

“We strive to have the airline industry pay as little a premium as possible,” Plaza said.
The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior advisor Andy Billig in a separate interview. Billig is a former state Senate majority leader who played an instrumental role in the 2023 passage of state tax incentives for SAF producers and users during his final term in office. The state tax credit is worth up to $2 per gallon and can be stacked with federal incentives.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alaska_airlines_biofuel_001-1024x682.jpg,,,2026-01-09 07:13:36.197807

“I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing right now, taking families,” Dasea-Torres said.
Over a thousand people joined Dasea-Torres Thursday. They walked the streets under a steady, cold rain, blocking traffic, blocks away from where Good, 37, was fatally shot Wednesday morning by a federal immigration agent who has been identified as Jonathan Ross by the Star Tribune.
Many protestors likely have vivid memories of days of demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd, less than a mile from here.
Minneapolis residents have borne the brunt of the latest wave of immigration agents — said to be 2,000 — sent to Minnesota this week by the Department of Homeland Security.
No federal or local law enforcement appeared to be present at the Thursday evening protest. Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the Minnesota National Guard “out of an abundance of caution” to be prepared to help local law enforcement keep order.

Protests have been ongoing since the shooting. Protesters gathered at the scene immediately after the shooting; later that evening, thousands gathered to mourn Good in an evening vigil and a protest against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
Early Thursday morning, protesters clashed with federal agents at the Whipple Building, the federal building ICE has been using. The Star Tribune reported that agents threw some protesters to the ground and detained them; one protester was detained for throwing an apple core at a squad car.
And later that morning, more than 100 multifaith religious leaders huddled around the site of the shooting, which has been turned into a memorial for Good, to make three demands: that ICE leave Minnesota; that the federal government allow state investigators access to evidence for an independent state investigation; and that Congress also investigate the shooting.
A speech written by Jovita Morales from the Minnesota Immigrant Movement opened the Thursday evening protest, which was jointly organized and publicized on social media by local chapters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, 50501 and the Democratic Socialists of America.
“The incident in which an ICE agent took the life of our community member and a young woman demonstrates a complete lack of preparation and serious negligence. We demand justice through an investigation,” said Ivonne Hernandez, who delivered the speech on behalf of Morales.
On Wednesday, the feds kicked Minnesota criminal investigators off what was initially a joint investigation. The maneuver has drawn sharp criticism from local officials and protesters, who demanded an investigation independent from the federal government, whose top officials have already publicly drawn conclusions that contradict existing video evidence.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday that Good “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.” A video provided to the Reformer shows an officer positioning himself in front of the vehicle and firing three shots through the windshield as Good attempted to turn the car away from the officer.
Ben Andrews wasn’t aware of the protest in advance but saw it passing by his house. Andrews said he’s been receiving neighborhood notifications of ICE presence “semi-regularly.”
“This used to be a great neighborhood. This neighborhood was going up. All this ICE sh*t doesn’t make anybody better,” Andrews said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)We’re heartened to see even the smallest increase in human dignity behind bars, like the earned living unit at Stillwater Correctional Facility: Men sleeping safely in their own cells; “high” wages ($1.50 an hour); environmental beautification; couches and exercise equipment in common areas. These were common safety creating practices in the 1980s, and should be again. 
But why is Gov. Tim Walz spending millions on a temporary incentive in a facility that’s scheduled to close in 2029 while blocking the most important safety incentive on the books — earned release? 
In 2023, the Minnesota Rehabilitation and Reinvestment Act was signed by Walz, incentivizing safety through rehabilitation, with Department of Corrections Commissioner Paul Schnell leading the charge. Everyone in prison — not serving a life sentence — would now have an opportunity to earn up to 17% off their sentence, and 11% off supervision for completing programming and good behavior. Half the resulting savings to taxpayers were to be reinvested in victim services, the rest to rehabilitation, creating a feedback loop of safer prisons, communities and more supported victims. 
The DOC promised 18-24 months to implement. 
Now, 30 months later, the Walz administration appears to be undermining its own law. 
The Department of Corrections’ new implementation timeline means basically no releases until May of 2027 — yet every day families of the estimated 2,800 people potentially eligible for release may be losing time with their loved ones they can never get back. Failure to follow the law also stops the administration from their own policy goal of closing Stillwater early, wasting millions that could be used to create better conditions everywhere. 
This lack of leadership has consequences. Guards were stabbed and a man murdered in Rush City because the maximum security prison is unnecessarily overcrowded and double bunked, and people are losing the hope gained when the MRRA passed. 
Toxic prison environments are killing us, with both prison guards and long-term incarcerated people dying decades earlier than average. And this environment also contributes to recidivism — nearly 80% of DOC “graduates” are projected to be arrested within five years of release. 
Why is Walz signing laws he’s not willing to implement? 
Data suggests incentive-based leave programs like the MRRA can dramatically reduce recidivism: In Oregon, just 10% who earned significant incentive returned, compared to 30% who didn’t, per Crime Victims United, while return rates were 55% lower under the federal First Step Act.
The facts show that rehabilitation is not a luxury, it is a basic precondition for safety, both for people inside prisons and the broader community. 
Nor does stalling create safety. Everyone eligible for MRRA will be released regardless of rehabilitation. So while some may jeer whenever someone let out early is returned to prison, we know the individuals in question will be released one way or another. 
The question is not whether some will come back, but, rather, how do we get the most safety with our tax dollars? 
By incentivizing rehabilitation through earned early release, the MRRA increases safety for everyone who lives and works in prison, as well as for the community once people are released. Savings become investments in victims and further rehabilitation. A fully utilized MRRA would be a huge step towards making safety the rule – not the exception.
But it won’t if this administration fails to follow the law they signed.  
A recent Minnesota court case found unconstitutional the gradual rollout of a new child welfare law to just 30% of those eligible, because it failed to provide equal protection to the 100% it should support. The current MRRA rollout is denying nearly everyone eligible.  
As we write, three men in Faribault are suing on the same grounds. Though currently without legal representation, they recognize that every day that slips away is time stolen from children, parents, friends — time they will never get back, even if the MRRA is eventually implemented. 
This is playing politics with people’s lives. And a governor who signs legislation but doesn’t implement it is, in effect, a governor in name only.
Governor: As you sit down with your own family in the coming months, we beg you to consider if anything can substitute for the living presence of loved ones in the sacred moments of our lives. 
Nor should we erase the fact that Schnell, the DOC commissioner, successfully intervened to lighten the prison sentence of his ex-wife, following her conviction for premeditated attempted murder. When it came to his family he understood that time is all we have. Under the MRRA law, all Minnesotans should have access to earn a fraction of what the commissioner’s own family has already received. 
We – incarcerated Minnesotans, their loved ones, and all who want safer communities – call on Schnell, Walz and the Legislature to do right by the 27,000 people under the DOC’s control.
Implement the safety law you championed, passed and signed.
If reform is to mean anything, it must be measured not by legislation passed or photo ops at facilities slated to close, but by lives changed. Anything less is political theater.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN251120_166-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 07:13:36.197807

Helping people recover requires a strong system where treatment and community-based recovery supports work together.
Treatment provides medical care and counseling during a crisis. Recovery support services help people stay on track afterward by building routine, confidence, and healthy connections.
These supports include peer mentoring, transportation, job and family assistance and recovery community centers. For many people, recovery housing is also an important piece of this system. A safe and stable place to live can make the difference between moving forward in recovery or falling back into old patterns.
As the executive director of the Missouri Coalition of Recovery Support Providers, I work with programs that offer these community-based supports across the state. Our members include faith-based, peer-based and community-based organizations that help people rebuild their lives. We work closely with treatment providers, courts and health agencies because recovery is strongest when all parts of the system are connected. No single agency can meet every need, and no one recovers alone.
Within this broad network of services, recovery housing has a special role. When people leave treatment, jail, or unstable living situations, they need a safe place to go. The environment they enter can have a major impact on their long-term success. Good recovery homes offer structure, peer support, and accountability. They give people a stable foundation during one of the most vulnerable points in their recovery journey.
That is why MCRSP serves as Missouri’s official affiliate of the National Alliance for Recovery Residences, the national leader in defining safety and quality standards for recovery housing. In this role, MCRSP reviews and accredits recovery homes across Missouri. We make sure these homes meet clear standards for safety, resident rights, operations, peer support, and ethical practices.
Accreditation is a sign that a home is committed to safety and quality. Accredited homes undergo a formal review and must make improvements when needed. They are checked again on a regular basis. This gives families, treatment providers, courts, and state agencies confidence that the residence is safe and well-run.
Choosing an accredited home also protects residents from unsafe or poorly managed facilities. Standards around safety, privacy, training, financial responsibility, and peer support help prevent harm and create a positive environment for recovery.
For professionals in health care, behavioral health, criminal justice or social services, referring clients to accredited recovery residences should be the first choice. Accredited homes offer the strongest assurance that residents will be supported and protected. They also provide the structure and peer connections that research shows improve long-term recovery outcomes.
Accredited homes strengthen the communities around them as well. With clear rules, trained leaders, and strong local partnerships, these homes help reduce stigma and build trust. Safe, well-run housing benefits both the residents and the neighborhoods they are part of.
As Missouri continues to invest in behavioral health, we must ensure that recovery housing grows with the same level of safety and oversight as the rest of the system. Accreditation is not a barrier — it is a safeguard for residents, families, and communities.
Recovery is personal, but it should not be faced alone. When treatment providers, state agencies, and community partners work together and choose accredited recovery residences, Missourians have their best chance to rebuild their lives and regain hope.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1737318871-e1767914815756-1024x614.jpg,,,2026-01-09 06:57:01.588651

Lawmakers have already sought to restrict immigration arrests at courthouses. Other states have attempted additional restrictions with varying success.

Can Vermont lawmakers restrict how federal immigration authorities operate in the state?
Democrats are poised to try this session, mulling legislation that would limit where civil immigration arrests can occur and would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks in most cases. 
Vermonters should be able to visit sensitive locations “without fear of being snatched,” Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, a sponsor of two bills addressing immigration agents’ actions, told her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

The bills were introduced in the Senate this week. S.209 would prevent civil arrests at schools, government buildings, health care facilities and what the bill calls community-based shelters, severe weather shelters and emergency housing. Meanwhile, S.208, largely restricts when law enforcement officers can wear masks and requires officers to identify themselves verbally or by badge. 
Federal courts have met similar policies elsewhere in the country with mixed reactions, and President Donald Trump’s administration continues to challenge states’ attempts to regulate U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, such as in California, where lawmakers have sought to generally ban federal agents from wearing masks.  
Both pieces of legislation in Vermont cite the 10th Amendment, which gives states powers not specifically granted to the federal government. 
But legislative attorneys cautioned Vermont’s Senate Judiciary Committee that the potential legality of restricting ICE in Vermont would depend on a tangled web of federal laws, case law and active court cases. 
Rik Sehgal, a lawyer for the Legislature, told lawmakers Wednesday that federal courts have for the most part found that limited arrests by immigration authorities at courthouses is “approved by the 10th Amendment.”
Whether states can restrict immigration arrests in more locations is “a little bit gray,” he said.
And regarding the federal laws potentially restricting Vermont’s ability to limit federal agents from wearing masks, Sophie Zdatny, a lawyer for the Legislature, told lawmakers that “the Supreme Court has really not addressed this particular immunity for over a century.”
There’s no federal law, policy or rule that explicitly authorizes masking for law enforcement, Zsatny said, though U.S. Department of Homeland Security leaders have said officers have discretion to wear masks. 
Both bills have strong support from Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, who sits on the judiciary committee. In an interview Thursday, he pointed to the increasing presence of ICE in Minneapolis, where an immigration agent shot and killed a woman Wednesday, as a reason why the bills are necessary.  
“We have to be proactive about that, because I will bet you every cent I have that within the year, Burlington and Winooski will see raids,” Baruth said, adding that he was comfortable supporting bills the Trump administration might challenge in court. “We’re kind of fighting with our backs to the wall as states.”
In Vermont, federal immigration agents have conducted arrests wearing masks. Mohsen Mahdawi, a Vermonter and Palestinian activist, was detained by masked officers in Colchester following an interview regarding his citizenship. 
In 2022, Vermont lawmakers restricted immigration arrests in and around courthouses, a protection other states have attempted to enshrine as well. In other states, ICE has made a practice of arresting immigrants in and around courthouses. Last November, a federal judge upheld a New York law preventing immigration arrests at state courts.  
Rep. Martin LaLonde, D-South Burlington, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said he intended to take up the Senate’s ICE bills should they reach his committee later this year.

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)A Senate panel advanced legislation Thursday that would require electric companies to develop new tariffs to be levied on “large-load” data centers, with the goal of protecting New Jersey residents, businesses, and other regular ratepayers from increased costs driven by the power-hungry centers.
The bill would require public electric utilities to submit proposed tariffs to the state Board of Public Utilities and incentivize data centers to increase energy efficiency by adopting technologies that capture and use the heat they generate. Under the bill, energy users of more than 100 megawatts monthly would be charged the new tariffs beginning one year after the bill’s enactment.
The bill has 10 sponsors, all Democrats.
New tax subsidies for Prudential Center renovation inch closer to law

It passed along party lines in the Senate’s budget committee, despite debate among lawmakers and advocates about whether the measure would achieve its goal of insulating regular ratepayers from increased costs.
Alex Ambrose of progressive think tank New Jersey Policy Perspective urged legislators to pass the bill, reminding them that the Garden State’s utility rates are 20% higher than the national average and will continue to rise without action.
Artificial intelligence data centers already are straining the region’s power grid, and the situation could worsen, Ambrose said. PJM Interconnection — the region’s energy grid operator — could soon allow data centers to connect to the grid even if there’s not enough energy, she noted.
“That means that data centers may be prioritized over regular people,” Ambrose said. “It’s clear that PJM and the federal government aren’t going to help, so it’s time for the states to step up. We need guardrails to protect people from higher bills. This is one step in the right direction.”
But Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) called the plan “a shell game” in which ratepayers likely still will get stuck with higher bills. O’Scanlon, along with the committee’s three other Republican members, voted against the bill.
“This is really just a transfer of cost. These operators and data centers, their percentage of profit — if they want to make it, they’re going to make it. If we charge them more to take electricity costs and dump it on them, they’re just going to charge it back to keep their profit,” O’Scanlon said. “It’s going to come right back to the end users to be paid through our phones, our data plans, etcetera.”
Sen. John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester), a committee member and one of the bill’s prime sponsors, countered that data centers “are different, and they have to be treated differently.” PJM has reported that it expects energy demand in its 13-state service area to grow 32 gigawatts by 2030, with most — 30 gigawatts — coming from data centers.
Burzichelli and the panel’s eight other Democrats voted in favor of the bill.
The full Assembly passed the bill in June, and it’s expected to go before the full Senate for a vote Monday. It’s unclear whether Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, would sign it. He leaves office on Jan. 20.

Hemp, used for industrial purposes and now grown legally in Wisconsin, is made from a variety of the cannabis plant that is low in THC, the active ingredient that is responsible for the intoxicating effect of marijuana. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Wisconsin lawmakers are backing competing visions for the future of hemp in the state. One proposal, (SB 682), was discussed during a Thursday meeting of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Revenue. The bill would create a regulatory structure for hemp-derived cannabis products which would preserve the state’s hemp industry despite a federal ban set to take effect in November. Without state-level intervention, or the federal government choosing to reverse course, hemp growers and distributors fear that Wisconsin’s $700 million industry and about 3,500 jobs will disappear.
Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), chair of the  Agriculture and Revenue Committee presented the bipartisan hemp bill to his committee, which he authored with bipartisan support. Testin’s legislation would define hemp as cannabis plants with no more than 0.3% of delta-9 THC (or the maximum concentration allowable under federal law up to 1%, whichever is greater) and define “hemp-derived cannabinoids” as any such compound extracted from the hemp plant. THC concentrations would be determined using specific high-performance testing methods. 
Wisconsinites would need to be at least 21 years old to purchase hemp-derived cannabinoid products under the bill, which mandates that products undergo independent lab testing to ensure that they contain the amount and type of cannabinoids described on the product’s label. This practice, known as truth-in labeling, is something the hemp industry has called for in recent years. 
Products could not be sold under the bill without labeling including contact information for the manufacturer or brand owner, serving sizes per container of product, ingredient lists including allergens, potency labeled in milligrams, and any necessary warnings. Under the bill, hemp-derived products could not contain more than 10 milligrams of THC in a single serving. 
Testin said Thursday that globally, the industrial hemp market was valued at roughly $11 billion in 2025, and is expected to reach $48 billion by 2032. “Despite its wide availability, the regulation of [hemp-derived cannabinoid] products is essentially non-existent, leaving a patchwork of different approaches taken by states across the country,” he said. 
In Wisconsin, such products “are generally recognized as legal but unregulated,” Testin said. “There are no state laws that restrict the sale to minors, regulate the potency or content of [hemp-derived cannabinoid products], or establish labeling or packaging requirements.” Minnesota, Kentucky, Tennessee and other states have moved to enact their own regulations, Testin said. “Regulations are needed to eliminate the current uncertainty regarding the status of [hemp-derived cannabinoid products], provide stability and certainty for businesses looking to enter this segment of the economy, and enact public safety regulations.”
Both Testin and Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) have worked on hemp laws for Wisconsin since the federal Farm Bill passed in 2018. “I’ve actually grown hemp,” said Kurtz, recalling that in 2019 “it was kind of a wide open market.” People that Kurtz and others called “bad actors” throughout the hearing also rode the hemp wave, seeing it as a “get rich quick scheme.” Kurtz said that today, the hemp industry is filled with people who want to do the right thing, but that “bad actors” have persisted. 
Kurtz said SB 682 is designed to ensure that Wisconsinites “get the very best product, and they know what they’re getting.” He stressed that “if we do nothing, then hemp is going to be illegal at the federal level…but it will still be legal here in the state of Wisconsin. So I think it would behoove us to work together, get a good compromise, a good common sense piece of legislation to make sure that we — in my humble opinion — protect our constituents, but also protect an industry that I think is needed.” 
Although hemp would be illegal at the federal level, a state-level industry could still operate similarly to the way some states have fully legal recreational or legalized cannabis programs, largely because the federal government has not cracked down on those industries. 
Testin added that “regardless of anyone’s thoughts as it relates to cannabis and cannabinoids, it’s here. And obviously we have a lot of different approaches as to how to best move forward.” He repeatedly took aim at the “stupidity” of what he described as “our overlords” in Washington D.C., but also criticized other hemp-related bills being pushed in Wisconsin. Whereas some Republicans are seeking to ban hemp products outright, others have differing ideas about how a legal industry should be regulated. 
A bill introduced by Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto), SB 681, would require that manufacturers and distributors of hemp-derived cannabinoid products have permits. Products would be sold under a three-tier system, and would be regulated similarly to alcohol under the Division of Alcohol Beverages, a component of the Department of Revenue, which would be renamed to the Division of Intoxicating Products. 
Although both Testin and Wimberger’s bills have gained bipartisan support, Testin described Wimberger’s bill as “the dead bill” and “deader than dead.” Testin argued that SB 681 would over-regulate the hemp industry, and even lead to a monopolization effect where a small number of entities could control who gets hemp permits, shape an otherwise competitive market, and operate in a “good ol’ boys club” manner. 
Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi) highlighted  the divide among state Republicans over hemp and cannabis products, stressing that Democrats are not the ones holding up legalization and regulation.
The committee room was filled with people from across the hemp industry who listened to the conversation. When lawmakers questioned how to ensure that children do not acquire intoxicating hemp products, distributors and manufacturers pointed to age-verification software even for online sales, which require a photograph and image of a driver’s license to approve an order. There was also discussion about how to prevent products from being marketed to children using cartoon-like advertising and appealing candy wrappers. 
Some veterans testified, describing how hemp helped them alleviate pain, kick addictive pain killers, soothed PTSD symptoms, and calmed the body for sleep. Other testimony centered on the danger involved in crossing state lines to Michigan or Illinois to acquire cannabis to treat various medical conditions. Hemp farmers stressed that they need to know now how they will be affected by a looming federal ban as they decide when or whether to plant their crops in the spring. 
Much of the public testimony was supportive of  Testin’s bill, though some speakers said that it needed to be amended to protect farmers and growers, and also expand the kinds of products it would cover including drinks and gummies. 
“Yes, we are now in a scenario where there are intoxicating hemp products,” said Testin. “But just no different than anything like beer, wine, or alcohol, we need to have some sensible regulations put in place, which this bill aims to do just that.”
As for “concerns about getting baked or getting high from these products,” Testin added, “it’s no different than those individuals who go out and consume too many old fashioneds at fish fry on a Friday night, or have too many beers. It’s about personal choice and responsibility, but at the same time making sure that we have some regulations put in place.”
The hemp industry deserves to “thrive and grow,” Testin said, while the public deserves protection and to know “that this stuff isn’t falling into the hands of people it shouldn’t be in, like kids.”

Imagine if someone committed a crime when they were in their twenties that required them to serve two years in prison, but due to a system error, they were held until they were 50. For nearly 30 years, this person was in prison despite being eligible for release decades earlier. The second the story broke, there would be a national outcry at the injustice.
Sadly, this isn’t a hypothetical. This is the reality for countless people across New Jersey. Many individuals who committed crimes decades ago, served their time, and are eligible to have those records expunged are trapped in a virtual prison, unaware of how to access expungement. Despite being eligible for the freedom of a fresh start, they live smaller lives, avoiding situations where their past record may be an issue. Meanwhile, someone in the same situation will have received an expungement the moment they were eligible and resumed their regular life, simply because they had the resources and the knowledge to do it.
For the past year, in partnership with legislators, the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, Volunteers of America Delaware Valley, community barbershops, and churches from across the state, STONO Public Affairs has hosted nine “expungement clinics” in cities across the state. These clinics were designed to assist people who may be eligible for an expungement of a past crime but are unaware of how to access it. STONO worked purposely to bring these services out of government buildings directly to the community with the help of barbershop owners and faith leaders.
What we found is that thousands of people are being held hostage by the worst day of their lives. Even when people have recovered, matured, worked hard to change their lives, and demonstrated that for over 20 years they have not had one other incident involving law enforcement, they are still trapped by what happened on that one bad day.
But that one bad day ultimately impacts us all. The lingering impact of that one day leads people to avoid better employment opportunities, presuming they will be denied. As a result, entire communities that would otherwise be eligible for jobs where there are critical vacancies, like health care, do not bother applying and take lesser-paying jobs, impacting their ability to support themselves and the overall economy.
Housing is another area in which criminal records often present barriers. Landlords in more “desirable neighborhoods,” in areas closer to better schools, are more likely to do background checks, excluding individuals who have more than served their time, and furthering the state’s segregation problem. The lingering effects of that one bad day may make people ineligible for homeownership or educational or training opportunities that could lift their families out of poverty. More than anything, it denies them the simple dignity of being judged by who they are and not what they did 20 years ago.
The faces and crowds at our expungement clinics point to the historic over policing of Black and brown communities. When faced with the choice of arrest, grace is rarely an option for these individuals. Over the years, the courts have shown a commitment to alternatives to incarceration. However, the large turnout at these events indicates that a commitment to alternatives to arrest may be more necessary.
Additionally, we observed that many people are not eligible for expungement because their crime was classified as a “terroristic threat” at the time of arrest. Often, this threat was made during a heated argument or fight.  Given our recent history, it is understandable that a terroristic threat should always be taken seriously and remain on one’s record. However, the definition should be refined to ensure the description is accurate. A threat made in the heat of the moment is distinct from a threat intended to advance terrorism.
Legal expungement can be life-changing for those affected, but it is often overlooked by those who are not impacted. New Jersey Public Defender Jen Sellitti deserves praise for making this process accessible by bringing expungement lawyers to the community. This effort is creating new opportunities for entire communities who have long felt left behind and forgotten. Despite changes that come with a new administration, it is crucial to continue prioritizing expungement assistance in 2026 and beyond.

The proposals collectively seek to loosen local zoning rules to spur housing construction; change how utilities are regulated and compensated; streamline state government oversight bodies; and repeal thousands of words of education statute lawmakers say are outdated or unused.

Huston made clear, however, that House Republicans do not intend to reopen the state budget.
“This year’s priorities build on efforts advanced in recent years to reduce costs, get government out of the way and grow our economy,” he said.
The session is expected to end by late February — even earlier than usual short sessions  — after lawmakers returned to the Statehouse for two weeks in December to debate a contentious redistricting proposal that ultimately failed to pass.
House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, said that while some of the proposed housing provisions could help reduce rents, Democrats saw limited progress in the GOP agenda.
“It seemed to me, at first glance, it’s pretty lackluster when it comes to trying to save Hoosiers money on their utility bills,” GiaQuinta said. “It doesn’t mention anything with regards to health care or child care. These are issues that we’ve been talking about for a long time now — and it’s not just us, it’s what Hoosiers are looking for.”
Housing supply and local zoning rules
House Bill 1001, authored by Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, targets housing affordability by limiting local zoning regulations and streamlining approvals for new residential development.
Miller, a home builder himself, said Indiana has “constrained supply far too long” through “unnecessary and problematic regulations and restrictions,” contributing to high homeownership costs.
“House Republicans have made it a priority to increase housing stock in the state of Indiana,” Miller said, noting nearly $75 million in housing investments in recent budget cycles. “Yet the costs to own a home — they remain high.”

The bill would allow certain housing uses to be approved without public hearings, cap parking requirements, limit local design standards and require mixed-use or multifamily housing to be permitted in some commercially zoned areas. It also expands allowances for accessory dwelling units, such as backyard or in-law apartments.
Miller said the goal is not to strip authority from local governments, but to work within their existing frameworks.
“We’re not taking decision-making away from local authorities,” he said. “What we’re actually doing is working within the guidelines that they already operate.”
The legislation also requires local governments to begin reporting housing approval data to the state, which Miller said will help identify “bottlenecks.”
“We don’t know what we don’t know,” he said.
GiaQuinta said Democrats are open to parts of the proposal, particularly provisions that could reduce construction costs and lower rents. 
He pointed to requirements tied to building materials and design standards as potential contributors to higher housing prices, but he cautioned lawmakers to closely examine the actual savings and impacts on local control.
“If that can lower costs — and lower (monthly payments) for folks that are living in an apartment — there are probably some things in there that are a good first step,” GiaQuinta said. “But if our goal is to reduce costs, we’re going to have to really take a deep dive and see what the exact savings are going to be.”
Utility accountability and energy affordability
Next up, House Bill 1002, authored by Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, would overhaul how Indiana regulates electric utilities by moving forward with performance-based rate making and multi-year rate plans.
“Indiana’s regulatory structure has served us well for generations,” Shonkwiler said. “But that framework was built for a very different energy era.”
She said that although Indiana’s residential electric rates remain among the lowest in the Great Lakes region, families are still struggling to afford utility bills.

“Hoosiers are still feeling the financial burden of heating, cooling and lighting their homes,” she said. “We are updating our regulatory tools so utilities are held accountable for delivering the outcomes we want: strong reliability, improved resilience and better affordability.”
The bill would tie utility profits to performance metrics such as affordability, service restoration and reliability.
Utilities would additionally be required to place customers on budget billing plans by default — allowing ratepayers to opt out — and would be prohibited from disconnecting service to certain low-income customers during periods of extreme summer heat.
Shonkwiler described the approach as “incremental” but significant for Indiana, which has not previously adopted performance-based regulation at this scale.
“This is about modernizing regulation in a way that still protects consumers,” she said.
Still, GiaQuinta said Democrats remain skeptical that the bill would deliver meaningful or timely savings.
“One thing that we can do right off the bat is suspend the sales tax on utilities,” GiaQuinta suggested. “On electricity alone, that’s about $350 a year. And if you do that on all utilities, that really starts to add up.”
Consolidating boards and commissions
Another measure, House Bill 1003, authored by Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty, proposes repealing, merging or “restructuring” dozens of state boards, commissions and councils.
In its current form, the massive 346-page bill would eliminate 56 state commissions, committees, boards, task forces and councils, according to a legislative fiscal analysis.
“This is a product over three years of work,” Bartels said. A legislative task force debated possible cuts to Indiana’s roster of more than 250 state boards and commissions in November.
“The intent here,” Bartels continued, “is to increase government efficiency and effectiveness.”
While the bill includes “modest cost savings,” he emphasized that money is not the primary goal.
Story continues below.
Dozens of state boards, commissions and councils would be affected by House Bill 1003, authored by Rep. Steve Bartels, R-Eckerty. (List from a legislative fiscal analysis published on Jan. 7, 2026)
“The intent is not necessarily to specifically save money,” Bartels said. “It’s efficiency.”
Huston echoed that view, saying overlapping boards can create confusion and duplicate work.
“You’re creating multiple work streams out of that, and oftentimes those work streams are not even congruent with one another,” Huston said.
The bill also makes sweeping changes to administrative rulemaking, professional licensing and the state building code, transferring some responsibilities to the Indiana Department of Homeland Security, for example.
Some suggestions — including elimination of the Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission — have already been criticized, however.
A representative from the Indiana Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, for example, previously told lawmakers he was concerned about building code decisions and changes being made by state agency staffers or lawmakers without the involvement of the commission, whose members include architects, professional engineers and others with construction experience.
More K-12 education deregulation
Rep. Bob Behning, R-Indianapolis, said his House Bill 1004 continues a multi-year effort to strip unused or outdated language from Indiana’s education code.
“This legislation improves Indiana’s education framework by removing restrictive, redundant and unnecessary statutory requirements,” Behning said.

He added that the bill, as currently drafted, would eliminate more than 19,000 words from state law — following last year’s removal of nearly 35,000 words in a separate deregulation measure — and cleans up conflicting definitions, unused programs and obsolete mandates.
“The goal is really to let education get out of the way, let educators do what they do best,” he said.
Behning noted that the bill would further repeal outdated reporting requirements, remove defunct grant programs and eliminate mandates that “no longer” align with how schools operate, including provisions tied to obsolete technology and programs no longer funded by the state.
Huston called education deregulation one of the House GOP’s most persistent — and challenging — priorities.
“It’s oftentimes asked for, but oftentimes hard to accomplish,” he said. “We want to create a flexible system to do it.”
GiaQuinta told reporters he still needed to review the 168-page bill but questioned the effort.
“Rep. Behning now has been in charge of the education committee since 2011, and he keeps wanting to deregulate the things that he was responsible — and the House Republicans have been responsible — for putting in (state code),” GiaQuinta said. “Maybe they’re correcting the errors of their ways. I don’t really know what the plan is there, so we’ll continue to monitor that.”

Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) after delivering testimony on AB 678. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin school districts would be required to establish policies on appropriate communication between students and staff members before the next school year, under a bill that received a public hearing Thursday. 
The bill comes in reaction to a report from the Capital Times in November that found over 200 investigations into teacher licenses due to allegations of sexual misconduct or grooming from 2018 to 2023. Another bill coauthored by Nedweski, AB 677, making grooming a felony crime in Wisconsin received a public hearing earlier this week.
“Many of these cases begin with the erosion of professional boundaries when a school employee starts communicating with the students inappropriately often outside of school hours and without parent knowledge usually through the use of text messaging and social media,”  Nedweski told the Assembly Education Committee. “While the vast majority of school staff use these tools responsibly, a small number have exploited that access — sometimes leading to devastating consequences.”
AB 678 would require Wisconsin school boards to adopt a policy on appropriate communications between students and employees or volunteers in the school district.
“This bill preserves local control. It does not mandate a one-size-fits-all policy; instead it allows each school district to determine what communication policies work best for its own community,” Nedweski said.
The policies would need to include specific consequences for staff who violate the policy and specify that it applies to communications during and outside of school hours. The policy would need to include standards for appropriate content and methods of communication.
An amendment to the bill, which Nedweski said came at the request of the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI) and other stakeholders, would require annual training for employees on identifying, preventing and reporting grooming and professional boundary violations. 
The Department of Public Instruction has worked with Nedweski on the legislation and supports it. 
“We think this is a good effort to get the conversation started,” Deputy State Superintendent Tom McCarthy said, noting the agency has been working on policy related to appropriate communication for over eight years. He said there are a lot of districts that are using technology for software that allows them to track communications. 
“There’s a bit of a dichotomy with this issue. We know that in order to educate kids we need to foster and build relationships with students and families, and so we do encourage appropriate communication in every school district,” McCarthy said, adding that the policy and training would be critical. “You will find some circumstances where you’re going to want communication and it might not be as neat and tidy as you’d expect it to be. There are always emergency circumstances where a teacher might need to call a student directly… so we want some policies to be flexible to address those areas.” 
Chris Kulow, director of government relations for the Wisconsin Association of School Boards (WASB), said the organization had some concerns about the language in the bill related to consequences. He testified for information only, noting the issue of communication between staff and students is not new to school districts. 
“Although recent news coverage and increased interest from state policymakers may make this appear to be a new issue, it is not new to schools. School boards have long recognized the need for policies addressing appropriate communication and professional boundaries between pupils and staff. Many districts have already adopted such policies,” Kulow said. “This bill may require some districts to update existing policies to reflect its specific language and to the extent it prompts boards to review and strengthen policies is beneficial.” 
Kulow said complying with the provision related to consequences as currently written would be challenging as violations can vary widely and require a wide range of responses. The organization wanted the provision removed, but said Nedweski wanted something related to be included in the bill. 
“Attempting to predetermine specific consequences for every specific scenario may be impractical and could complicate the disciplinary process,” Kulow said. “We suggested revising the language in the bill to read that ‘the school board shall include in the policy a range of consequences up to and including termination.’”
The bill currently only covers Wisconsin public schools, though Nedweski told Democratic lawmakers, who expressed concerns about the bill not including the state’s private voucher schools, that she is working on an amendment. 
“We need to protect all kids. This is such a growing problem. We’ve seen just an increase in inappropriate communication,” Nedweski said.
Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison), also asked whether lawmakers would be open to including funding for school districts to support the implementation of the bill. 
Nedweski said she hasn’t had any requests for funding from schools or the DPI throughout the development of the bill.
“I think it’s a serious enough issue, a weighty enough issue, that all schools can find the resources to craft a policy and do some training to make sure they are protecting children,” Nedweski said, adding that DPI already has modules related to this type of training.
McCarthy said additional funding, including the release of $1 million set aside for the agency in the state budget, could help speed along the process. Those funds, which sit in a supplemental fund, can only be released by the Joint Finance Committee. He said without the funds the agency could potentially have to cut down on staff and other areas of its operations, which could affect how quickly work is done.
Under the bill in its current form, school boards would need to adopt a policy by July 1, 2026. 
McCarthy said DPI would like to see an amendment that would move the deadline for policy adoption to a later date, saying DPI may need a longer “runway” to ensure the agency has time to change and update policies and training if needed. He told the Wisconsin Examiner that some of the changes could be necessary if Nedweski’s grooming bill becomes law. 
Rich Judge, assistant state superintendent for the division of government and public affairs, also noted that school boards would need to have time to meet, develop and approve policies. 
Nedweski said in a written statement to the Examiner that she is taking the agency’s suggestion under consideration and is discussing potential dates. One potential date could be Sept. 1, 2026, she said. 
“If AB 678 is signed into law, the goal is for school districts to have these policies in place for the 2026–27 school year,” Nedweski said. She noted that some of the agency’s concerns are tied to her other bill. “This only underscores the importance of passing AB 677 and getting it signed into law promptly to ensure that districts across Wisconsin can take the necessary steps to better protect students in school.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_174346145-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-09 06:57:01.588651

DemasThe herculean effort to extend lapsed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act tax credits put in place during the COVID era passed in the U.S. House Thursday evening, with enough Republicans voting in favor of the extension to put it over the top.
Michigan’s entire Republican congressional delegation, however, voted against the measure to extend the tax credits for three years.
U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) on Wednesday said that House Democrats needed just a slim margin of support from their Republican colleagues, estimating that four could do it. 
US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote

On Thursday evening, they got support from 17.
They included Reps. Mike Carey (Ohio), Andrew Garbarino (N.Y.), Ryan Mackenzie (Pa.), Mike Lawler (N.Y.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), David Joyce (Ohio), Tom Kean (N.J.), Nick LaLota (N.Y.), Max Miller (Ohio), David Valadao (Calif.), Rob Wittman (Va.), Jeff Hurd (Colo.), Maria Elvira-Salazar (Fla.), Rob Bresnahan (Pa.), Derrick Van Orden (Wis.), Zach Nunn (Iowa) and Monica De La Cruz (Texas).
The 230-196 vote sends the legislation to the Senate, where Republican leadership is unlikely to put it on the floor without considerable changes, which a bipartisan group of senators appears close to finalizing. 
Prior to the vote, Tlaib said she and her fellow Democrats were able to muster a vote through legislative maneuvering that stood “against the will of Trump and Republican leadership.”
“The American people want health care,” Tlaib said in a supplemental post on X. “Not a $1.5 trillion Pentagon budget.”

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) said Congress has ignored the health care cost crisis for more than a year under the current leadership of House Speaker Mike Johnson. 
“Despite the Speaker stonewalling us for months, Republican members joined Democrats to force a vote to extend the tax credits that will save families in our community thousands of dollars per year,” McDonald Rivet said in a statement. “The Senate needs to vote on renewing these tax credits immediately. Every day they delay is another day that doctors’ appointments, cancer screenings, and emergency room visits are out of reach for working people in mid-Michigan.”
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) praised the passage and called it “a big step to protect Michigan families from rising health care costs.” 
“I proudly voted yes to extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies that make coverage more accessible for tens of thousands of Michiganders who rely on it every month,” Stevens said in a statement. “I’ll keep fighting to lower health care costs and make sure no one is priced out of the care they need.”
Also applauding Michigan’s Democratic delegation for helping lead the way was Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel.

“This is what leadership looks like — putting working families first and fighting to make health care affordable,” Hertel said in a statement. “While this was a big, bipartisan win for Michigan families, every Michigan Republican in Congress voted against lowering health care costs, and along with Mike Rogers, have uniformly supported the plan that forced premium hikes on hundreds of thousands of Michiganders at the beginning of the year.”
Hertel was referring to Rogers’ previous time in the U.S. House, as he is not currently serving and did not vote on the tax credit extension.
State Sen. Sean McCann (D-Grand Rapids), who is a candidate to face U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) in the 4th Congressional District race, also praised the passage on Thursday evening.
“As costs continue to rise at the grocery store and the pharmacy, Bill Huizenga has yet again sold Michigan families down the river,” McCann said. “First, he voted for the largest Medicaid cuts in history – and just now, he voted to raise health insurance premiums. We’ve had enough of politicians in DC playing games with peoples’ lives. In Congress, I will work to actually lower costs and expand access to health care for Michigan families.”
Earlier on Thursday, Michigan Families for Fair Care held a press conference in Lansing and urged U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) to vote yes on the measure. The press call also featured Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy, who said while the monetary cost of losing health care access was top of mind for struggling Michiganders, the human cost was also high.
“The human cost is, when someone gets sick, and they don’t have health care, they’re likely to delay their health care,” Stanton said. “And that ultimately means, especially if you have a chronic condition, it’s going to get worse and to potentially a crisis point before you actually access health care.”
Barrett ultimately voted no against the measure.

Health care is too expensive for all of us, but extending broken Obamacare subsidies without reforming them is not the answer. These blank checks to big insurance companies do nothing to actually put patients first, prevent premium hikes, or eliminate the rampant fraud and abuse… pic.twitter.com/zuANeCZz0J
— Congressman Tom Barrett (@RepTomBarrett) January 8, 2026

“The program that Democrats put forward today would advantage the top 1% income earners, on the backs of working-class Americans, and I simply can’t stand behind that,” Barrett said in a statement. “I’m looking for real reforms in health care that will empower patients [and] put more money in your pocket, so that you can choose the health care plan that works for you, while bypassing the health insurance companies for the profitability that they’ve been taking at our advantage.”
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), one of the leading Republican gubernatorial candidates, also voted against the measure. 
In a Facebook post, James accused the Democrats of “flailing” — even though they just netted a huge win — and “selling your health & kids’ futures by extending COVID-era Obamacare handouts to billion-dollar insurers – for just 7% of Americans!”
“My solution: Price transparency for CHEAPER, BETTER healthcare for 100% of Americans!” James wrote. “Dems’ fix: Prop up broken ‘sick-care’ system making us sicker and subsidizing 58k dead people. ACA spiked premiums 80% + billions in tax-funded FRAUD! Don’t let them get away with it.”
In response, the Democratic Governors Association lambasted him and other Republicans in gubernatorial races across the country.
“Today, every Republican in Congress running for governor once again voted to jack up costs and turn their backs on the residents of their states who are already facing skyrocketing health insurance premiums this year,” the association said in a statement. “Donald Trump and Republicans’ disastrous budget law was a major vulnerability for Republican candidates who got blown out of the water in New Jersey and Virginia in 2025, and this vote ensures those headwinds are going to be even worse in governors races across the country in 2026.”

Wyoming could leave $800M on the table if it doesn't implement the  proposals outlined in its application. 
The post What’s at stake if Wyoming lawmakers don’t act on $205M proposal to improve rural health? appeared first on WyoFile .","Though Wyoming only learned last week it will receive $205 million in federal rural health funds this year, the state doesn’t have a lot of time to idle over the money, Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson explained to lawmakers Tuesday.
That’s because Wyoming risks blowing an opportunity for $800 million in additional program funds if it does not fully spend the initial allotment, fails to implement the proposed policy actions in its application or goes rogue with other measures, according to the health department. 
“The Trump administration has been very clear with us that anything outside of these approved purposes that are within our application risks clawback from the federal government,” Johansson told the Joint Appropriations Committee during a Tuesday budget hearing.
The health department needs legislative action to advance some of its rural health plans with steps like approving funding expenditures and drafting a bill that would create a permanent, investment-generated revenue fund. 
So in a roundabout way, the federal funds are applying pressure on lawmakers to advance multiple initiatives aimed at supporting health care access in the state. And those include some measures that Wyoming’s small-government conservatives are wary of — like a state-run health insurance plan.
Committee Chairman Rep. John Bear of Gillette, who is a member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, criticized that insurance proposal in earlier talks. On Tuesday, he paid the department a barbed compliment. 
“You all have done an excellent job of, I’m going to call it, twisting the arm of the federal government, to get this thing through,” he said. “Stuff that I think our staff and us were kind of surprised that you were able to get accomplished. So, well done in that regard.” 
Regardless, lawmakers will move forward on related actions, Bear said. 
“We certainly are taking this up as a matter of legislative action, so we’ll be working on this, and we’ll keep in touch with you to make sure we get it right,” he said. 
Wyoming’s award
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a new federal initiative created by President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The program will funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. 
The application process for states unfolded rapidly. In Wyoming, Department of Health staff held stakeholder conferences and 11 public meetings starting in September to gather input. The state received 1,300 responses to an online survey it circulated. Staff prepared an 84-page application and submitted it by the Nov. 5 deadline.

The application proposed an array of initiatives to bolster health care. They include incentives for small rural hospitals to provide basic services and cut extraneous ones that can be performed at regional facilities; grants for clinical workforce training programs and five-year commitments from grads; a state-run insurance plan for catastrophic events; and permanent, investment-generated revenue to boost the industry.
Wyoming applied for an initial budget of $200 million. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced Dec. 29 that all 50 states will receive awards in 2026 under the program. Wyoming got $5 million more than it requested and received the second-largest award per capita, behind Alaska. 
Now, the work begins. In Wyoming, it will require drafting contracts, hiring staff, crafting bills and gaining legislative approval. On Tuesday, health department staff came before the appropriations committee with an outline of where they think money could be best spent and a draft bill to establish the perpetuity fund. 
A path to sustainability 
Even among health care advocates who view the federal program as a major opportunity for Wyoming, there has been concern about the temporary nature of the funds not being able to fix long-term problems here. 
To address that issue, Wyoming proposed the establishment of the “Wyoming Health Transformation Perpetuity” — an actively managed investment account designed to generate long-term revenue. 
“The state stands to receive over a billion dollars through this program,” Johansson said Tuesday. “That’s a lot of money, and that’s something we take seriously. And so what we hope you see designed into our application is a priority around how to sustain that.”

The perpetuity vehicle would allow the state to stretch the federal benefits into the future to meaningfully address some of Wyoming’s historically intractable health care challenges, Johansson said, such as hospital and EMS viability and workforce retention. 
The bill draft would establish both the fund and rules for how the money is managed and used. 
Johansson emphasized that this specific part of the proposal can unlock a great deal of potential.  
“I know I sound like a used-car salesman here,” he told lawmakers, but “I think this could be truly transformative to some of the problems we have in our rural communities with health care. The idea is that we invest a smaller amount each year, so that over time, instead of five years of benefits, we’re going to accrue decades of benefits.”
There will also be some time-limited funds, Johansson said, which would be allocated to one-time grant programs related to technology adoption, integrated primary care and exercise and diet promotion. 
The appropriations committee is scheduled to revisit the perpetuity bill during its Jan. 15 meeting. 
BearCare
The proposal in Wyoming’s application that has drawn the most attention is the state-run public catastrophic insurance plan. 
As proposed, the plan, dubbed “BearCare,” would cover health care emergencies, such as a car crash or a bear attack, for dues-paying members. The department has pitched it as low-premium, high-deductible coverage that could be useful for major health emergencies, but doesn’t cover typical care.
Gov. Mark Gordon lauded the proposal in his budget letter, calling it “an innovative, but basic, health benefit plan that offers individuals and small businesses a practical alternative to costly ObamaCare insurance.”
Appropriations lawmakers were skeptical the first time BearCare came up in a meeting in early December, and retained wariness Tuesday. 
“We have the state stepping in and competing with private business on an unfair level,” said Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan. “And I’ve always been of the impression that it was the responsibility of the state to provide a level playing field so that anybody who wanted to build a business could build a business. So philosophically, I have a real problem right there.”

However, the plan also emerges as thousands of Wyomingites are facing huge spikes in health insurance costs with the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax subsidies. 
The proposal is not designed to replace an Affordable Care Act Plan, Johansson said.
Instead, he said, “it’s an alternative, in a way, that is a very different type of product that says, ‘if you are choosing to go uninsured as an individual, here is something at a lower cost that would protect you against those larger financial issues.’”
The concept, he continued, “was intriguing enough to the federal government, to the Trump administration, to say, ‘hey, while all this is going on with these expiring ACA subsidies …  here’s one state that’s at least considering an alternative to cover this.’”
He added that the BearCare proposal is a very small component of the state’s application and proposed budget — it would require about 1.4% of the overall allocation. 
However, he said, lawmakers will have the final say. 
“I’ll state unequivocally, we will not stand up that program without legislative authorization,” Johansson said.

Tim Sheehy, Rep. Ryan Zinke, and Rep. Troy Downing, as well as Arkansas Rep. Bruce Westerman — after signing H.J.Res. 104, rolling back a BLM rule which prohibited future coal leasing in eastern Montana. There are many good reasons our government is based on three “separate but equal branches.”  The men who wrote our Constitution 250 years ago had just fought a bloody war against an incredibly powerful monarch whose empire was based on extracting wealth in all its forms from merciless colonial exploitation of weaker nations. 
Few expected the victory of those brave men and women that gave birth to a new nation.  A nation of people free from the dictates of a monarch – and designed to preserve that freedom through carefully crafted “checks and balances” that would assure no one branch of government could trample the people or their Constitution underfoot. 
Yet now those checks and balances have been abandoned in favor of so-called “loyalty” to one political party over the long-standing mandate to ensure the branches of government remain separate and diligent in their primary function to serve the people and govern true to the Constitution. 
The excesses of one-party rule have long been known from the actual history of what has happened here in Montana — and now in the nation — when one party dominates all three branches of government.  In short, the checks and balances on which this nation was founded disappear into the sordid hole of party politics. 
When a president decides to become a Mad Emperor, it is the Legislative branch – Congress – which is charged with countering actions that abuse and ignore the rule of domestic and international laws and make a mockery of Constitutional governance. 
But when Congress is cowed into submission, that fealty to the Constitution, which all members swear to uphold in their Oath of Office, is sacrificed — not for the benefit the populace, but for the benefit of a political party and its brutal leader.
Stephen Miller, the president’s deputy chief of staff, plainly laid out his vision for how the world, and our nation, should work.  Namely, by what he called the “iron law of power, control, and dominance.”  
Of course you won’t find that “law” anywhere but in Miller’s fevered mind.  And it’s a long ways from participatory democracy and the duty of Congress to check the extremes of the Executive Branch. 
Unfortunately, Congress, and Montana’s entire congressional delegation, are complicit in that dereliction of duty and violation of their Oath of Office. 
Given that three of Montana’s four members of Congress are veterans, it seems they have confused being in the military – where the “Commander in Chief” gives the orders and they obey – and being in Congress, which is specifically charged with serving the people, not whomever sits in the Oval Office.
That distinction is critical to the functioning of the nation which, by most measures, isn’t doing all that well right now as citizens struggle to feed, clothe and shelter themselves and our families.  
Add to that the wide international condemnation being directed to the actions of an out-of-control president whose avarice now extends to openly confiscating the resources of sovereign nations, deposing their leaders through military force, and threatening traditional allies with similar actions in violation of international law. 
There’s still time to bring honor to the positions Montana’s congressional delegation holds.  But that requires acknowledging that Stephen Miller’s “iron law” doesn’t exist in law or the Constitution and has no place among the community of nations in the 21st Century.  
Your sworn duty is not to the president and his toadies, it’s to “We the People” — and that call to duty could not be more pressing as our democracy now hangs by the thinnest of threads.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/G77nYVkWgAAXcCZ-1024x683.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 06:57:01.588651

Feral horses have long been part of the Wyoming landscape, but not without consequences for the land and wildlife, writes columnist Walt Gasson.
The post And the horses we rode in on appeared first on WyoFile .","My grandson says I’m a sucker for a flashy horse. He should know. He was with me, branding calves with a friend, when I got completely carried away watching a Tobiano paint horse with feet like a dancer. He was there as well when I fell in love with a big gray foxtrotter with the smoothest gait I’ve ever seen. I plead guilty as charged. I have always loved horses, especially beautiful horses.

Opinion

But if you go back a couple of generations, the horses that my family rode were far from beautiful. The little rangy, hammer-headed mustangs that my grandfather Walt rode didn’t come from some posh horse sale or from some fancy bloodline. They came from the desert, on the business end of a lariat. They were feral horses, perfectly adapted for a good life in a hard country. They were survivors, and their descendants have remained such to this day. 
I do not remember a time in my life when feral horses weren’t present. They were there at Elk Butte and Little Sandy Creek when I was barely tall enough to see out of the pickup window. There were feral horses in Salt Wells Creek and over toward Pine Mountain, south of Rock Springs. There were feral horses near Oregon Buttes and down toward Steamboat Mountain. Never a lot at one time, usually a stud with a small bunch of mares and their offspring. They were skittish, for the most part, and quick to put some distance between themselves and humans. They were iconic, in a way — very much a part of the wild desert country my family called home.
But over time, things changed. Beginning in the 1970s, we began to see more feral horses in more places. You could read brands on some — somebody’s pet that they couldn’t afford to keep and couldn’t bear to put down. I even saw a feral mule east of Continental Peak one day. And every year, there were more. It was apparent that they were fast becoming a problem. And the problem remains to this day.
Here are a few things we know about feral horses:

Wyoming has a lot of free-ranging horses. We’re second only to Nevada in feral horse numbers. We have 16 herd management areas, mostly in southwestern Wyoming and the Bighorn Basin. 


They’re not wildlife. They’re domestic horses released to the wild accidentally or on purpose, now feral. Any other origin story for them is fantasy. Multiple species of horses existed in North America, but they’ve been extinct for at least 10,000 years.


They’re physically resilient and adaptable. Their anatomy (prehensile lips, narrow muzzle, long legs, single-chamber stomach) and their ability to shift what they eat in response to changing conditions (drought, severe winters, etc.) make them successful competitors with native wildlife, like sage grouse, pronghorn, mule deer, elk and bighorn sheep.


They’re behaviorally resilient and adaptable as well. When resources like water are plentiful, they don’t spend a lot of energy defending those resources. But when those same resources are scarce, they aggressively defend their territories, limiting access to resources by those same native wildlife species.


Their numbers were kept in check for more than a century by harvest from Indigenous people, and later by ranchers and other rural folks for their own purposes. Stockmen across the interior west captured young horses for domestication and shipped other captive feral horses to market for slaughter.


The Wild Free‐Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 was a game-changer. With the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service tasked with the responsibility to manage feral horses on their lands, free-ranging horse numbers have risen to approximately three times the appropriate management levels established.


At current population levels, feral horses are damaging habitat for many species of native wildlife. As the impacts of climate changes continue, this damage will increase.

Out there on the ground, the future looks grim for both these hardy critters and the habitat they depend upon. Feral horse numbers on the range continue to increase. Holding facilities are full. Adoption programs account for only a small number of horses annually. The federal agencies have turned to off-range sites, usually on private lands, where the owner contracts to take a given number of horses for a given time and receives compensation. There are now almost as many free-ranging horses off-range as there are in the wild. Meanwhile, free-ranging horse numbers continue to rise.
It would be easy to pin this on the BLM and Forest Service. Wyoming folks reflexively blame the feds, when given the opportunity. But I don’t think they are the problem. The problem is the Wild Free‐Roaming Horses and Burros Act. It has been around for over 50 years. The original intent was to protect feral horses and burros from abuse and ensure a place for viable populations of them on the public lands of the West. By any measure, that mission has long been accomplished. 
It’s time for a change out on the range. Three simple recommendations:

Reduce horse numbers to the existing appropriate management levels by executive order, if necessary. Those levels were developed collaboratively, using the best science available at the time. 


If we need to change appropriate management levels, change them. And monitor population levels closely, using the best available science. 


Increase emphasis on sterilization of free-roaming horses to keep populations at appropriate management levels.

This is a stewardship issue. It’s not about the romance of the animals. It’s not about the feelings of their advocates or their critics. It’s about both the horses and the native wildlife. Most importantly, it’s about the native landscapes of the West we hold in trust for future generations.

(Photo by Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)The massive federal tax and spending package, called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” approved by Congress in July will impact state budgets next year — but less than a week ahead of the Idaho legislative session and the beginning of state budget-setting, lawmakers are not sure the extent of cuts the bill could result in. 
The federal tax changes could reduce Idaho’s revenue significantly in the near-term. However, it’s unclear by how much, as recent estimates cited by several state officials range from $115 million to around $400 million. 
Asked about discrepancies between estimates, officials cited factors such as complexity of federal versus state tax laws, unanswered questions about definitions in the federal bill regarding some of the provisions, and the potential for people to report their income in new ways to pay lower taxes.

“I think it’s somewhere between $180 million and maybe $240 million, somewhere in there, and probably closer to $220 million. But that’s just a guess, like everybody else is doing,” House Speaker Mike Moyle said at a press conference Thursday. “And until we know those definitions and how it’s going to apply, we just have to guess.” 
The state is facing a projected $40 million deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and an estimated $600 million to $1 billion deficit for the coming fiscal year.
Little will submit his proposed budget on Jan. 12, the first day of the 2026 legislative session. 
A spokesperson for Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s told the Idaho Capital Sun that the governor “is proactively assessing the impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill and coordinating closely with state agencies to ensure Idaho remains fiscally responsible and well-positioned moving forward.”

 Estimated cost of federal tax conformity in Idaho vary widely 

Idaho lawmakers typically approve an annual tax conformity bill, which aligns Idaho’s tax codes with the federal Internal Revenue Code, early in the year with limited fanfare or debate. However, with the major federal policy change, this year’s vote will include decisions regarding new tax policies such as no taxes on workers’ tips, no taxes on overtime for some workers, and no taxes on interest on auto loans. All of these decisions may reduce Idaho’s revenue. 
The Idaho State Tax Commission as of Jan. 8 has estimated the state would lose between $115.6 million and $193.3 million of revenue the first year with almost all the federal charges, according to an analysis received through a public records request. 
In July, the nonprofit national tax policy organization the Tax Foundation estimated Idaho would see a  $284 million cut in revenue if lawmakers adopt all Big Beautiful Bill tax changes. Another report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy noted that the Tax Foundation’s estimate did not include provisions related to bonus depreciation, which is one area of the tax code where Idaho does not follow federal policies. 
Idaho legislators hope to set revenue projection early to tackle budget, revenue shortfalls

If the state did opt to re-align itself with federal bonus depreciation, the cost could be as high as $435.4 million, the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy estimated. 
Moyle said Thursday he’s seen estimates as high as $800 million, but did not say where he saw that estimate. Earlier this week, Moyle told the Sun the cost could be closer to $400 million. 
Little said at the same event Thursday that his office would unveil its own calculation but didn’t elaborate on what it would be. Asked why the spread among predictions was so large, the governor responded, “it’s really quite complicated.” 
The top House Democrat, Minority Leader Rep. Ilana Rubel, Boise, also emphasized the uncertainty of the potential number, but expressed more concern about it. 
“Frankly, it’s a dynamic situation, because people have some flex and how they can characterize compensation,” Rubel said. “And there’s going to be a lot of incentive under this to characterize things that used to be salary as tips … I don’t like jumping off ledges where I can’t see where the bottom is.” 
 Idaho lawmakers need to agree on revenue number to set budget

Idaho’s Constitution requires the state to balance a budget, but to do that, lawmakers must estimate the revenue it will receive to balance it against. Whatever decision is made on tax conformity will impact that revenue number. 
Republican legislative leaders on Thursday expressed support for adopting most of the federal tax changes, although maybe not all. 
Moyle said “there’s no way in heck” he would oppose the changes such as eliminating taxes on some overtime and tip income and the increased senior senior deduction. Moyle said that because the state left a buffer in its budget last year, that the budget would be “in good shape.” 
“We’re going to have to guess, which I hate to say, but that’s what we’re going to do,” Moyle said. “We’re going to guess what the number (is), and we’re going to walk out of here with a balanced budget.” 
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate on Thursday expressed much more skepticism about the cost of conforming. 
“I wish we wouldn’t even be in the position that we had to question conformity. We always conform,” Senate Minority Leader Melissa Wintrow, D-Boise, said. 
Rubel noted the state is already facing a projected budget deficit. 
“The first rule of holes is when you’re in one, stop digging,” Rubel. 
 What are other states doing to prepare? 

Other states are facing revenue reductions as well. 
In early December, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox included in his proposed budget an estimated revenue cut of $500 million in the next two years from federal tax conformity, Utah News Dispatch reported. 
Cox announced the state intended to comply with the tax changes. 
Under Trump tax cuts, Utah won’t collect $500 million in income taxes in 2026, 2027

Pew Research in late November published an analysis of different states’ approaches to preparing for the impact of the federal legislation, which is also known as “H.R. 1.” 
“Special sessions have been one way (states are preparing),” said Justin Theal, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center. “Another way has been, state leaders really leaning on special committees and task forces that existed prior to the passage of H.R. 1, but have all of a sudden become front and center in terms of really informing what the impact of these federal changes will be on the state’s overall fiscal trajectory.” 
New Mexico had already established its Federal Funding Stabilization Subcommittee, Theal said, but later opted to use the subcommittee to evaluate the federal budget package’s potential impact. Vermont had an existing task force that in July published a report on declining federal transfers, and although it was compiled before the passage of the federal budget bill, leaders there are using the report to inform their response, Theal said. 
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis in August called lawmakers back into a special session to address the estimated $800 million budget shortfall from the tax provisions in the federal budget package, Colorado Newsline reported. 
Across the state, Theal said he both saw these proactive approaches as well as some states opting to wait and see. He said he saw some states using stress tests similar to those used by large banks to understand how a big shock to the system may affect their ability to balance budgets. 
“Traditionally, those things are used for events like a recession,” Theal said, “but states are increasingly using them to kind of game out what a sudden loss of federal funds might mean.”

Thursday’s candlelight vigil was at least the third event held in Nashville to honor Good a day after her killing was captured in widely circulated videos. Scores of similar vigils and protests took place across the nation. 
“We grieve with them as they grieve the loss of a neighbor and loved one,” Rev. Eric Mailey, pastor of Edgehill United Methodist Church, told the crowd gathered after sunset.  “No matter where you are, everyone deserves to be safe.”

But like others who spoke at the Nashville vigil – among them, faith and community leaders, and immigrant advocates  – Mailey called Good’s death an act of political violence and laid blame on the Trump administration for “perpetuating and normalizing” terror on the nation’s streets.
“Until we get them out of our communities, the violence will continue to escalate,” he said. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has characterized Good’s death as the result of a justifiable and defensive shooting. In a post on X, the department accused Good of being a domestic terrorist who “weaponized her vehicle” in an attempt to run down ICE agents. 
But the Trump administration has provided no support for its allegations of domestic terrorism against Good, and bystander video appears to contradict its claims of how the incident unfolded. 
Elected officials in Tennessee also weighed in Thursday. 
U.S. Congressman Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Memphis, called the incident “deeply disturbing.”  
Cohen said the incident “raises serious concerns for communities like Memphis,” where hundreds of outside law enforcement officers, including ICE agents and the Tennessee National Guard, were dispatched on the president’s orders to “restore law and order.”
“We grieve with them as they grieve the loss of a neighbor and loved one,” Pastor Eric Mailey of Edgehill Methodist Church told the crowd in Nashville. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
State Rep. Justin Pearson, also a Memphis Democrat, called Good’s death “horrifying, tragic and a direct consequence of the authoritarian policies of the Trump administration.”
“This is what happens when our government chooses to intimidate its people and treat entire communities like suspects under the guise of ‘restoring order,’” he said. 
In a statement on X, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Tennessee Republican, called upon Americans to “pray for our ICE patriots.”
“If you put an ICE agent in mortal danger, self-defense is JUSTIFIED,” he wrote.
Thursday’s vigil was organized by the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition, Nashville Indivisible, SEUI Local 205, Tennessee Advocates for Planned Parenthood, Conexion Americas, Tennessee Justice for our Neighbors and others.

Jeff Landry, center, as Landry leaves the House Chamber after speaking on opening day of legislative session, Monday, April 14, 2025, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. (Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)Gov. Jeff Landry has the power to appoint three more members to the Louisiana Board of Ethics this year, giving him control over the majority of the entity that enforces campaign finance and government transparency laws. 
Three of the 15 board members’ terms expired Jan. 1. The governor controls all seats now open to new appointees. He selected five new members last year. Appointing three more would give him a slim majority of eight members. 

Outgoing board members Alfred “Butch” Speer and Anne Banos, appointees of former Gov. John Bel Edwards, stepped down in December. The term for member Jacqueline Scott, also an Edwards appointee, has also ended, but she plans to remain on the board until Landry replaces her, state Ethics Administrator David Bordelon said Thursday. 
Landry’s office said announcements about new ethics board members might come Friday. Bordelon said the ethics staff hadn’t received notice of any new appointments yet.

Landry, who has clashed with the board in the past, has more control over its members than his predecessors. In 2024, he pushed through a law that reworked the board selection process to give the governor more influence. 
He also expanded the board from 11 to 15 members last year, with the number of seats the governor gets to pick going from seven to nine. State lawmakers appoint the remaining six members, up from four under the previous structure. 
More significantly, the governor and legislators get to appoint members directly to the board, although the governor’s appointees are required to receive state Senate confirmation. Previously, the governor and lawmakers could only select ethics board members from a list of nominees provided by leaders at Louisiana’s private colleges and universities. These college leaders were included in the selection process to insulate the board members from political pressure, but Landry removed that attempt at a firewall. 
The change upset government transparency advocates, who said it weakened the ethics board’s independence. 
As a concession to those concerns, there is a recommendation in the new law — but not a requirement — that the board be made up of five retired judges, five other retired elected officials and five people who have never served in public office.

The ethics board currently includes three retired judges: Vanessa Whipple, John Crigler and Joel Davis. Three retired elected officials — Jason Amato, Mike Huval and Rick Nowlin — also hold seats. All except Huval, a Louisiana House of Representatives appointee, were chosen by Landry last year. 
Until recently, Landry and the ethics board were in a standoff over the governor’s failure to disclose trips he had taken on private planes owned by campaign donors while he held public office. 
In September, the ethics board dropped charges it filed against Landry in 2023, when he was attorney general, for failing to disclose trips he took on a donor’s private plane. In exchange, Landry paid a $900 fine and publicly admitted to 19 instances in which he had accepted rides on private planes without publicly reporting them. 
In the past, the board has also told Landry in private letters to stop using money from his political accounts to pay off his vehicle and a Washington, D.C., gym membership. But earlier this year, the governor and lawmakers approved a law that now allow for some of this previously restricted spending.

[…],"Springdale-based Tyson Foods has said the company will not renew contracts with Northwest Arkansas poultry growers in response to ongoing litigation regarding poultry litter polluting the Illinois River. (Photo by Evey Weisblat/Arkansas Advocate)A federal judge fining Tyson Foods and other large poultry companies for polluting the Illinois River is part of a decades-long legal fight that prompted the Springdale-based company to deem the watershed “no longer a hospitable place to do business.”  
The declaration was surprising for a company whose history is deeply entrenched in the region. Tyson is Springdale’s largest single employer, and its fingerprints are everywhere. Employees can shop for discounted meats and ready-to-eat frozen meals at the company store. A vintage neon sign depicting a chick hatching from an egg adorns the brick facade of Tyson’s original headquarters. Signs featuring Tyson’s red and yellow logo are inescapable throughout its hometown.
The city recently handed Tyson a 50% tax break for its $127 million plan to revive a shuttered Springdale poultry plant. At the same time, Tyson threatened to stop contracting with local poultry farmers because of the looming threat of legal fines.   
The tax write-off and Tyson’s simultaneous decision to withdraw from local contracts shows the balancing act the nation’s largest processed chicken manufacturer is performing as it fights a costly environmental lawsuit. And it explains why locals are wary of directly blaming the company for its stance.
Report outlines Nebraska financial hit from Tyson plant exit

In Arkansas, Tyson dominates the market through contracts with broiler farmers who raise chickens to process at its facilities. Without Tyson, many growers in the watershed, which includes northwest Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma, could face immediate bankruptcy, a scenario that played out recently in Missouri and central Arkansas when Tyson abruptly closed processing plants there, leaving farmers without a buyer. 
Tyson’s decision to step back from contracts in the region came roughly three weeks prior to a Dec. 19 ruling, which ordered the poultry giant to clean up decades of phosphorus pollution that has damaged the Illinois River watershed as a result of chicken litter being applied in large quantities to broiler farms. 
About two weeks before the ruling, the Arkansas Farm Bureau held an emergency meeting with over 100 poultry growers and state lawmakers from Arkansas and Oklahoma in response to Tyson’s comments. In a statement, Bureau President Dan Wright warned the loss of contracts could threaten the livelihoods of poultry farmers throughout the watershed.
Jerry Moyer, owner of PLR Farms in Lincoln, said he will be left with $200,000 in debt if Tyson does not renew his contracts when they expire in 2028. 
“There’s growers that will have $4-6 million worth of debt to be paid and that’s devastating to their families,” Moyer said in a Dec. 3 video. “The growers that are left with large debt, they’re going to file bankruptcy and walk away.”   
The bureau, however, isn’t blaming Tyson over the loss of contracts. The blame is being laid squarely on Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, thanks to the 20-year-old lawsuit he has aggressively pursued an end to over the past three years. 
Two decades, one lawsuit 
The Oklahoma v. Tyson Foods litigation began in 2005 when the state sued large poultry companies for disposing tons of phosphorus-rich chicken litter on lands that drained into the Illinois River watershed. 
Drummond oversaw settlement talks after Oklahoma U.S. District Judge Gregory Frizzell ruled in favor of the state in 2023, determining the poultry companies were responsible for polluting the river basin and causing widespread algae blooms that have not improved. The companies, including Tyson, Cargill, George’s, Simmons Foods and Cal-Maine, challenged that ruling, but lost again when Frizzell reaffirmed the court’s initial findings but did not issue a final remedy.   
Following failed settlement talks, Frizzell issued a final judgement Dec. 19. The ruling mandates a comprehensive cleanup plan lasting at least 30 years, overseen by a court-appointed “special master” and funded entirely by the poultry companies with a starting balance of $10 million. Tyson was ordered to pay the largest share of $420,000 in fines levied for past violations, and the decision places new limits on waste per acre.

The judgment is less severe than what Drummond — who is running for governor in 2026 — proposed in July, when he asked for more than $100 million in penalties. Drummond’s proposal was met with intense backlash, and the Oklahoma and Arkansas Farm Bureaus urged Drummond to soften his demands in light of Tyson’s threats to pull grower contracts. 
“The livelihoods of Arkansas and Oklahoma poultry farmers within the Illinois River Watershed are being threatened by an extreme overreach by the Oklahoma attorney general,” Wright said in a statement. Oklahoma Farm Bureau President Stacy Simunek urged Drummond to “go back to the drawing board to reach a reasonable settlement.” 
Drummond has faced escalating pressure from Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who ahead of the ruling urged the AG to settle and accused Drummond of “prioritizing the interests of out-of-state trial lawyers” over Oklahoma farmers.
Tyson said in late November it would halt new contracts in the watershed, blaming Drummond for creating a legal environment that made the region inhospitable to business. The poultry giant said it would honor existing contracts, but not extend them beyond their current terms.
Drummond called Tyson’s threats a “coordinated misinformation campaign” designed to avoid taking responsibility for decades of pollution.
“Not one single farmer has been sued by the state, but these corporations continue to hide behind a false narrative, using hardworking farm families as human shields to avoid accountability,” Drummond said in a news release.    
Tyson’s shiny new investment
Just 24 hours before declaring the region too risky for business, Tyson secured a massive deal to expand its operations in Springdale with the acquisition of a turkey processing plant.  
The deal relies on Act 9 industrial development bonds, where the city takes technical ownership of the plant and leases it back to Tyson through a PILOT (payment in lieu of taxes) agreement. This arrangement allows the company to pay discounted “rent” on its $127 million investment rather than full property taxes for 10 years, after which time Tyson will take ownership of the plant. Based on Washington County property tax rates, a 50% reduction and the project’s $127 million valuation, the Advocate estimates the deal will save Tyson more than $6.5 million over the next decade.   
Springdale could not verify these projected savings. Springdale Deputy Chief of Staff Anna McKinney declined to comment when asked if the city had independently calculated Tyson’s expected tax savings, or what the city’s expected property tax revenue would be before approving the deal. Instead, she referred the questions to the company. 
Tyson accounting executive Jan Nash told McKinney in a Dec. 10 email that the company’s communications team “prefer that we do not comment on the estimated savings.” Nash also noted “that Tyson has closed on the property, which is our initial investment.”    
Tyson did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.
City officials were content to move forward with the deal based solely on verbal assurances from Tyson. In response to a public records request, the only document the city could produce besides the public agreement documents was a letter to Springdale’s mayor and city council from Springdale Public Schools Superintendent Jared Cleveland, expressing support for the bond deal. While acknowledging that tax exemptions “must be used judiciously,” Cleveland said Tyson’s leadership had assured him the arrangement would “meet or exceed” existing property tax revenues for the school district.  
He described Springdale’s relationship to Tyson as “symbiotic.”  
“The history of Springdale is written in tandem with the history of Tyson Foods,” Cleveland wrote. “We understand a fundamental truth: A strong Tyson Foods means a strong Springdale, and a strong Springdale creates a thriving School District.” 
That relationship runs so deep that city officials again deferred to the company when asked to explain their confidence in the deal, given that it lacks any provisions which would protect the city’s tax base if Tyson were to suddenly jump ship or not create the jobs it promised. 
Tyson would “be better equipped to answer” these questions, McKinney said in a Dec. 29 email. Tyson has not responded to the questions forwarded by the city.

The plant Tyson bought was formerly owned by Cargill, but the company shuttered it in August. The 350,000-square-foot facility, located on 45 acres in Springdale’s industrial corridor, had operated for over 50 years and employed about 1,000 people, Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse said. In a Dec 5. interview, he described the closure as a “punch in the gut” and said he was relieved when Tyson said it was interested in buying the facility through a tax-free bond.
“Nothing’s really a no-brainer, but I thought this was as close to a no-brainer from a city’s perspective because the city is not on the hook for any of these bonds,” Sprouse said. “This will all be on Tyson.” 
Tyson officials proposed renovating the Cargill plant and retrofitting it into a chicken packaging facility. Nathan McKay, Tyson’s president of poultry, said the company plans major capital investments over the next three years to upgrade equipment. They would hire about 200 employees in the first few years of operation, and gradually add more.  
The Springdale City Council approved the bond, and Drummond cited the acquisition as evidence Tyson was bluffing about withdrawing from contracts in the watershed.
“Oklahomans deserve better than corporate intimidation tactics from a company that has repeatedly shown it prioritizes profits over people and environmental responsibility,” Drummond said.
Sprouse said he had not spoken with Tyson about the company’s threats to pull back from local contracts before or after the city council approved the tax incentives. 
“I know well enough to know that’s not something they want to do,” Sprouse said. At the same time, he pleaded ignorance about other aspects of Tyson’s business strategy, stating he “would have no clue” about Drummond’s claims Tyson was bluffing. 
Sprouse said he hopes local growers can still operate and indicated he trusted Tyson’s decision-making process. 
 “I don’t know what all’s going into those decisions, and I’ll trust those in charge to decide what they need to do,” he said.
The path forward
Drummond left open the door to negotiations that could offer “more flexibility and certainty” than the judge’s plan. He cautioned against appealing the ruling noting it would only prolong the decades-long legal proceedings. 
“A robust poultry industry and clean water can and must coexist,” Drummond said in a press release. “I remain committed to working with the poultry companies toward a resolution.”
Officials decry judge’s ruling against poultry companies in Oklahoma and Arkansas

Attorneys for Tyson and the other poultry firms have asked the judge to stay his ruling as they appeal it. 
Arkansas Farm Bureau’s president lambasted the judge’s decision, arguing the farming standards imposed by his ruling represent an “arbitrary benchmark” that will force large poultry companies to withdraw from the watershed. 
“Ultimately, this ruling is a gross overreach and seeks to provide a solution to a problem that no longer exists,” Wright stated.
Arkansas and Oklahoma lawmakers, including Stitt, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and legislators representing Benton and Washington counties, also criticized Frizzell’s judgement. Sanders said the case has created “unnecessary harm” to poultry growers.
Save The Illinois River, an environmental stewardship group that was among the minority who praised the final judgment, said the poultry companies should be held responsible for polluting the watershed. 
“It’s time to quit playing politics and economically threatening our farmers, our communities, and the future of our children,” president Paul Rowsey said in a statement. “The time is now to act responsibly and remediate past transgressions and to mitigate future ones.”

(Courtesy of Denver Public Library Special Collections, X-23704)Though Colorado was on the verge of statehood in early 1876, it wouldn’t have a Capitol building for almost another 20 years. It fell to John Taffe, the territorial secretary, to rent two large rooms at a Lawrence Street building owned by the Odd Fellows fraternal order, a space praised by the Denver Times as “the best ever obtained for the Legislature (and) not more than ordinarily expensive.”
 

This story is part of Colorado at 150, featuring special reports on the people and history that define the state.


There was relatively little business for the Legislature, which consisted of a 13-seat upper chamber called the Council and a 26-seat House of Representatives, to transact during its 40-day session.
The territorial government collected about $90,000 a year in tax revenue, which was doled out to institutions like the penitentiary in Cañon City, the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind, and two new public colleges established in 1874, the Colorado School of Mines and the University of Colorado at Boulder.
Among the session’s more controversial proposals was a bill to appropriate funds for a delegation to be sent to the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia later that year.
“If we had thirty or forty millions in our treasury we could as well splurge out with $20,000 as not. It would then be very well to send a committee of five or six who want to visit their friends in the east, and the Centennial, and have a good time at the expense of the territory,” a Denver correspondent wrote to the Pueblo Chieftain. “We are not yet financially situated to indulge in any very extravagant movements in a Centennial direction, or in any other direction.”

But in January 1876 there were, as the Chieftain put it, “three houses” in session in Denver, and the third and most important body met a few blocks away, at the corner of 15th and Blake streets, on the third floor of the First National Bank building. The chambers of Colorado’s constitutional convention were adorned for the occasion with American flags, landscapes of both Pikes Peak and Long’s Peak, and portraits of Washington, Lincoln, President Ulysses S. Grant and frontiersman Kit Carson.
In December the convention had organized itself into committees and hired its officers, including secretaries and sergeants-at-arms. The selection of Clay Forbes, a Black man, as the convention’s fireman, tasked with keeping the hall warm, was characterized by The Rocky Mountain News as “an earnest of a good bill of rights in the new constitution.” David F. Wilkins of Las Animas County was appointed as the convention’s Spanish interpreter, continuing a practice that had begun in the territorial assembly.
On Jan. 8, Gov. John Routt, the members of the three houses and other territorial leaders held a grand joint banquet at Denver’s Guard Hall, where nearly 300 guests paid three dollars apiece to enjoy “chef-d’oeuvres of French cookery” prepared by Jacques Charpiot, proprietor of the Cafe Denver.
“More elaborate preparation for satisfying the inner needs of man was probably never seen on such an extensive scale in the territory,” reported the News, “and the corps of waiters, who were to be the Ganymedes of the occasion, formed quite a small army.”
An anonymous correspondent in the Chieftain offered a somewhat less poetic account of banquet-goers who “shoveled good grub into the yawning caverns beneath their noses with their knives, thus endangering their heads.”
“Stomachs accustomed to bacon and beans and chili colorado yearned to be filled with the good things prepared by the Denver cooks,” said the Chieftain, “and some of those inured to the attacks of ten cent whisky gaped to receive the generous Jersey champagne which it was hoped would be forthcoming.”
Debate over women’s suffrage
County elections for delegates to the constitutional convention, held in October 1875, had given Republicans a comfortable 25-14 majority over Democrats. Territorial voters would get the final say on the constitution in a referendum later in 1876, but first the convention’s 39 delegates would hash out their disagreements — sometimes, but not always, along party lines — on matters including public education, taxation of church property, the means of selecting the state judiciary and much more.
But the issue that would attract more attention than any other was whether the 38th state’s constitution would be the first to guarantee women the right to vote. The women’s suffrage movement had made a crucial breakthrough in the Wyoming Territory in 1869, when the Legislature of Colorado’s northern neighbor had granted women the franchise and the right to hold public office.
With the constitutional assembly underway, a women’s suffrage convention was held at Denver’s Unity Church, at 17th and California streets, on Jan. 10 and 11, 1876. The timing was no accident: National suffrage groups were determined to seize the opportunity presented by the framing of a new state’s constitution, and the convention was organized by leading suffragists like Margaret W. Campbell of Massachusetts, who had arrived in Denver in December and would remain in Colorado for much of the year to advocate for the cause.
Letters addressed to Campbell in Denver from fellow suffragist Lucy Stone, editor of The Woman’s Journal, are preserved in the Library of Congress. Writing to Campbell ahead of the convention, Stone invoked the commemoration of the nation’s Centennial as she noted the framers of Colorado’s constitution had “the rare opportunity to achieve by peaceful means what our revolutionary fathers fought seven years to obtain.”

“If it was tyranny to tax the colonists a century ago and deny them representation, it is tyranny to do the same to women now,” Stone wrote. “No part of the constitution of Colorado in this Centennial year can be more appropriate, or have more historic credit a hundred years hence, than that part which shall secure for women the right to a voice in making the laws they will be required to obey.”
Some prominent Coloradans still treated such ideas with mocking contempt. A Chieftain correspondent, identified only as “H.,” denounced the “farcical drama” staged by the “disciples of Beecher,” a reference to the prominent family of abolitionists and suffragists.
“Let the devil hide his diminished head, the whole world is running to isms — dogmatism, atheism, pantheism, freeloveism, cannibalism, womansuffrageism, mormonism, spiritualism and a hundred other isms equally heathenish and fallacious,” he wrote.
In many circles, however, such attitudes were going out of fashion. It was more common for the influential men who published Colorado’s territorial newspapers, including William Byers of The Rocky Mountain News, to profess sympathy with the women’s suffrage movement while arguing that such “advanced ideas” were ahead of their time. Echoing arguments made in opposition to civil rights movements throughout American history, Byers urged the suffragists to “bide their time,” casting doubt on the electoral viability of a state constitution that granted women the vote.
“Haste must be made slowly in this matter. It will not do to cause the constitution to carry too heavy a load,” the News argued on Jan. 8. “If weighed down with provisions, the justice and propriety of which are not recognized by the community as a class, but merely by a particular portion of perhaps partial revolutionary tendencies, the constitution will never become a fact.”
In another familiar complaint, an editorial in the Chieftain blamed Campbell and other “chronic agitators imported from the states” for stirring up trouble in the territory.
“The arguments urged in support of the measure may be true to a certain degree, and would doubtless be productive of much good if put in actual practice,” the Chieftain wrote. “But at the same time the impression seems to prevail, that female suffrage can wait a few years, or at least until other and more important questions are determined.”
The moderates got their wish. Colorado’s 1876 constitution granted women a limited right to vote in school board elections, but deferred the broader question of suffrage to the new state’s Legislature and the results of a future voter referendum. After several unsuccessful attempts, Colorado finally became the second state in the nation to adopt women’s suffrage in 1893.

(Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)LINCOLN — The Democratic National Committee has threatened to sue Nebraska over what it describes as a potential agreement with the Justice Department to require election officials to remove any allegedly ineligible voters identified during federal reviews of state voter rolls.
The letter, obtained by the Examiner, set to be sent Friday morning, says the DNC wants to “ensure” the state and the secretary of state are aware of federal constraints on voter registration list maintenance and wants the state not to pursue any “unlawful removals from its official list of eligible voters in elections for federal office.” 
“The DNC sends this letter in the hope that the imminent violations … may still be avoided,” part of the letter to Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen reads. “Nonetheless, the DNC stands ready to issue a formal notice should evidence of ongoing violations come to light. In the event that your office believes further conversations might help avoid a violation of federal law, I would be happy to discuss this matter with you or your staff.”

The letter, from DNC Litigation Director Daniel J. Freeman, outlines how the potential agreement would “violate” federal election law, pointing to the National Voter Registration Act. The DNC argues “a systematic purge” of registered voters would lead to “errors that remove registrants who remain eligible under state law.”
The DNC letter comes after the state secretary of state confirmed in court filings and to the Examiner that he “intends to release the state’s voter file to the federal government on Feb. 12, unless the court orders otherwise.” The court documents were part of a lawsuit by voter advocacy group Common Cause Nebraska, which says it aims to block the sharing of that voter data with the Department of Justice.

The group filed to seek a temporary restraining order on Wednesday over concerns that the court may not issue a final ruling before the secretary releases the data. 
The state agency also confirmed to the Examiner Thursday that it plans to hand over the data on Feb. 12. Federal officials have asked states for names, dates of birth, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers, saying they want the information to ensure voter registration rolls are accurate. 
Late last year, Stateline reported that the Justice Department sent a confidential draft agreement to more than a dozen states. A Justice Department official identified 11 states that had expressed an interest in the agreement during a federal court hearing in December, according to a transcript. Nebraska was one of the 11 that “expressed … a willingness to comply” with the DOJ agreement.  
The agreement, as reported, would hand the federal government a major role in election administration, a responsibility that belongs to the states under the U.S. Constitution. While the DOJ has demanded states’ voter rolls since last summer, the draft agreement offered the most detailed picture yet of how the Trump administration plans to use the information.
Some GOP states have declined or are pushing back against federal efforts to gather the data over privacy concerns. Critics have questioned the safety of letting any administration consolidate such voter data in one place. The federal government has sued two Democratic-run states for the information, the first legal challenge the department has brought against states to obtain the registration records.
Evnen, after getting guidance from Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers, said the state is “fine” with meeting the DOJ request, because Nebraska’s voter rolls are “complete and proper.”
A group of Nebraska lawmakers sent a letter to Evnen asking him to explain his “negotiations” with the federal government over the release of sensitive voter information last week. An agency spokesperson told the Examiner that Evnen has signed no agreement with the DOJ and wasn’t negotiating.

More than eight months after postponing a bill allowing school districts to refuse enrollment to children without legal immigration status, the House sponsor still awaits word on whether it could jeopardize federal funding.
House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland indicated this week he would revive the bill if the money isn’t in danger. 
House Speaker Cameron Sexton also said Thursday he wants to revive the bill, which would give school districts the option to check students to determine whether they have permanent legal documentation, then either block enrollment or charge tuition. 
Sexton said he’s not sure whether the U.S. Department of Education will opine on the matter, but after consulting with the White House over the past year he will roll out a package of immigration bills next week.
“I hope we bring it back in some form or another. We’ll see what that looks like,” Sexton said. “I would assume at some point we will get comfortable with whatever we want to do.”
The Senate measure requiring districts to check students’ immigration status and charge tuition passed in April 2025 on a 19-13 vote, but the House version got hung up on the potential of Tennessee losing more than a billion bucks for enacting a law that violates the constitutional requirement for schools to serve all students.
Breaking anti-discrimination laws could put another gaping hole in the state budget.
In the waning days of the 2025 session, Lamberth had Fiscal Review Executive Director Bojan Savic ask the U.S. Department of Education whether the state was putting the funding in jeopardy. Lamberth held the measure in the House after not receiving immediate word.
Tennessee asks feds whether state funds are jeopardized by immigrant student bill

Asked this week if he plans to revive House Bill 793, Lamberth tiptoed around the question.
“We are awaiting a definitive response from Secretary (Linda) McMahon’s office on whether Tennessee risks losing $1.1 billion in federal education funding. We remain in contact and are hopeful for a resolution,” he said in a statement.
Lamberth, a Portland Republican, said last year he would renew his effort based on the secretary’s response.
Lamberth and Sen. Bo Watson, who sponsored the Senate version, hoped passage would lead to a legal challenge that would reach the Supreme Court so it could revisit a 1982 decision in Plyler v. Doe that established all children have a right to a public school education in the United States, regardless of immigration status.
Even if McMahon says the money isn’t at risk, the bill’s passage isn’t guaranteed.
It narrowly escaped the Senate where opponents, including Republicans, said lawmakers shouldn’t put children in the middle of a fight over immigration. 
Republican Sen. Ferrell Haile of Gallatin used a Bible verse to argue against blaming children for the acts of their parents. 
House members were more worried about losing money, though, and those concerns are likely to surface again in 2026, which is expected to be an even tighter budgeting year because of increased spending and revenue cuts extended in the form of business tax breaks and rebates.
Hallway talk at Cordell Hull, which isn’t quite worth a 25-cent cup of coffee (those don’t exist), says it remains up in the air again as lawmakers prepare to return next week to rattle the cages of Tennesseans.
Some semblance of sanity
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson renewed hope in the nation’s judiciary this week when he sentenced former Rep. Robin Smith to one year of probation rather than six months in prison for her role in a much-ballyhooed fraud case.
The move came after President Donald Trump pardoned former House Speaker Glen Casada and his ex-chief of staff, Cade Cothren, who were set to go to prison for putting together a secretive campaign vendor called Phoenix Solutions to tap into state campaign mailer funds.
Smith hasn’t been able to get a pardon from Trump, which doesn’t seem quite fair. She remains a convicted felon after copping a plea to honest services fraud and testifying against Casada and Cothren while they get off hook, line and sinker.

Sure, Smith might have come up with the idea to go for “low-hanging fruit” with the state’s mailer program. But in this case, it took three to tango. Cothren did the nuts-and-bolts work of setting up Phoenix Solutions in New Mexico while Casada tried to play it cool. Smith and Casada encouraged fellow lawmakers to use Phoenix Solutions to send out taxpayer-funded constituent mailers, and Smith put pressure on state officials to pay up before they got wind of something fishy.
The key factor was keeping Cothren’s name hush-hush after he resigned from his post in 2019 during a racist and sexist texting scandal that engulfed Casada, who also left the speaker’s office after a no-confidence vote by the House Republican Caucus.
In fact, during a four-week trial that nearly left attendees in traction from sitting on federal courtroom pews, attorneys for Casada and Cothren didn’t try to deny the details, claiming mainly that the two were operating a legitimate business and did the work lawmakers wanted.
The jury convicted them on multiple counts of fraud, bribery and money laundering, only to see the pardon waste a month of their lives.
Santa, we’re coming for you
Less than a week after U.S. forces invaded Venezuela and captured its president and first lady, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles started parroting President Trump’s desire to take over mineral-rich Greenland too.
Ogles, who remains under federal investigation for campaign finance violations according to a WTVF report, called America the “dominant predator force” in the Western Hemisphere and said Greenland needs to break its relationship with Denmark and do more to protect America. 
Denmark is a member of NATO and already allows the United States to use Greenland for defense purposes.
Ninety-nine percent of Americans have never been to Greenland or know little about it other than it’s cold as crap there. It’s a self-governed territory of Denmark.
A takeover, though, puts us a little closer to the North Pole and the ultimate goal.
While experts debate the Monroe Doctrine and whether it was legal to extract Nicolas Maduro on cocaine trafficking charges (that’s so 1980s), we’ve decided it’s high time to take back Christmas. Festivus for the rest of us just won’t do. We’re not stopping with Greenland, either. We’re heading straight for Santa’s hometown, the reindeer and the toy shop. 
The charge: failure to deliver the goods. We got nothing but a tinhorn dictator. Oops, nearly forgot to mention Venezuela’s oil supplies.
“I can’t drive 55”
House Speaker Cameron Sexton declined to say Thursday where he was heading the October day a Metro Nashville Police officer stopped his security detail on Briley Parkway for speeding.

“We were just going to another event, like it is, like we do,” Sexton said after a State Building Commission meeting.
Asked why the vehicle driven by a state trooper was doing 85 in a 55, Sexton referred to a statement from his office. That statement, though, only accuses the MNPD officer of being “overzealous” and jeopardizing the safety of Sexton and THP officers and claims there was no violation of traffic laws based on state law. The THP officer flashed his lights at the Metro officer after being flashed to pull over.
In other words, it was business as usual.

But, who will respond? In Idaho, first-responder units are struggling.
Your safety net is “EMS” (Emergency Medical Services). You know the sirens, flashing lights, ambulances, helicopters, firetrucks, and dedicated emergency-care responders. Local first responders serve everyone in crisis, not just their local community. Wherever you’re traveling in Idaho, a network of first responders helps protect you.
In this rural Idaho county, paramedics are being trained to help with mental health crises

Idaho faces daunting challenges providing rural health care, including EMS. Stanley, Idaho, is gateway to some of America’s spectacular wildlands and rivers. How can a town of 60-some people be responsible for providing health care for over a million visitors? Stanley made medical history by helping create the nurse practitioner profession and rural EMS.
In Stanley in 1971, we offered one of the first EMT trainings and established Idaho’s first 9-1-1 system. U.S. Forest Service and Idaho Fish and Game staff joined local townspeople to volunteer as EMTs to help staff the Stanley Ambulance — some have volunteered to take emergency call for decades.
One reason rural EMS units are in trouble is because ambulances cost $120,000-$300,000. Our first Stanley ambulance, costing $300 in 1972, was military surplus with holes in the floorboards, fumes, and an unreliable electrical system. One night, we lost our lights in subzero temperatures transporting a heart-attack patient over 8,900-foot Galena Summit. U.S. Sen. Frank Church highlighted the Stanley Ambulance and nurse practitioner when asking Senate colleagues to support rural health care. Today, elected officials accept they have responsibilities in supporting EMS.
Rural communities don’t have the tax base and depend on volunteers. Yet, fewer younger people are stepping up to volunteer. This isn’t a uniquely Idaho problem: For years, he has saved lives in Rural America. Who will take his place? (New York Times).
Idahoans should be proud of its leadership in creating solutions for rural health care. Legislators, notably physician/legislator Dr. John Edwards of Council, led efforts to bring health care to rural communities: licensing nurse practitioners and training rural doctors through WWAMI and the University of Utah.
Rep. Terry Crapo, the older brother of U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, was Idaho’s House Majority Leader from 1968-1972, and led bipartisan efforts to support EMS. His work was foundational to establishing the Idaho Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (Idaho EMS) in 1973.
Today, Idaho EMS is a statewide system responsible for providing immediate pre-hospital medical care and transporting the sick and injured. Wherever you are in Idaho, your emergency care is coordinated through “StateComm,” Idaho EMS State Communications Center, located in Meridian.
In 2025 in the Idaho Capitol Rotunda, while we released our new book, “Moving Mountains: creating the Nurse Practitioner and Rural EMS,” elsewhere in the building legislators were discussing making EMS an “essential service.” This would be a critical step to committing state resources to supporting struggling first-responder units. Instead, the Legislature voted to move Idaho EMS from the Department of Health and Welfare to the Idaho Military Division (IMD).
We lived through the health care revolution creating EMS and were part of that revolution. Today, a half-century later, we see our state’s emergency safety nets unravelling.
The key point is that Idahoans’ health care depends on our elected leaders. Idahoans need enduring solutions to our health care crisis hitting first and worst in our rural communities.
We don’t expect legislators to read our book and learn from the Stanley Ambulance’s volunteer EMTs. But we do ask that our elected leaders take action to protect their voting constituents who, someday, will call 9-1-1 and need to know that someone, somewhere, will respond to their pleas and screams for help.

It may contain errors or inaccuracies.
The Democratic National Committee on Friday sent a letter to Secretary of State Michael Watson’s office warning that the state is on the verge of violating federal voter-protection laws over a potential agreement to share Mississippi voter files with the Department of Justice. 
The state agency, according to the DNC, is about to send the federal government Mississippi’s full voter file, something President Donald Trump’s administration has pressured states to hand over, so the Justice Department can crack down on alleged ineligible voters. 
Ken Martin, the chairman of the DNC, said in a statement that the Trump administration wants to force states such as Mississippi to hand over voter files so it can create a national database with sensitive personal information such as driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers, and party affiliation. 
“The DNC won’t stand idly by as the Trump DOJ tries to get access to Mississippi voters’ sensitive information and put eligible voters at risk of being wrongfully purged from Mississippi’s voter rolls, which is why we are calling on the Mississippi Secretary of State to stand up for Mississippians and reject the Trump administration’s illegal agreement,” Martin said.
Watson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The DNC fears that this agreement could result in eligible voters being removed from registration lists, particularly near elections, and put their personal information at risk. 
To address these concerns, the DNC has requested records from Watson’s office about the proposed agreement and any communications with the Justice Department about voter-list maintenance. 
Trump officials, in 2017, made a similar request for voter records from Mississippi. Then-Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, a Republican who is currently lieutenant governor, responded to the request by telling them they can “go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from.”

(Photo by Getty Images)Virginia’s employers say the lack of affordable, high-quality child care is hurting businesses, with 88% of survey respondents reporting employee lateness or absences, and 65% reporting reduced work hours, according to results published last month by the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, the Richmond Fed and the Virginia Chamber Foundation. 
The findings come as state lawmakers prepare to address child care and other issues facing the commonwealth during the 2026 General Assembly Session. VPM reported in October that nearly 14,000 children were on a wait list for the Child Care Subsidy Program alone.
Kathy Glazer, president of the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, said the survey’s findings are a clear indicator of risks to Virginia’s economy and workforce. Results indicate that the highest disruption is to hospitality, food service, retail, trade and transportation and health care industries.
“When child care is unaffordable or unavailable, it constrains our workforce, weakens productivity, and slows economic growth,” Glazer said in a statement. “Addressing child care access and affordability must remain a top priority if Virginia wants to stay competitive and continue attracting working families and top-tier businesses to our state.”
The survey gathered responses from 308 Virginia employers. More than eight in ten say that child care challenges hinder hiring and retention. Additionally, 41% report that employees turn down job offers or promotions because of child care concerns.
Other findings include families facing a severe shortage of available, affordable child care options, with 65% of employers saying their workers struggle to find open slots and more than 85% citing cost as a major burden.
Employers said they want to help, but cost is a barrier, with fewer than 20% of businesses currently offering support. 
Results indicated that many employers are open to offering solutions like child care referral services, cost-sharing models, employer-sponsored care and child care vouchers or subsidies.
“The lack of cost-effective childcare options in Virginia is a barrier to workforce participation, and employers want to be part of the solution,” said Keith Martin, interim president and CEO of the Virginia Chamber Foundation. “This was a consistent theme we heard from employers statewide while developing Blueprint Virginia 2035, which makes clear that strengthening our workforce requires solutions which include prioritizing state funding for quality, affordable childcare through efforts like the proposed Employee Child Care Assistance Pilot Program.”
Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, is carrying the Employee Child Care Assistance Program proposal, otherwise known as Senate Bill 3. The program would allow employers to receive state matching funds to help pay for an employee’s child care. 
Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, filed the companion measure, House Bill 18.
Also in the Senate, Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton,  filed Senate Bill 20, expanding Virginia’s Child Care Subsidy Program so more families can qualify based on income. Under the proposal, the Virginia Department of Education would be directed to develop and implement a phased reduction model for the Child Care Subsidy Program that gradually reduces the amount of help a family receives as they start to earn more. 
The bills closely align with Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger’s plan to strengthen child care in the commonwealth. Her plan also seeks to help more Virginians enter the early child care sector and improve worker retention.
Lawmakers are likely to file additional bills and budget proposals to address child care this month.
The General Assembly Session begins on Wednesday in Richmond and will run until at least mid-March.

While the Virginia Freedom of Information Act presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.
In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.
Reducing SNAP error rates
New requirements in the latest federal funding package mandate that states have to significantly reduce the error rate of calculating and distributing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits in order to still be able to receive the funding. The Virginia Mercury filed FOIA requests with the Department of Social Services and the Department of Health to glean information on how the state is working to prevent under or over paying recipients as gubernatorial administrations prepare to pass the torch.
Public records revealed the state is considering a $1.7 million contract with a company called KPMG that offers tax, audit, and advisory services. The company would help local social services offices improve payment accuracy.
Records also showed a group called the Virginia League for Social Service Executives expressed concerns about whether smaller offices would be able to handle the additional administrative burden. Out-going Gov. Glenn Youngkin earmarked $2.4 million in his budget that would go towards hiring 14 people to assist in those endeavors. It is not certain that Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger will keep that money in the final budget.
Lack of state funding could raise Richmond water bills following 2025 water crisis
One year after the city of Richmond and surrounding counties went days without water following a winter storm that knocked out power and triggered a series of failures at the water treatment plant, the possibility of residents’ water bills rising looms on the horizon.
Following the crisis, the city made a number of changes, including creating a 10-year plan for water system upgrades. That plan cost totals $1.4 billion over a decade to improve the treatment plant, pumps, pipes and other projects across the city.
Mayor Danny Avula sent a request to Gov. Glenn Youngkin for $80 million in the state budget to help offset some of the cost that will ultimately be placed on water customers to cover the price of those projects. But Youngkin did not include the request in his final budget proposal. 
The Richmonder requested documents that show just how much bills will be impacted if the state funds remain out of the budget. The mayor’s office rejected the request, citing them as mayoral working papers. Avula said in a press conference that conversations with the incoming administration are still occurring in hopes of the funding making it into the final version of the budget.



				The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings.			


Potential racism and retaliation at Red Onion State Prison
Allegations of racism and abuse were raised by inmates at Red Onion State Prison in 2024 which launched an investigation by the Office of the Inspector General into claims of physical and sexual abuse, inhumane treament, and poor living conditions.
In records obtained by the Virginia Mercury this week, most of the claims have been found “unsubstantiated” by the Correction’s Ombudsman. However, the allegations of racism and retaliation were deemed “inconclusive” which neither proves or disproves their occurrence at the facility.
Office of the State Inspector General representatives visited the prison to conduct interviews about the claims made by inmates who had reportedly burned themselves in protest of the living conditions. Some of the correctional officers interviewed suggested they believed the inmates who burned themselves were attempting to get transferred to facilities closer to family, OSIG’s investigation relayed.
Inmates, their families, and activists have previously accused the prison of over-using solitary confinement. A legislative report in 2024 found that at least one facility in the state was not allowing inmates time out of their cells for the mandated amount of time when in solitary confinement, which in Virginia is referred to as restorative housing.
The new report by OSIG found that Red Onion was not in violation of the rules around the confinement and some inmates had refused the out of cell time. Investigators recommended that the prison make complaints forms more accessible to prisoners and offer additional education and health resources. 
Efforts to reduce FOIA costs makes return to General Assembly
For years, Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, has filed legislation that looks to limit what public agencies can charge for public records and clarifies how agencies can seek court relief when faced with large or complicated requests.
The Virginia Mercury reported earlier this week that Senate Bill 56 would limit agencies to charging the median hourly rate of pay of their employees — or the actual hourly rate of the employee performing the work, whichever is lower — when calculating labor costs for producing public records.
Those in support of the bill believe it will prevent agencies from assigning high-wage workers from processing the requests, which would curb production costs. The bill does carve out some exceptions to the rule.
Roem, a former journalist, has made public records reform a key priority for her term. She said the goal of her latest bill is to make  records more accessible to the public so they may be used as a tool to gain critical information about government agencies.

And I’m absolutely giggly about it.
This was the expected culmination, after all, of a work history that began when I logged shifts at fast-food joints in Washington as a teenager – dodging both grease and occasionally rude customers.  
I know, intellectually, that I derive all sorts of benefits from my federal tax dollars: Military protection. Interstate highways. Health care, which I gained directly after starting Medicare at age 65. (I still fork over monthly premiums, but thank goodness it’s available for senior citizens. Attacks on Obamacare for younger Americans are petty and threaten lives.)
Now, though, the money set aside for Social Security was finally coming back to me. I’ve wagered that I should start collecting those benefits now.
Happy birthday, Social Security. Unless Congress acts, full benefits end in 7 years.

The pending insolvency of the system is a looming threat. By 2032, Social Security won’t be able to pay out full retirement benefits without significant changes. Among the proposals is ending the cap on earnings subject to the Social Security tax, which currently is $184,500.
Of course, the program is popular among seniors, who are a reliable voting bloc. Do-nothing lawmakers won’t stay in Congress much longer if they don’t act.
This Baby Boomer could’ve waited until turning almost 67 to gain full retirement, and thus more cash monthly. But I was chastened by the fact the Black men in my immediate family didn’t make it past 70, and that life expectancy among African-American men is lower than other subgroups.
So today, I’m relishing the GIF a friend sent me after I told him the news about starting my benefits now. The fictional character Carlton Banks breaks out in his eponymous dance.
I don’t care how corny it is. I love getting paid, for the taxes I’ve already contributed over decades.

A 2022 report by the Greater Ohio Policy Center said that the state labor force declined by 91,000 between 2000 and 2020 — a pretty good indicator that a weak job market has been to blame for the Buckeye State’s slowing population growth.
In a survey conducted by Scioto Analysis in late December, economists agreed jobs and growth are linked. Asked whether they agreed that “Employment opportunities are a major contributor to Ohio’s current population-growth trend,” 20 agreed, one disagreed and two were uncertain.
In the comment section of the survey, Kathryn Wilson of Kent State University said the places in Ohio where population is growing confirm the relationship between economic opportunity and population trends. Unlike most other counties, Franklin and five others in Central Ohio are expected to grow in population, some robustly.
“Employment opportunities are a contributor on both sides of the ledger,” Wilson wrote. “Areas around Columbus that are seeing growth in population are also seeing job growth. Other areas of the state with less job growth are seeing a net migration out of people.”
Andy Welki of John Carroll University put it more succinctly.

“Self interest drives individual choices,” he wrote. “People follow economic opportunities.”
The sour news about Ohio’s growth comes after the state’s Republican leadership has spent billions on promises that those expenditures would create jobs. 
In 2011, then-Gov. John Kasich led the effort to create JobsOhio, which now has a large, highly paid staff. The organization claims it is a private company, but it was created by the legislature.
Without competitive bidding, it was allowed to lease the state liquor franchise for less than it was worth. And a year ago, a board under now-Gov. Mike DeWine extended the lease to 2053 — without requiring JobsOhio to pay taxpayers any additional money.
Taxpayers have now foregone well over $1 billion that they would have received from the liquor franchise. JobsOhio has awarded that money in business incentives, but it has struggled to show that it’s created any jobs.
DeWine also has provided billions to a Central Ohio chipmaker for a project that may never become reality. In addition, his administration has provided incentives to low-employment data centers that one analysis said cost taxpayers $1 million for each job created.
In addition to all that, Kasich in 2013 signed into law a tax break for limited liability companies that is heavily tilted in favor of wealthy Ohioans. Again, the promise was that it would create jobs.
That tax break costs Ohioans about $1 billion a year. But Ohio now has the nation’s sixth-highest unemployment. So that, too, appears to not be working.",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220909__R611245-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-09 05:11:45.557728

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/Maine Morning Star)With food insecurity on the rise, Maine lawmakers are scrambling to ensure they have a sense of how many people are going hungry after the federal government’s recent cancellation of a key food insecurity survey.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Household Food Security Report, started under former President Bill Clinton, measured rates of food insecurity across the country every year for three decades. Food banks, state departments and nonprofits used the results of that survey to inform their efforts to address hunger. 
Last September, the department announced it was ending the survey, which experts said at the time would mean that when it comes to hunger, they would be flying blind.
On the first day of the legislative session, Rep. Bill Pluecker (I-Warren) introduced LD 2040, which would institute a statewide survey to collect information from households to help guide food assistance programs. Maine has not collected this kind of state-level data before, and this survey would be an opportunity to gain detailed data about what communities and demographics are most acutely impacted by food insecurity, Pluecker said.
“The result would be to understand our state’s food insecurity more accurately so that we can make better decisions,” he said at a public hearing before the Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Committee on Wednesday. 
“It’s about accountability to Maine people who go to bed hungry, and responsibility to taxpayers funding anti-hunger programs,” Pluecker said. “We owe both groups clear answers about whether our efforts at ending hunger are working.”
The proposal is for a limited pilot study ending in 2028, unless reauthorized. The study will mostly rely on private philanthropy, except for a $500 state contribution.
The bill was backed by the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future as well as several anti-hunger organizations, including Good Shepherd Food Bank, Full Plates Full Potential, and Maine Children’s Alliance. No one during the hearing spoke against it.
Maine experts say feds ‘hiding the evidence’ by eliminating key food security survey

Over the last decade, federal data has helped guide the state’s planning in its roadmap to end hunger by 2030, said Anna Korsen, deputy director of Full Plates Full Potential and co-chair of the advisory committee charged with implementing the roadmap.  
In her testimony before the committee, Korsen said that access to reliable data allowed advocates to make major strides in reducing hunger in Maine. COVID-era programs to address hunger, including expanded nutrition benefits, free school meals for all, and the Child Tax Credit expansion resulted in “rapid and dramatic declines” in food insecurity for families and children, she said. 
But Maine still has the highest rate of childhood food insecurity in New England, with one in five kids unsure of where their next meal will come from. In rural areas like Aroostook County, that number jumps to one in four children.
Based on the latest USDA survey data released a week ago — the last release due to the program’s cancellation — overall hunger is increasing across the country and in Maine. Nationally, 13.7% of households were food insecure in 2024. While the report did not break down state-level data, between 2022 and 2024, an average of 12.9% of Maine households lacked adequate access to food, increasing from 9.5% between 2019 and 2021.
Alex Carter, senior policy advocate at Maine Equal Justice, said with the survey cancelled, it will be harder to track trends and evaluate the impacts of policy, including the “likely increases in food insecurity that will result from the expected loss and changes to SNAP benefits.”

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThere will be some fresh faces under the Gold Dome when lawmakers reconvene next week for the 2026 legislative session. 
That’s thanks to a series of off-year special elections held to replace state lawmakers who have died, resigned or been appointed to other political offices. At least three representatives will make their House debut, and another three legislators will join the Senate to finish out the remainder of their predecessor’s two-year legislative term.
There are also more special elections to come in the new year, after two lawmakers recently announced they were leaving the state Legislature. Former Rep. Karen Bennett, a Stone Mountain Democrat, resigned her seat days before she was charged with fraudulently receiving nearly $14,000 in unemployment benefits. Former Rep. Lynn Heffner, an Augusta Democrat, also resigned Monday citing damage to her home from Hurricane Helene and the state law requiring representatives to live in the districts they represent. Details about the elections to replace the two representatives have not yet been announced.
Here’s a look at the newcomers.
House District 23
The newest lawmaker in a Cherokee County-based district will be Republican Bill Fincher, who defeated Democrat Scott Sanders during a runoff election Tuesday, maintaining the GOP’s hold over the district.
Fincher, a former district attorney who now owns an RV park, received over 70% of the vote according to unofficial results from the secretary of state’s office. He will replace Republican state Rep. Mandi Ballinger of Canton, who died in October after a long battle with cancer.
In an interview, Fincher told the Georgia Recorder that he was “absolutely humbled” by the support of the voters in his district. His top priorities will be capping property taxes, reducing traffic around metro Atlanta and lowering the cost of insurance premiums.
The district, which includes Canton, part of northern Holly Springs and the surrounding unincorporated areas, heavily favors a Republican. 
House District 106

Democrat Muhammad Akbar Ali, a graphic designer and former first vice chair of the Gwinnett County Democratic Party, is headed to the Gold Dome after defeating fellow Democrat Marqus Cole during a runoff election for a southwest Gwinnett County state House seat.
Ali focused his campaign on issues like lowering the cost of living, supporting public schools and protecting the rights of immigrants and LGBTQ Georgians. He received a slew of endorsements from key figures in Georgia’s Democratic establishment, including House Minority Caucus Whip Sam Park, a Lawrenceville Democrat, and former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes.
The district’s previous representative, Snellville Democrat Shelly Hutchinson, stepped down from the state Legislature earlier to care for a family member. She later endorsed Ali.
At 21, Ali is set to become the youngest state legislator currently serving in Georgia, stealing the title of youngest lawmaker from Democratic Rep. Bryce Berry of Atlanta.

In a stunning upset, Democrats flipped a northeast Georgia House seat, gaining control of an Athens-area district for the first time since 2019.
Eric Gisler, a tech executive and small business owner, will replace former state Rep. Marcus Wiedower, a Watkinsville Republican who abruptly resigned from his seat to focus on his work as vice president of external affairs at the real estate firm Hillpointe. 
The district, which covers parts of Clarke and Oconee counties, has historically leaned conservative. Wiedower won his last election with 61% of the vote.
In an interview, Gisler credited his campaign’s success to a strong ground game, as well as his focus on issues like health care access and the rising cost of living, which he said likely appealed to some Republican voters.
Senate District 18
Voters have yet to select a replacement for state Sen. John F. Kennedy, a Macon Republican who resigned in December to focus on his campaign for lieutenant governor.
The district encompasses Crawford, Monroe, Peach and Upson counties, as well as part of Bibb and Houston counties. Six candidates — five Republicans and one Democrat — have qualified for the seat. They include former state Rep. Lauren Daniel, former Forsyth Mayor Eric Wilson and former Fort Valley Mayor Pro Tem LeMario Brown.
The election will be held on Jan. 20, roughly a week after the start of the 2026 legislative session, and early voting for the race will begin on Dec. 29. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a runoff election will be held on Feb. 17.
Senate District 21

Republican state Sen. Jason Dickerson, the president of a private investment firm, will replace former Alpharetta Republican state Sen. Brandon Beach after securing a victory in what was perhaps the most contentious legislative special election of 2025.
Beach, who had represented the district since 2013, resigned from the Senate after President Donald Trump appointed him to serve as the 46th U.S. Treasurer. The district, which includes parts of Fulton and Cherokee counties, is predominantly Republican, with Beach receiving upwards of 70% of the vote against a Democratic challenger in 2024.
But Democrats rejoiced after Debra Shigley, an Alpharetta mom, attorney and small business owner, racked up nearly 40% of the vote in a seven-way special election. Her campaign also received door-knocking help from high-profile Democrats like Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin and U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff.
The district’s Republican base quickly coalesced around Dickerson in the runoff, and he ultimately won the seat with over 60% of the vote, though Democrats cheered the gains made in the conservative district. 
Senate District 35
Democrat Jaha Howard, a dentist and former Cobb County School Board member, is headed to the state Capitol, representing a metro Atlanta district that includes portions of Cobb and Fulton counties.
Howard narrowly defeated former Democratic state Rep. Roger Bruce, who retired from the state Legislature in 2024, during a special election runoff on Dec. 16. He will replace former state Sen. Jason Esteves, an Atlanta Democrat who resigned from the state Senate in September to focus on his campaign for governor.
According to his campaign website, Howard plans to prioritize supporting small businesses, reducing barriers to health care access and increasing literacy rates.
This is not Howard’s first foray into politics; he has also been a candidate for state school superintendent and ran for a seat on the Cobb County commission last year. During a previous bid for state Senate in 2017, however, he came under fire for sexist and homophobic comments he posted on social media between 2011 and 2014. Last year, he told the Georgia Recorder he has worked to gain voters’ trust in his commitment to LGBTQ and women’s rights.
He also received an endorsement from state Sen. RaShaun Kemp, one of the two openly gay lawmakers in the chamber.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0221.jpeg,,,2026-01-09 05:11:45.557728

(Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)VANDALIA, Mo. — Kathy Briggs slipped her arms through the thick straps of a brand-new baby carrier, tugging it over her beige shirt as two other women stood beside her, tightening buckles and adjusting the padded waistband.
The carrier was still stiff from its packaging, and Briggs shifted her feet as one of the women gently lifted then-6-month-old Melody into the front pouch.
Melody’s gray-blue eyes tracked the women’s hands, and her wispy blond hair — gathered into a tiny pink bow — bobbed slightly with the movement. She blinked up at the adults.
“Put your foot in there,” one of the women said, guiding Melody’s leg through the opening.
“She’s just a little chunk,” the other woman said.
Briggs’ eyes widened, and she squealed, half laughing, as Melody settled against her chest. Across the room, a few women looked up from boxes of newly arrived donations — tiny onesies and hip carriers still wrapped in plastic.
Someone let out a soft “aww.” Briggs, 29, bounced on her heels, testing the weight, her palms hovering protectively near Melody’s back.
For a moment, the room felt like any early childhood nursery: adult chatter and baby babbles, women comparing baby gear and swapping soothing techniques.
Yet the jangling of keys and the watchful eyes of uniformed officers were a reminder that this colorful corner of the world existed not in a day care, but inside a women’s prison in rural Missouri.
Programs like this one allow babies inside prisons — a rare and controversial approach that forces states to confront how punishment, public safety and early childhood development collide. As more women enter state prisons while pregnant, lawmakers and corrections officials are expanding prison nursery programs, betting that keeping mothers and infants together can reduce trauma and recidivism — even as critics question whether any prison can ever be an appropriate place for a child.

Missouri’s program, which opened last February at the Women’s Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center, is the ninth nursery program currently operating inside of a prison in the country. The program was adopted into state law in 2022.
Each year, thousands of pregnant offenders are admitted to local jails and state prisons — most for nonviolent crimes. In 2023, the latest year with data available, about 2% of women who were admitted to state prisons were pregnant, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The number of incarcerated women has climbed sharply over the past several decades, making them one of the fastest-growing segments of the prison population. Some experts say the trend has forced states to confront a basic reality: Most correctional facilities were never designed to accommodate new mothers.


“Routine aspects of prison operations just really don’t consider the distinct needs of women, and particularly not of pregnant women,” said Alycia Welch, the associate director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. Welch researches carceral conditions and oversight with a focus on women’s experiences.
Federal reports and research have found that pregnant inmates face systemic barriers to timely care — from guards controlling access to medical treatment to logistical delays and medical fees. Shackling during pregnancy and childbirth persists despite restrictions in at least 42 states.
The programs benefit relatively few women, and some criminal justice advocates say they reinforce the notion that incarceration — rather than community-based drug treatment or diversion — should remain the default response for pregnant women in the criminal legal system.
Some research suggests the nurseries can strengthen early bonding, improve maternal mental health and support the transition from incarceration back into the community after new mothers have time to parent their infants in a structured, supportive environment.
“This community just lifts us up,” Briggs said.
Inside Missouri’s nursery program
The room Kaley McDowell shares with her infant daughter, Kimber, is arranged for two mothers and two babies — twin beds on each wall, a pair of cribs nearby and space left open for feeding, rocking and play.
McDowell’s rocking chair sits in the corner, draped with a warm, butter yellow blanket. She settled into the rocker with Kimber in her arms just as a soft, classical melody drifted from one of the crib-soother toys. Kimber curled tightly against her chest; her cheek pressed into her mother’s shirt.
“She thinks she’s gonna eat now,” McDowell joked, shifting her baby upright on her thighs as the two rocked slowly back and forth. She then set Kimber down so the child could try standing.
Kimber steadied herself, then reached down toward her tiny toes as if surprised to find them there.
Kaley McDowell helps her daughter Kimber stand while sitting in a rocking chair in their room — their favorite spot in the nursery unit. Each mom-and-baby room can accommodate up to two mothers, with a total capacity of 14 mom and baby pairs. (Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)
McDowell, 34, is a girl mom through and through. All four of her daughters — ages 13, 9, 2 and now-7-month-old Kimber — have “K” names, a small bit of continuity she’s proud of.
Inside the nursery unit, she’s the experienced mom, the one other women seek out for advice.
McDowell isn’t set for release until August, which means Kimber will leave the nursery around 15 months old. In the meantime, McDowell is taking classes to get her GED diploma and hopes to earn her license as a certified nurse assistant.
Missouri’s prison nursery program allows eligible women to live with their newborns for up to 18 months. Women must have no more than 18 months remaining on their sentence at the time of delivery, and those who have committed violent sexual offenses or crimes against children cannot participate.
Prison officials also review disciplinary history, physical and mental health, and engagement in programming before approving someone for one of the unit’s seven bedrooms, which collectively can house up to 14 babies at a time.

About two dozen infants are expected to cycle through the nursery each year, and staff anticipate that number will climb — a sign of growing demand for the program.
“I have watched moms transform their lives,” said Kim Perkins, the nursery’s program manager.
Across the day, the nursery fills with the kinds of small, steady interactions that shape early childhood: Mothers reading baby books, caregivers rocking fussy infants, babies sprawled across play mats surrounded by stuffed animals. Correctional officers and nursery staff also often help, whether by holding a wiggly baby or fetching supplies.
“They like to come and steal the babies when they can,” McDowell said. “They’re like our in-house grandmas.”
The unit’s officers also are trained to expect round-the-clock movement, and the team includes male officers, so infants grow accustomed to hearing different voices.

“It’s going to be a good thing for these women,” said Lisa Unger, one of the unit’s correctional officers. While she was initially apprehensive about the program, she said she has watched women genuinely change over time with the support they receive.
When mothers cook group meals — something that happens at least once a week — the unit feels briefly like a crowded family kitchen, with women passing plates, joking and handing off infants so someone else can finish stirring a pot.
Movement across the unit is tightly restricted, though. Babies are not allowed upstairs to the sleeping and living quarters of caregivers — incarcerated women trained for the role — and mothers go there only to “shop” in the storage room stocked with donated clothing. When the weather is nice and staffing allows, the mothers can take their babies outside to the play area. The babies do not enter other parts of the prison.
Turning point
For much of her life, Kathy Briggs did not imagine a future that included her. She was first incarcerated at 15, and has now been in and out of incarceration three times.
Addiction shaped nearly every corner of her adulthood — where she slept and whom she trusted. Some nights were spent in drug houses, others on the street. She lost two pregnancies.
New report urges more individualized justice system responses for women

At her lowest point, Briggs tattooed “DNR” — which stands for “do not resuscitate” — above her left eye.
When Briggs learned she was expecting again — this time while in county jail awaiting adjudication — she doubted her ability to stay sober, to find housing, to understand motherhood at all. When she learned she was carrying twins, her panic deepened.
Who would take them? Who would trust her with them?
The turning point came with a sentence delivered calmly from the bench. Facing drug possession and firearm-related charges, Briggs expected another familiar outcome and that she’d be released shortly. Instead, the judge told her she would go to prison — and have her babies there.
Briggs protested — babies did not belong in prison. But the judge insisted. More importantly, he told her he believed in her. It was the first time, she said, anyone in a position of authority had made her feel like she could overcome her past.
She arrived at prison seven months pregnant.
At first, she had considered adoption, but then she learned she was carrying two babies — whom she has nicknamed “Little Lyric” and “Mighty Melody,” inspired by the music that always made her feel free.

The infants’ play space is awash in color: Rugs patterned with swirling motifs and florals; shelves crammed with books, dolls and stacking toys; rocking chairs with tufted pillows. A baby swing clicks rhythmically in one corner. Near a window overlooking an outdoor play area, a potted plant soaks up the morning sun.
Inside the nursery, Briggs’ daughters, whom she calls her “best friends,” thrive. Their father also is incarcerated, and the nursery staff are working to make sure he can receive regular updates and photos of the girls.
“Some of us didn’t grow up with good families or a lot of love,” Briggs said. “Here, they’re teaching us how to grow with our babies, and that is such a beautiful thing.”
Some of the program’s caregivers say the strength of the unit comes from the fact that no one is raising a baby in isolation — and that some caregivers bring their own lived experience as mothers to guide the others.
One morning, caregiver Tara Carroll sat on the floor, sorting a pile of donated baby clothes while several women gathered around her — some seated at a nearby table, others standing and talking among themselves.

She organized the outfits by size, slipping the clothes onto tiny colorful hangers. As she logged each item, a few of the women began matching tops and bottoms, holding them up for one another to weigh in.
“This one will fit her, and it’s got cute little pants and a snowflake,” Carroll told one mother.
“That’s cuuuuuute,” another mom chimed in.
Carroll, 34, has been incarcerated for several years on property-related charges, and she remembers what it was like before the nursery existed.
In 2022, she delivered her now-3-year-old daughter, Dillon Rayee, at a nearby hospital and spent 48 hours with her before her husband took their newborn home.
“It was heart-wrenching, and I promised my daughter that I would do everything that I could to come home to her,” Carroll said. She hopes to use her experience in the prison to become a doula.
Until the nursery opened, her birth experience was the norm: a day or two with a newborn, then the baby went into foster care or with family and the mother returned to her cell. For Carroll, helping the women in the unit now — guiding them through feedings, showing them how to swaddle, offering advice during long nights — feels like a way of honoring her promise to her daughter.
Policies across the states
Across the country, fewer than a dozen states operate nursery programs that allow incarcerated mothers to live with their newborns.
New York operates the nation’s oldest prison nursery, which opened in the early 1900s at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility. The program allows up to 25 incarcerated mothers to live with their infants — typically until age 1 — under a system governed by state law and administered by a nonprofit provider, Hour Children.
Newer programs — in Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, Ohio, Washington state and West Virginia — vary widely in size, eligibility and funding. Many rely heavily on nonprofit partners or donations to cover essentials such as diapers, cribs and parenting classes.
Incarcerated women often don’t have enough period products

Nebraska’s program, which launched in 1994, allows mothers to participate if their parole eligibility date or release date falls within 18 months of their child’s birth.
Rosita Vizcarra, 29, said the program has been a “blessing,” giving her the chance to bond with her now-9-month-old son, Liam, while also learning how to be a better parent to her two older daughters.
“He’s crawling and starting to stand,” Vizcarra wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform. “He’s such a happy baby.”
Miranda Messenger, 37, told Stateline in a message that the program has given her what she and her now 4-month-old son, Kyle, need to succeed and stay connected to her support system while separated from her three older children.
“It’s gonna help Miranda tenfold,” said Shannon Fune, Kyle’s father, who has been able to visit the pair a few times. “I was a little bit jealous or disappointed that I wasn’t gonna be there.”
A 2018 study of Nebraska’s program found participation was associated with a 28% reduction in recidivism within three years of the initial offense and a 39% reduction in returns to prison custody within 20 years over the 20-year period of the study. The author, Joseph R. Carlson, a former professor at the University of Nebraska, also estimated that the program saved the state more than $6 million between 1994 and 2012.
A handful of states — Kansas, North Dakota, Virginia and Wisconsin — are considering or expanding nursery programs. Idaho and Wyoming explored nursery plans in recent years, but abandoned them due to space, budget and staffing issues, according to state corrections officials.
Many other states offer other programs they say benefit incarcerated mothers, such as doula programs during pregnancy or during labor and delivery, extended visitation for young children or mother-child facilities based in communities rather than a prison.
Although interest in programs for pregnant and postpartum women in the criminal legal system has grown, experts across the country say there is still not enough research to know how well these programs work — and even basic data on the number and experiences or outcomes of incarcerated pregnant people remains limited.
“It’s, for me, really unfortunate that we are doing this without evidence to inform the policies we’re putting in place,” said Rebecca Shlafer, a child psychologist and associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. Shlafer also evaluated the implementation of Minnesota’s 2021 Healthy Start Act, which allows pregnant and postpartum women to participate in community-based alternatives.
‘A real patchwork’
It’s hard to know exactly how many pregnant people enter jails and prisons each year. The federal government does not require correctional systems to track pregnancy data, and reporting varies widely by state.
By the end of 2023, 305 pregnant women were housed in state prisons, according to the latest federal data, which was released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in April. At least 75 women lived in prison nurseries or residential programs with their infants in 2023.










Some of us didn't grow up with good families or a lot of love.


– Kathy Briggs, an incarcerated mother in Missouri


A 2019 study of incarcerated pregnant women — drawing from both state and federal facilities — estimated roughly 58,000 admissions to prisons and jails between 2016 and 2017. The study, conducted by the Advocacy and Research on Reproductive Wellness of Incarcerated People group and published in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Public Health, is considered the first national investigation into pregnancy frequency and outcomes in prisons.
There are no federal standards for prison nursery programs, and each state sets its own rules — who qualifies, how long mothers can stay, what staffing and safety protocols look like and what reentry support is offered.
US families shoulder nearly $350B in annual costs tied to incarceration, report finds

Studies of long-running programs in Nebraska and New York found that mothers who participated were less likely to return to prison than similar women who weren’t admitted. But those results, some experts say, may be shaped by the programs’ strict eligibility rules: Nurseries typically accept people with lower-level offenses and short sentences.
A study published in April in the peer-reviewed Women & Criminal Justice journal found that the existence of prison nursery programs caused stress and anxiety for those who weren’t eligible after giving birth, leaving them feeling like unfit mothers, and diverted resources from other ways to help incarcerated moms maintain bonds with their babies.
“We can think outside the prison walls for how to keep moms and babies together in ways that still maintain safety and accountability,” said Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, a medical anthropologist and an obstetrician-gynecologist at Johns Hopkins University. Sufrin also leads the Advocacy and Research on Reproductive Wellness of Incarcerated People group.
Critics of prison nurseries argue that the correctional environment is fundamentally ill-suited to meet the health, developmental and emotional needs of pregnant or postpartum women and their infants.
Prisons are usually not staffed with maternal health experts or pediatricians, and medical care is often inconsistent. The environment itself limits babies’ movement and ability to form relationships with other family members. The children can’t go outdoors every day.
Financial stability also is a major concern. Some of the existing prison nursery programs nationwide primarily depend on donations or nonprofit support instead of consistent state funding. Critics argue that this makes nurseries a fragile, resource-heavy solution that helps only a small number of women while reinforcing the broader system of incarceration rather than providing a reliable, scalable alternative.
“It’s a real patchwork out there, and every state is different, but again, just not ideal tohave women and babies in these settings,” said Erin McClain, a research associate and the assistant director of the University of North Carolina Collaborative for Maternal and Infant Health, a research center focusing on high-risk pregnancies and infants.

A path forward
Briggs is set to leave Missouri’s Women’s Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center for a halfway house, again with her babies, later this month. She has thought extensively about what she’ll one day tell her daughters about their first few months of life — and about how far she has come from the days when her “DNR” tattoo reflected a very different outlook.
“I want to live life, and I want to show them that they can live a good life,” Briggs said. “I want to be the light that makes them feel warm.”
Inside the program, she learned how to care for her daughters and, just as critically, how to care for herself, she said. For someone who had grown up without much love or guidance, the nursery became a place where both were taught, deliberately and daily.
She hopes to return someday to help others navigate the early months of parenthood behind bars.
“More mothers in this situation deserve an opportunity to learn to be a better mother.”

Pepper spoke highly of Acton, referring to her time helping lead the state during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I’ve greatly admired her leadership in a tough time, watched her save lives, took her marching orders, and as I’ve gotten to see her run, especially get involved, I just think she’s an incredibly deep candidate,” Pepper said.
Acton has been going around the state listening to people share their stories. 
“This is part of something that matters a lot to us, hearing from folks what is really going on in their life,” she said. 
Republican frontrunner Vivek Ramaswamy tapped Ohio Senate President Rob McColley as his running mate earlier this week. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who appointed Acton as ODH director in 2019, endorsed Ramaswamy on Wednesday. 
Pepper said he and Acton are the change candidates. 
“Both of us are outsiders to politics in different ways,” Pepper said. “The status quo of Ohio is not working for so many people. …  I think most people want to see something different.” 
Housing affordability was a common topic that was touched on by most of the six panelists on the roundtable. 
“Affordable housing is an enormous obstacle for the people that we work with,” said Matt Heaggans, owner of Preston’s: A Burger Joint in Columbus. “We see the impacts of that on people every day and the way that it gets people off track.”
Derrick Smith, a Columbus realtor with Keller Williams, explained how about one of out every three people he works with has an older family member provide assistance to help them buy a house. 
“First time buyers are where we really need to help,” he said. 
Acton experienced homelessness as a child growing up in the Youngstown area. 
“I can tell you that housing is going to be a big issue for me,” she said. 
Acton said she hears about the rising costs of living when traveling across the state, something she said she has experienced herself. 
“I don’t live not far from here and our electric bill went up $150 this summer,” she said. “…  Rent is high, everything is high. Every one of our health care costs is going up right now.”
Harvest Pizzeria owner Chris Crader shared his concerns about the rising costs of goods. 
“You can only raise your prices so much until you price your pizza out of affordability,” he said. 
In response, Acton and Pepper took turns blaming gerrymandering. 
“What happens when you have a super gerrymandered situation?” Acton asked. “Corruption takes hold and and that’s absolutely what this election is going to be about.”  
If a state is failing in multiple areas, something else is wrong, Pepper said. 
“What’s going wrong is we have a Statehouse, it’s gerrymandered,” he said.
Ohioans are ready for change, Acton said. 
“One of the reasons I’m running for governor is I just couldn’t look the other way anymore,” she said. “People are struggling. The state keeps going backwards on every measure.” 
This is a crisis moment for so many communities, Pepper said. 
“The issues we just heard about, broader economic issues, young people leaving, direct costs, challenges everyone faces,” he said. “In terms of stepping in, I think it’s a time for us and for so many others to get involved to try and change what is a troubling direction for a country, but especially for this state.”

The only two individuals who have stood trial for their role in the largest utility corruption scandal in Ohio’s history have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review their cases and reverse their convictions.


If the court accepts their case and ultimately rules in favor of the defendants, it would also likely affect two former FirstEnergy Corp. officials currently facing criminal charges in federal court as part of the multiyear House Bill 6 bailout scheme.


Such a precedent could have implications far beyond the state — and beyond the utility sector, too.


A win for the defendants could thwart any attempt to bring criminal charges against other individuals or companies that make large campaign contributions to a federal or state candidate in return for official action, such as awards of government contracts or preferred access to natural resources.


As part of the HB 6 saga, FirstEnergy and its affiliates funneled approximately $60 million through dark money groups to the tax-exempt organization Generation Now, which acted in coordination with Larry Householder’s official campaign to win reelection to the Ohio House of Representatives in 2018 and become speaker in 2019. In return, Householder used his power as speaker to push through a 2019 law to bail out two nuclear plants and two coal plants. Householder, lobbyist Matt Borges, and others then spent millions more of the FirstEnergy companies’ money to block a referendum effort to wipe out the law.


In sum, the scandal has cost Ohio ratepayers approximately half a billion dollars and delayed the state’s energy transition by gutting standards for energy efficiency and renewables and subsidizing the two 1950s-era coal plants.


 A questionable appeal

Federal agents arrested Householder, Borges, and three others in July 2020, and the government charged them with violating the federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. Although two individuals and Generation Now entered into plea deals and another defendant died, Householder and Borges went to trial. Jurors found them guilty in March 2023. That June, U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Black sentenced Householder to 20 years in prison. Borges received a five-year sentence.


FirstEnergy admitted its criminal liability in a 2021 court filing. Two of its former executives now face criminal charges in both federal and state courts, with the trial on the state charges set to start late this month. Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld both Borges’ and Householder’s convictions.


In petitions filed December 22, both convicted felons ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review their cases. Householder basically argues that the First Amendment protects companies giving money to candidates, and maintains that he can’t be criminally liable because his actions in connection with HB 6 carried out a campaign promise to FirstEnergy.


“That FirstEnergy had expectations attendant to the millions of dollars they donated to Householder’s 501(c)(4) is echoed by millions of Americans who make far more modest contributions to candidates — but who also expect that their candidate will come through for them,” the petition states. Letting the convictions stand would chill ​“the free exchange of ideas that the First Amendment protects, particularly in the arena of political speech,” it adds.

Borges makes similar arguments and then says that if Householder can’t be criminally liable, then neither can Borges be guilty of a criminal conspiracy under RICO.


The Department of Justice currently has until January 28 to respond to the defendants’ petitions. Four yes votes will be required from the sitting justices for the full court to hear the case.


Neither of the petitions notes that FirstEnergy’s contributions and any promises made by Householder were all secret. Money went through groups that don’t have to publicly report their donors. And Householder did not publicize an intent to push through a nuclear and coal bailout law that would have cost Ohioans more than $1 billion if all parts of it had gone into effect.


The petitions also gloss over the fact that Generation Now needed to avoid coordination with Householder’s campaign in order to avoid federal reporting and campaign finance limits, under the Supreme Court’s infamous Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission decision. Evidence at trial also showed that Householder spent some of the money for his personal benefit.


Although review of the cases is discretionary, the defendants’ arguments are already raising ire among some critics.


“Householder and Borges lamely suggest their political bribery, for which a jury of their peers found them guilty, should be excused because corruption ​‘happens every day.’ They hope the Supreme Court will turn a blind eye to bribery,” said Dick Munson, a former lobbyist for the Environmental Defense Fund who examined the HB 6 cases and other utility scandals in his 2025 book.


Yet several decisions by the Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief Justice John Roberts have already weakened federal law on corruption.


After the Citizens United case paved the way for companies to give unlimited amounts to organizations that don’t have to publicly report their donors, those organizations became ripe for use in concealing the true purpose of funds. David DeVillers, former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, called the case against Householder, Borges, and the others ​“likely the largest bribery money-laundering scheme ever perpetrated against the people of the state of Ohio.”


Ashley Brown, a former commissioner of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio who was the founding executive director of the Harvard Electricity Policy Group, also noted a more recent trend of the current Supreme Court ​“to just completely disregard findings of fact in the lower courts, casually casting them aside in order to make what I regard as policy, or perhaps simply partisan, statements.”


Consequently, he said, ​“what may appear to be a slam dunk in the Householder case to most of us may be seen quite differently by the SCOTUS majority.”

(Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images)If you were to make your personal Mount Rushmore of Kansas comedians, who would be on it?
The first three answers for me come quickly.
First (and second), I nominate the pair of Jason Sudeikis and Paul Rudd for their Shawnee Mission West pedigree and rise to super stardom in movies and television.
For Sudeikis, maybe your favorites include his sketches on “Saturday Night Live,” his turn as a soccer coach on “Ted Lasso” or the absurdity of “Horrible Bosses.”
My playlist for Rudd starts with his big stepbrother role in “Clueless” and marches along with his characters in “40-Year-Old Virgin” and “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy.”
Third, I am drafting University of Kansas grad Rob Riggle. The best goofy movies of the last few decades are on his resume: “The Hangover,” “The Other Guys,” and “Step Brothers.” (Unrelated to his bona fides, but helpful for my love of his work: We shared the same weekly waiting room outside our daughters’ dance class 15 years ago.)
My fourth slot in the Kansas comedy Mount Rushmore? 
Someone who has been making Hollywood headlines this week: Nikki Glaser.
Glaser, who graduated from KU after growing her standup career with jaunts to Kansas City, will host the Golden Globes for the second straight year Sunday. The broadcast, beginning at 7 p.m. on CBS, likely will kick off with the former Jayhawk delivering her monologue, which will likely toggle between roasting and toasting the biggest stars of movie and television.
Last year, she poked fun at …

The movie “Wicked”: “Everyone loved ‘Wicked.’ My boyfriend loved ‘Wicked.’ My boyfriend’s boyfriend loved ‘Wicked.’ ”
The mustache of actor Timothée Chalamet: “Can I just say you have the most gorgeous eyelashes … on your upper lip?”
The endless scandals of Hollywood: “I predict five years from now, when you are watching old clips of this show on YouTube, you’ll see someone in one of the crowd shots, and you’ll go, ‘That was before they caught that guy!’ ”

While Glaser grew up and now lives in the St. Louis area, she transferred to KU after visiting during a Final Four basketball weekend.
“It was the best weekend of my life,” she has said.
Majoring in English, Glaser graduated in 2006 as a woman obsessed with standup comedy. She asked her parents to support her for eight years while she refined her act.
Aside from her material for the Golden Globes, Glaser’s comedy is often unfairly labeled as simply sexual. Netflix tags her 2019 special as “no filter” and “raunchy.” Strutting the stage in a short skirt and talking about oral sex certainly steers people to that conclusion.
In 2016, Glaser told the University Daily Kansan that her comedy aims to make young women feel more confident and positive about sex.
“I know those kids are watching porn, I know those kids are seeing violent films and tons of sex — so they know what’s happening, and I would like to give them a different perspective on that stuff,” Glaser said.
So we arrive at one of my least proud parenting moments: I hit play on her 2022 stand-up special one Friday night sitting beside my daughter. I think we lasted a few minutes uncomfortably squirming in our seats as Glaser described her sex life before I nervously flicked off the TV.
Glaser, it turns out, was more ready for that talk than our family.
Glaser punctured the pop culture bubble with her 2024 roast of Tom Brady, offering a parade of jokes that burst onto social media and made headlines. Those punchlines, which skewered Brady for leaving his family and being so hot, made viewers blush or sputter — or both.
However, Glaser’s recent interviews and most recent special has shown both vulnerability and deeper meaning beyond hooking up and sex.
In lengthy interviews during 2024, she talked about her experiences with depression, eating disorders, suicidal thinking and body image. She sent Terry Gross reeling away from the microphone laughing during an interview on NPR’s “Fresh Air.”
Glaser explained how the atmosphere of the Kansas City and St. Louis comedy clubs encouraged dirty jokes. She told Gross how she would challenge herself to find out “how can you get groans? How can we offend the crowd? That was the goal, was just to say the grossest, most offensive thing.”
“So that was kind of my training ground,” she continued. “And obviously, it was more the way men talked offstage, I would say, than onstage, that made me think, ‘I just don’t want to be a part of this locker room talk where someone’s mocking me.’ ”
Glaser has also said that comedy can come from saying dark things that she shouldn’t say out loud.
“That’s always been the goal is just to mention the unmentionable,” Glaser told Gross. “And as I’ve dealt with, like, addictions and just problems with my mental health, it’s like — that’s always the answer to solving it, is admitting that there’s a problem. So it’s like, I kind of stumbled into comedy as a way to cope with all these feelings.”
Track the names of her comedy albums to see the recent change. From 2019’s “BANGIN’” to 2022’s “Good Clean Filth” to 2024’s “Someday You’ll Die.” The final special earned her 2024 Comedian of the Year from the New York Times humor columnist.
In a 2024 interview with Howard Stern, she talked about how her college years — both at KU and the University of Colorado — were times when she suffered the most psychologically, but also when she found a calling that saved her: standup comedy.
In her words, she “caught” anorexia as a teenager. Hoping to look thin for a date, she skipped all of her meals that day. Hearing from a friend that she looked great cemented the habit that would eventually threaten her life.
“The first time I did standup, I got off stage and I called my dad and I cried. We both cried,” she said. “They thought they were going to lose me. They had wrung their hands with it and given up because I wasn’t going to eat, and there was nothing they could really do with it. I was like, ‘I’ve gotta beat this because now I have something that I actually want to do and that I am good at. I have something to live for.’ ”
One of my favorite clips that I found while bouncing around the internet today on a Glaser tour was a 2019 appearance on KCTV’s “Better Kansas City.”
The production values are a lightyear away from the Golden Globes. Glaser sits on a comfy couch in an athleisure outfit with her hair pulled back in a casual ponytail. A gigantic, shiny leather chair holds the interviewer, who smiles as Glaser delivers these ambitious yet sarcastic, silly yet prophetic lines.
“I’m a really big deal,” Glaser said. “People might not know that. If you’re watching at home, like, I am going to be very famous very soon. I’m already more famous than I ever planned on being, which is not that famous. But, like, now’s the time to see me because I’m about to blow up. … Things are about to happen for me in a bigger way.”
As a longtime fan, it’s gratifying seeing Glaser explode in popularity now — at a moment when she is not just sexual on stage but intimate, not just candid in interviews but emotional.
The Golden Globes will be a fascinating showcase for a comedian with Kansas connections who is at the peak of her power.
One last note: This four-person comedy hall of fame is mine alone. So, I know that I am leaving out great folks. Here are some honorable mentions:

Del Close: A comedy innovator and mentor for many. I simply don’t know his work as well, despite his Manhattan, Kansas, roots.
Bridget Everett: I simply adore this second Manhattan honorable mention, including her willingness to be interviewed by me.
Mandy Patinkin: What a role in the “Princess Bride,” but the earnestness of his other work makes me see him as a dramatic actor.
Heidi Gardner: She has star power galore, but her biggest Kansas connection is two years at KU. I gift her to Missouri, where she belongs.
Terry Kiser: He starred in “Weekend at Bernie’s” and went to KU? That’s tempting, but can’t compete with the other filmographies.
Eric Stonestreet: I struggled the most here. Stonestreet is Kansas through and through and starred on “Modern Family.” Wish Mount Rushmore had five presidents for his sake.

(Official White House photo by Oliver Contreras)Ohio is a state built on strong communities and practical problem-solving. From church-run food programs to community organizations helping families stay afloat, our communities rely on organizations that step up when government agencies fall short.
That’s why the findings of a recent survey sponsored by Freedom and Faith Defense Project raise serious concerns as we head toward the 2026 Senate race.
According to the survey, if the 2026 congressional elections were held today, Ohio swing voters would choose a Democratic candidate by seven points. That shift alone is noteworthy in a state known for political balance. But the data also reveals why voters are moving: they see Washington overstepping, and they want elected leaders to push back.
A plurality of Ohio swing voters, 34%, believe that charities, community organizations, and religious organizations should face more general regulation. But when the question becomes specific, whether they support President Trump and Republicans in Congress increasing federal control over these groups, 47% say they oppose the idea, compared to just 22% who support it.
Ohioans know the difference between reasonable oversight and political intrusion.
The concern grows even sharper when it comes to the federal government’s recent actions. The survey shows that 60% of Ohio swing voters say the most concerning step Washington has taken is directing federal agencies to investigate and prosecute privately funded charities and religious groups for allegedly supporting domestic terrorism, often based on vague standards and limited due process.
Anyone familiar with our state’s community organizations understands why this alarms people. These are the organizations running after-school programs, providing addiction support in communities devastated by opioids, aiding struggling families, and filling gaps that government programs miss. They are not political actors, but they risk being treated like enemies if Washington’s approach continues.
The survey also found overwhelming opposition to one of the most extreme federal ideas floated in recent years: forcing banks to close accounts based on political or religious beliefs. Seventy-three percent of Ohio swing voters oppose such a policy. That level of consensus crosses every ideological line.
Ohio voters are signaling that they want leaders who will protect the independence of local charities and faith-based organizations, not leaders who will allow Washington to use its power to pressure or silence them.
This is not a partisan issue. It’s a community issue. Ohioans are rejecting the idea that federal bureaucrats should decide which ministries, community organizations, or religious groups are acceptable. They reject the notion that political winds in Washington should influence whether a local charity keeps its bank account or faces investigation.
As someone who has seen firsthand how essential these organizations are to families across Ohio, I believe we must take this moment seriously. Our next senators and representatives must commit to protecting the freedom of community organizations to serve, speak, and operate without fear of political retaliation.
The message from Ohio voters could not be clearer: Washington should support our local charities, ministries, and community organizations, not target them.

Brown",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/09/theres-no-one-that-doesnt-love-steny-official-maryland-reacts-to-hoyers-retirement/,"Tributes poured in for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th), who will step down after 60 years in public office, with official Maryland recalling a friend, mentor, colleague, dedicated public servant and natural politician who left his stamp on state and national politics.","Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Rep. Steny hoyer (D-5th) embrace before Moore and the state's congressional delegation met Monday on Capitol Hill. Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) is on the right and U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D) is in the background on the left. Photo by Josh Kurtz.Lisa Bianco was a campaign staffer for Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) from 2006 to 2012, when he was House Majority Leader, and said trying to introduce him to new people at that time posed a unique challenge.
“I used to joke that it was really hard to staff him because I’d run up and say, ‘Mr. Hoyer, I want to introduce you to so-and-so,’ and he’d say ‘Oh, of course I know them,’” said Bianco, who now works with the lobbying firm Perry Jacobson.
“He connects so well with people and it’s because it’s genuine, and it’s because he really cares about them,” she said. “He’s really invested in them, and he really is a true public servant.”
Hers was one of the many stories about Hoyer that came from Maryland’s political and community leaders Thursday after he announced from the floor of the House that he will not seek reelection this year to a 24th term in Congress. They remembered a friend, a mentor, a colleague, a dedicated public servant and a natural politician who left his stamp on state and national politics in a 60-year career.
Former Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md), whose working relationship with Hoyer dates back to 1967 when they were both in the General Assembly, called him a “loyal friend” and a decent card player in Hearts, but said one of Hoyer’s most important roles is mentor.
“We have so many new members in the Maryland Congressional delegation. He wanted to be able to help them as they started their congressional careers,” Cardin said. “Steny gives of himself every moment. And is effective in representing his people and in doing a lot of really good things. That’s a combination that’s going to be hard to duplicate.”
Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd) knows that from first-hand experience. Elfreth was a one-time intern in Hoyer’s office, but said she still relied on him when she became a colleague this year.

“He’s been someone I can consistently turn to, especially [during] tough moments and tough days on the floor,” Elfreth said. “I won’t know how to react or feel about the chaos down here, and I can find him on the floor, sit down and get his take on it. And inevitably, he has seen, in his six-decade career, something similar happen.”
Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), said in a social media post it would take “an entire novel” to summarize the congressman’s impact on the 5th district. In an interview Thursday, Alsobrooks recalled Hoyer was the first phone call she got after her 2010 victory as Prince George’s County state’s attorney.
“Someone handed me a phone and said, ‘You have a phone call.’ And it was the first call I received that night, and it was Steny Hoyer calling to congratulate me,” Alsobrooks said. “And from there, he has told me, any time you put your name up for office, I’m going to be there to support you.”
Hoyer was also the first person to suggest that Alsobrooks should seek federal office, about eight years ago.
“He was the person who called me on a Saturday, had me come meet him in an office, and said: ‘You know what, I think you should consider federal office,’” Alsobrooks said. “No one had ever said that to me before.”
When House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) served on the College Park City Council, from 2003-06, the city was still part of Hoyer’s 5th District.
“He’s someone that is highly respected, loved by all of us. Someone that has delivered for Maryland, has brought resources that are present in the community,” Peña-Melnyk said during an interview in her office in Annapolis. “There’s no one that doesn’t love Steny. He’s so charismatic. A hard worker, and has put Maryland on the map.”
‘A citizen again’
Hoyer’s influence in Maryland politics began in 1966 at age 27 after winning a seat in the state Senate. Nine years later, he became the youngest president in that chamber.
He was elected to the House in a special election in 1981 to represent the district that currently includes portions of Prince George’s and Anne Arundel counties and all three Southern Maryland counties of Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s.
During that time, he rose to serve as No. 2 Democrat in the House.
‘We must respect and love one another’: Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring

During that time, he also had a hand in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), for the Affordable Care Act and helping former President Joe Biden (D) get the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in 2021.
“We would not have the Americans with Disabilities Act without Steny Hoyer. We would not have the Affordable Care Act without him helping Speaker Pelosi whip those votes. We wouldn’t have the Democratic Caucus as it is, without a Steny Hoyer,” Elfreth said.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said in a statement that “Steny Hoyer’s fingerprints have been on countless pieces of historic policy achievements.” His impact on the 5th District is unmistakable, said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.)
“If you sort of drive through his congressional district and look out both sides of the window, you’re going to see something that Steny Hoyer helped make happen,” Van Hollen said.
One of Hoyer’s top achievements for Maryland was leading the effort to get the General Services Administration to relocate the aging FBI headquarters from Washington, D.C., to a site in Greenbelt, after 10 years of studies and battling Virginia officials who wanted the headquarters built in Springfield, Virginia.
But that achievement is in peril after President Donald Trump (R) announced last year that FBI headquarters, and its 6,000 employees, would stay in downtown Washington, D.C. A Republican-controlled Senate committee approved a resolution in October to help make it happen.
About a week later in November, Hoyer joined Gov. Wes Moore (D), Attorney General Anthony Brown (D) and others to announce the state had sued the administration to stop an action that would “unlawfully sabotage a multiyear collaborative effort” to relocate the facility to Greenbelt.
Hoyer said in an interview Thursday he will continue to challenge the Trump administration over the FBI move.
“The reason why the site is being changed has nothing to do with the suitability for the FBI, and everything to do with the animus that the president of the United Sates directs towards the FBI, and frankly towards Prince George’s County,” he said. “I’m going to try keep to convincing my colleagues in Congress that a short-term political decision is harmful in this case.”
Thursday’s announcement by Hoyer, 86, follows a similar announcement by 85-year-old Pelosi, the Baltimore-born Democrat who has represented California in the House for more than three decades. Pelosi will also step down at the end of her term in January 2027.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
During part of his 10-minute speech, Hoyer choked up a few times. He had a quick reply when asked what brought that on.
“The past 65 years,” he said. “I have been involved in an enterprise that I really enjoy. I love the interface with the public. I love the interface with the fellow members of the state Senate, or state Board of Higher Education, or the Congress of the United States.”
Hoyer continued: “I love working on behalf of communities and people to try to make their lives better and make the communities more successful. When you’re ending that and walking into a much slower pace of life, which my wife is going to enjoy. It was emotional. When you do something for a long time and you like it, and you decide to walk away voluntarily … it has an emotional tug on you.”

“We never flinched,” said Beck, who threw for 268 yards and two touchdowns with an interception. “In the face of adversity, when we had to respond, we responded.”

The 10th-ranked Hurricanes (13-2) didn’t play in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game and were a somewhat controversial CFP pick – at least outside of South Florida – yet proved they belong. They will face either top-ranked Indiana or No. 5 Oregon in the national title game on Jan. 19.
Miami held Texas A&M and reigning national champion Ohio State to a combined 17 points to reach the CFP semifinals. Then the Hurricanes shut down the high-scoring Rebels (13-2) for three quarters in the desert before pulling it out in a wild fourth.

Trinidad Chambliss, a year removed from winning a Division II title at Ferris State, led the Rebels down the field and found Dae’Quan Wright for a 24-yard touchdown with 3:13 left.
Then it was Beck’s turn. He won a national title as a backup at Georgia before two productive seasons as the Bulldogs’ starter. Beck kept the Hurricanes calm amid the storm, leading them down the field for the winning score — and a shot at a national title on their home field at Hard Rock Stadium. Beck is 37-5 as a starter, including two seasons at Georgia.
“He’s hungry, he’s driven, he’s a great human being, and all he wants to do is to see his teammates have success,” said Mario Cristobal, in his fourth season coaching his alma mater. “And that’s what we witnessed tonight.”

Chambliss completed two passes to get Ole Miss to the Miami 35 with 6 seconds left, but his heave to the end zone fell incomplete as time expired.
The sixth-seeded Rebels lost their coach before the playoff, but not their cool.
If anything, Lane Kiffin’s decision to bolt for LSU seemed to harden Ole Miss’ resolve, pushing the Rebels to the best season in school history — and within a game of their first national championship game.
Ole Miss took the lead on Lucas Caneiro’s fourth field goal, from 21 yards, and seemed poised to continue its improbable run with Chambliss’ TD pass to Wright.

The Rebels couldn’t hold back the Hurricanes on their final drive, but what a run it was.
With Pete Golding calling the shots after being promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach, and most of the assistants sticking around, the Rebels blew out Tulane to open the playoff and took down mighty Georgia in the CFP quarterfinals.
They faced a different kind of storm in the Hurricanes.
Miami has rekindled memories of its 2001 national championship team behind a defense that went from porous to nearly impenetrable in its first season under coordinator Corey Hetherman.
The Hurricanes walled up early in the Fiesta Bowl, holding Ole Miss to minus-1 yard.

One play revved up the Rebels and their rowdy fans.
Kewan Lacy, the nation’s third-leading rusher, burst through a hole up the middle for a 73-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second quarter — the longest run allowed by Miami’s defense since 2018.
The Hurricanes seemed content to grind away at the Rebels in small chunks offensively, setting up CharMar Brown’s 4-yard touchdown run and a field goal.
Miami unlocked the deep game just before halftime, taking advantage of a busted coverage for a 52-yard touchdown pass from Beck to Keelan Marion.

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)A federal judge ruled this week that Florida violated the constitutional rights of hundreds of thousands of people it had removed from the Medicaid rolls following the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, when it sent beneficiaries “vague, confusing and often incorrect and misleading” termination letters.
In a 273-page ruling in the class action, U.S. District Judge Marcia Morales Howard ordered the state in the next two months to send appropriate Medicaid termination notices to roughly 500,000 low-income people whose benefits the state terminated for financial reasons following the pandemic and were not subsequently re-enrolled in the safety-net health care program.
The notice must advise the people of the court’s ruling and, at a minimum, must include “an unambiguous statement” explaining the financial reasons behind the terminations and to whom the decision applies. 
“Such notice will ensure that all Class Members have the information needed to determine whether the State’s decision to terminate their Medicaid benefits was correct,” she wrote. “Class Members who believe the State made an error may then pursue the available administrative remedies to correct that error.”
Those “remedies” include an opportunity to request an administrative appeal of their termination, which would enable someone to temporarily be re-enrolled in Medicaid pending the outcome of the hearing. The notice must include information about administrative procedures permitting the payment of past medical bills if an error is found.

Howard in her ruling also barred the Department of Children and Families — the Florida agency that determines whether people qualify for Medicaid — from terminating someone’s benefits for financial eligibility unless it provides proper notice. 
That notice must include must include, at a minimum the enrollee’s household size, the state-determined countable household income; the eligibility category in which the enrollee had been receiving benefits, and, if it changed, the reason for the change. 
The DCF did not immediately comment on the ruling or whether it plans to appeal the decision. 
“Welcome news”
Joan Alker executive director and co-founder of the Center for Children and Families (CCF) and a research professor at the Georgetown McCourt School of Public Policy.
Center for Children and Families Executive Director Joan Alker said Thursday she still was reading the lengthy ruling but that she wasn’t surprised by the judge’s conclusions.
Alker, who has spent more than 20 years studying Florida’s Medicaid program, said the state has a “really complicated” Medicaid system, which includes the optional Medicaid expansion for children called Kidcare. The more complicated the system, she said, the more important it is for termination letters to be easily understood.
“I think it’s welcome news for families that, here, the judge recognized that this was a very serious problem that families were facing,” she said. “And again, I’ll say that I found the notices extremely difficult to understand and, obviously, I’m a health policy professor who’s been working on this stuff for decades.”
Medicaid is a safety net health care program jointly administered and paid for by the state and federal governments. Just under 4 million people were enrolled in Medicaid in Florida as of Nov. 30, 2025, the latest available data.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government increased by 6.2% its contributions to the Medicaid program. The increased funding came with the caveat that states couldn’t disenroll people during the pandemic.
The policy ballooned Florida’s Medicaid caseload from 3.8 million people in March 2020, before to the pandemic, to more than  5.75 million in March 2023. 
Congress agreed the continuous eligibility requirement would end March 31, 2023, and that, post-pandemic, states could return their Medicaid programs to their normal operations. That process was known as Medicaid “unwinding.”
Florida started its Medicaid unwinding on April 1, 2023, and by the following year DCF redetermined the Medicaid eligibility of more than 4 million people.
Attorneys for Florida Health Justice Project and the National Health Law Program filed the lawsuit in Jacksonville in 2023 on behalf of people who erroneously lost benefits. Howard agreed to certify it as a class action in 2024.
“This ruling is a victory for the millions of Floridians who rely on Medicaid for essential health care. Medicaid agencies inevitably make mistakes when deciding eligibility. Clear, easy-to-understand notices are essential to catch and correct those mistakes before someone loses health care. The Court’s decision will ensure that Floridians have that critical protection from now on,”  Sarah Grusin, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program. said in a prepared statement Thursday.
“It also underscores that states cannot shirk their constitutional obligations. Florida has known about the problems with their notices for years but has not addressed them, citing the cost and complexity of making changes to the computer system that generates notices. But as the Court emphasized, state officials cannot justify violating the constitutional rights of their citizens because they claim the fix is too expensive.”

“Poorest of the poor”
There are two broad category groups: “SSI-Related Medicaid” for people who are aged, blind, or disabled in the community, and “Family-Related Medicaid” for children, parents, and other caretakers of children, pregnant women, and former foster children under the age of 26.
The lawsuit focuses on “Family Related Medicaid” beneficiaries, whom Howard described as some of the state’s “most vulnerable citizens.”
“They are primarily pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children. And as is evident from the applicable income standards, these individuals are the poorest of the poor,” Howard said. “Prior to terminating the Medicaid benefits on which these individuals depend, the Constitution requires the State of Florida to provide them with adequate notice. The State of Florida is violating this constitutional requirement. “
Regardless of the eligibility group, residents also must meet certain income requirements, which vary by, among other things, age and household composition. 
The complicated details of how household income is derived are laid out in policy manuals which, Howard noted in her ruling, are “plainly designed for internal use by those who have been taught how to use it … .” 
Howard’s lengthy ruling also touches on the DCF call center operations and its website.
Florida wrongly kicked postpartum women and their newborns out of Medicaid

Using April 2024 as an example, Howard noted, the call center received more than 1.9 million phone calls, of which 593,923 were resolved with interactive voice response system through which people can self serve.
Another 1.38 million-plus callers asked to speak with an agent for a variety of reasons, including long wait times and abandoned phone calls; only 32% ( 444,319 callers) who requested to speak with a live agent succeeded. Upon reaching an agent, those interactions lasted for an average of nine minutes and 28 seconds, including the time the agent spent working on the case after the call ended. 
Meanwhile, termination letters referred resident to the DCF website to learn more about eligibility requirements, but Howard noted in her ruling that the webpage didn’t provide all the information people needed or the links to get the information. In some instances, information on DCF’s homepage was incorrect or incomplete. 
“The length of this Order might suggest that the question before the Court — whether the State’s notices are constitutionally adequate — is overly complex or a razor close call. It is neither. The length of this Order is not reflective of the complexity of the legal issue, it is reflective of the complexity and unreasonably confusing nature of the notices. It is driven by the need to address the complete inadequacy and borderline incomprehensibility of the notices and the inadequacy of the other resources identified as remedying the failure of the NOCAs [notices of case action] at issue,” she wrote.
“As detailed in this Order, the Court’s review of the evidence and the notices — their structure, the confusing, contradictory, and often misleading reasons they provide, and the lack of alternate available sources for the necessary information — inescapably leads to the conclusion that the State’s notices are fundamentally insufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.”

The first time I walked into a Connecticut drive-thru, I realized something that shocked my younger self: I missed home because I missed the food. Connecticut may pride itself on being the Pizza Capital of the United States, but for anyone raised in the South, that crown doesn’t solve the state’s biggest problem — it lacks the fast-food culture that keeps everyday meals fun, comforting and quick. 



Before Nutmeggers fire their ovens to defend New Haven, let me acknowledge the obvious: Connecticut has world-class pizza. The state is so proud of it that the governor’s office issued a press release doubling down on the title, even noting that there are 1,376 pizza restaurants statewide and 63 in New Haven alone.
And yes, the pies are incredible. Many are handmade, cooked in old ovens and worth the wait. 
But that’s the point: You have to wait. A lot. 
Most weekends, you’ll stand in line at Pepe’s longer than it takes to drive from New Britain to Hartford. Connecticut pizza may be extraordinary, but it’s not fast food. And it can’t replace what the South does best: comfort meals you can get in minutes. 
As a North Carolina native now living in Connecticut, here are three things this state needs to truly level up its food game: 

 A legendary fast-food chain — ideally Bojangles.

Southerners don’t go to Bojangles. We return to it. It’s fried chicken that tastes like home, biscuits you can’t replicate, and seasoned fries that make road trips worth it. 

Max Frazier

Connecticut may not realize it, but people here miss it too. Some residents literally drive from Connecticut to North Carolina just for Bojangles, as shown in this Reddit thread from transplanted Southerners longing for a “Bojangles fix.” Another Reddit post raves about trying Bojangles for the first time. 
Even YouTube creators have jumped in, praising the chain with videos like this review of its famous chicken and biscuits. 
There’s also a full breakdown of the chain’s significance in “The Untold Truth of Bojangles,” which you can read here. For an outside perspective, a Connecticut-based writer included Bojangles in a ranking of the best Southern chains.
And recently, Bojangles made business news when reports suggested the company is up for sale — a reminder of how culturally important it is to its fans.
Bottom line: Bojangles has more than 800 locations across 17 states, a loyal fan base and a flavor profile the Northeast simply doesn’t match. 

 More variety. The South’s fast-food universe is huge.

A writer who lived in both New England and the South described the contrast clearly in this Business Insider piece: “The fast-food options are seemingly endless in the South.”
North Carolina has Cook Out, Zaxby’s, Biscuitville, Smithfield’s Chicken ’N Bar-B-Q, and more. Connecticut has far fewer regional chains, meaning fewer signature flavors and fewer low-cost comfort foods. It’s not just about fried chicken — it’s about choice. 

 A stronger culture of quick, flavorful meals.

Fast food in N.C. isn’t just food — it’s rhythm. It’s grabbing a Cajun Filet Biscuit before school, hitting Cook Out after a late game or stopping at Bojangles on road trips because you know exactly what that first bite will taste like. Connecticut leans heavily on sit-down meals and pizza culture. Great traditions, but not always practical for families, students or workers looking for fast, inexpensive meals on the go. 
The Counterargument: But Connecticut Has Pizza. 
True — Connecticut has some of the best pizza in the country, and locals love it fiercely. But pizza isn’t filling the same role Bojangles does in North Carolina. It’s not a drive-thru meal; it’s not a cultural touchstone, and it doesn’t come with a sweet tea strong enough to fix a bad day. Pizza can be phenomenal while still leaving a gap in the food landscape. 
The Solution 
It’s time for Connecticut to welcome a major Southern chain, ideally Bojangles, and embrace the culture that comes with it. Even a single location would bring new flavors, new customers, new jobs and maybe even a new sense of identity around quick comfort food. Connecticut doesn’t have to stop loving pizza. But it can expand its palate — and its drive-thru options. 
Because here’s the truth that no Connecticut resident wants to hear from a Southerner: Your pizza is amazing. But you have no idea how good life can be with a Bo-Berry Biscuit.

CT DOT is considering it” outlined a DOT proposal to widen the section of Interstate 95 in Stamford. In a time of great progress for our small state, we are apparently back to an era of regressivism. 
After the signing of HB 8002, we can now finally see the future of Connecticut housing plans. Front and center of this bill was the focus on transit oriented development, something that this administration has been focused on. This is great news for people living in our cities who understand the need for safe and pedestrian-first streets.
It has been too long in this nation that we put automobiles first, and finally, we have hit a turning point where they will continue to rule no longer. The discussion of another lane being added to our interstate is an absurd attack on our cities and societies. The “one more lane” mentality lent us the destruction of much of our downtown areas in Stamford, Bridgeport, New Haven, and most notably, Hartford. The highway has tormented our society, and we should not continue to support these massive superhighway projects. Our state has vowed to do better for the people, not the automobiles. Cars are not your taxpayers; we are –the 3.6 million Nutmeggers who call this state home.
There is a consensus among planners that adding one more lane will never and has never fixed traffic; the only solution is getting people off the roads in the first place by way of transit. Instead of adding a lane of the highway at a cost of $10 million per mile, the state could make dedicated busways across our state that will improve the roads for the thousands (and growing) that use our buses every day. The effect that would have on commuters would benefit more people than any highway infrastructure spending ever could. Planning and adding paint reading “Bus Only” to our streets is much more cost-effective than appending to an already enormous concrete structure that divides communities.
The people of Connecticut want our tax dollars to be spent in ways that improve our lives for the best value, exactly what state government should look like. Our state has been here for us recently when our federal government let us down; the state cannot afford to lose the trust of the people like it had eight years ago. 
They must continue their course of good. I hope that common sense will prevail and shut down the discussion of this for the last time because, “Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need [more] roads!”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)At a protest Thursday in the neighborhood where an immigration officer killed Renee Nicole Good Wednesday, Omar Dasea-Torres said he joined the demonstration even though he fears for his own safety despite his legal status.
“I don’t think it’s fair what they’re doing right now, taking families,” Dasea-Torres said.
Over a thousand people joined Dasea-Torres Thursday. They walked the streets under a steady, cold rain, blocking traffic, blocks away from where Good, 37, was fatally shot Wednesday morning by a federal immigration agent who has been identified as Jonathan Ross by the Star Tribune.
Many protestors likely have vivid memories of days of demonstrations following the murder of George Floyd, less than a mile from here.
Minneapolis residents have borne the brunt of the latest wave of immigration agents — said to be 2,000 — sent to Minnesota this week by the Department of Homeland Security.
No federal or local law enforcement appeared to be present at the Thursday evening protest. Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the Minnesota National Guard “out of an abundance of caution” to be prepared to help local law enforcement keep order.

Protests have been ongoing since the shooting. Protesters gathered at the scene immediately after the shooting; later that evening, thousands gathered to mourn Good in an evening vigil and a protest against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.
Early Thursday morning, protesters clashed with federal agents at the Whipple Building, the federal building ICE has been using. The Star Tribune reported that agents threw some protesters to the ground and detained them; one protester was detained for throwing an apple core at a squad car.
And later that morning, more than 100 multifaith religious leaders huddled around the site of the shooting, which has been turned into a memorial for Good, to make three demands: that ICE leave Minnesota; that the federal government allow state investigators access to evidence for an independent state investigation; and that Congress also investigate the shooting.
A speech written by Jovita Morales from the Minnesota Immigrant Movement opened the Thursday evening protest, which was jointly organized and publicized on social media by local chapters of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, 50501 and the Democratic Socialists of America.
“The incident in which an ICE agent took the life of our community member and a young woman demonstrates a complete lack of preparation and serious negligence. We demand justice through an investigation,” said Ivonne Hernandez, who delivered the speech on behalf of Morales.
On Wednesday, the feds kicked Minnesota criminal investigators off what was initially a joint investigation. The maneuver has drawn sharp criticism from local officials and protesters, who demanded an investigation independent from the federal government, whose top officials have already publicly drawn conclusions that contradict existing video evidence.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a press conference Wednesday that Good “weaponized her vehicle” and “attempted to run a law enforcement officer over.” A video provided to the Reformer shows an officer positioning himself in front of the vehicle and firing three shots through the windshield as Good attempted to turn the car away from the officer.
Ben Andrews wasn’t aware of the protest in advance but saw it passing by his house. Andrews said he’s been receiving neighborhood notifications of ICE presence “semi-regularly.”
“This used to be a great neighborhood. This neighborhood was going up. All this ICE sh*t doesn’t make anybody better,” Andrews said.

(Photo by Adrian Ashford/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — More than 150 people gathered Thursday night in front of the Statehouse to protest the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and an agent’s fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman in Minneapolis. 
Organizers from the South Carolina chapters of 50501 and the Party for Socialism and Liberation gave brief speeches before leading most of the crowd on a 0.6-mile march to Columbia City Hall and back. 
Police cars blocked off portions of Main Street as the crowd walked, chanting slogans condemning Wednesday’s killing of Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three who was shot through the windshield by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Police cars also followed the walkers. 
The protest in the state capital remained peaceful and lasted for about two hours. 
It began along Gervais Street on the sidewalk in front of the Statehouse, with people waving American flags and holding signs with slogans including “stop ICE terror” and “stop attacking U.S. citizens.” People honked their horns as they drove by.
Samantha Rainwater of Columbia, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, told the SC Daily Gazette that the group marched to city hall to discourage Columbia leaders from signing agreements with ICE or expanding its presence in the city.
Across South Carolina, 19 counties, 10 cities and two state law enforcement agencies participate in ICE’s 287(g) program, named for the section of a 1996 law that authorized it. They do not include Columbia or Richland County. The most recent participant, Elloree Police Department in Orangeburg County, signed on Wednesday, according to ICE’s website.
Minnesota and national leaders have disagreed sharply on the circumstances surrounding Good’s death, which has prompted large protests in Minneapolis and across the country. 
Video of the shooting shared with the Minnesota Reformer, an affiliate of the Gazette, shows officers approaching a vehicle stopped in the middle of a snowy road. One yells at her to get out and tries to open the door. Good slowly backs up, then pulls forward as she begins to drive away. An officer at the front of the vehicle, identified in court records as Jonathan Ross, shoots three times. 
At a news conference Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the officer acted in self-defense. She alleged Good was attempting to kill him with her vehicle, which she called an “act of domestic terrorism.” Vice President JD Vance continued Thursday to call it self-defense.
Sigourney Howell, a 27-year-old EMT who lives in Sumter, said she came to the protest because she worries about what’s next for America. What can be seen and heard on video doesn’t match what officials are saying, she said.
Brenda Peake said she came from Rock Hill to join the Statehouse protest because she believes the government is lying about what happened to Good, and she couldn’t stay quiet. 
“You look at the videos and you can see that she’s trying to get away,” said the 77-year-old, who used to work for the North Carolina Department of Corrections. “As a female, I know if a guy in a mask and a big gun came up to my car, I would try to get away. It’s just an instinct.”

Spencer Cox and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz sign an agreement giving Utah a greater role in managing national forest land, at the Utah Capitol on Jan. 8, 2026. (Photo courtesy of Gov. Spencer Cox's office). Utah has had more than 7 million acres of national forest for over a century but not the say it wanted in managing them. That changed Thursday morning when the state finalized a new agreement with the U.S. Forest Service, intended in part to expand logging. 
“This is something we’ve been working for — wanting — literally, for generations in our state,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said at the state Capitol before signing the document. “And now the moment is here where we can be involved on the front end of these decisions.”
Utah is the third state to formalize such an agreement with the Forest Service this year, following Idaho and Montana. The compacts come after President Donald Trump directed federal agencies in March to speed approval of logging projects and set goals for timber sales, calling it a way to reduce wildfire risk. 
Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz joined Cox at the Capitol to sign the agreement. He said it provides the state “a seat at the table, side by side,” rather than simply a chance to give input in how the lands are managed.
“The term I like is cooperative federalism, but there’s a role for the states to manage federal lands, and that’s what we’re doing here today,” Schultz said.

Conservation groups blasted the agreement as Utah’s latest move to assume greater control of public lands. They said it sets the stage for a vast expansion of commercial logging.  
“They’re just using wildfire as an excuse to manage in a way that gives money to the timber industry,” said Laura Welp with the Western Watersheds Project. 
Welp said supporters of the new arrangement overstate the benefits of removing timber in reducing wildfire. She noted the influence of weather, high winds, drought and climate change. Habitat restoration, which involves smaller-scale operations, can be used to manage risk, she said, rather than big commercial logging projects. 
Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said the change “sets the stage for Utah officials to have both a heavy hand and the loudest voice in how our national forests are managed, crowding out all other stakeholders. That’s not how this is supposed to work, and we’ll be watching closely to see how the agreement plays out on the ground.”
Joel Ferry, executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, rejected the notion that the deal is a gift to the timber industry. 
“I wouldn’t agree with that,” he said. “I mean, certainly, we take our environment very seriously. We care for it. It’s part of who we are.” 
In April, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins declared a crisis on national forest lands, citing severe wildfires and other stressors “compounded by too little active management.” Rollins directed the Forest Service to expand agreements with states “to bring the full power of our partners to help address this emergency.”
Before Thursday, Utah and the Forest Service have long had more limited compacts, Ferry told reporters after the event.   
Thursday’s version goes further than Idaho’s and Montana’s, making Utah a partner in decisions about logging, cattle grazing, recreation, wildlife and forest restoration, Ferry said.

Leland Pollock, a rancher and chair of the Garfield County Commission, attended the announcement and looked on as Cox and Schulz signed the agreement. He’s long advocated for reduced federal oversight of public lands, including the downsizing of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. 
Asked if he sees the new framework as a step toward greater state control of other public lands like national monuments, Pollock laughed, saying, “Oh, hell, no, don’t say that.” 
“We’re not going to make the forest unhealthy or worse,” he said. “We’re going to make it better.” 
The agreement applies to more than 8 million acres of national forest and adjacent land in Utah. It does not pertain to other vast stretches of federally managed land overseen by the Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service.

(Justin Taylor/The Current GA/Catchlight Local/Report for America)The seven Democratic candidates vying to become governor addressed Coastal Georgia voters Thursday in the first major policy forum of the election year, with each aiming to distinguish themselves amid a crowded race for the state’s top job.
Georgia Democrats are hoping that the lack of incumbent — current Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, will leave office at the end of 2026 due to term limits — and rising economic difficulties will boost their party’s chances of winning the powerful position for the first time in more than 20 years.
The seven Democrats who took the stage were former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; Olu Brown, a businessman and retired pastor; former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan; former state Sen. Jason Esteves, who also runs three family businesses; state Rep. Derrick Jackson, a U.S Navy veteran and former General Electric official; community activist and state Rep. Ruwa Romman; and former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.

While the group presented a diverse range of ages, race, professional experience and socioeconomic backgrounds, the candidates sounded very similar when it came to policy positions, leaving it unclear how they will ultimately differentiate themselves for party faithful who vote in the May primary.
The one-hour event held at Savannah’s Jonesville Baptist Church allowed candidates to introduce themselves and highlight their credentials to run the state, yet covered only four main topics: health care, economic development and workforce training, the Trump administration and housing.
The format allowed for one-minute answers and discouraged criticism or debate among the candidates. Candidates’ answers, as a result, sounded very similar. Everyone promised to expand Medicaid as a way to help increase health care coverage, a policy that Gov. Kemp and the Republican-led legislature have rejected although 40 other states have adopted. Each person proposed expanding an affordable housing fund and rental assistance to help improve home ownership and help Georgians build stable futures. They also all agreed that technical training and community college should be free to all adults in the state.
Time did not allow for expansive discussions of how to pay for these programs, but many candidates suggested using some of Georgia’s $14 billion budget surplus for these efforts.
Organizers said they chose the format to promote civility and thoughtful answers for the top concerns of Coastal Georgia voters. Organizers were also unabashed in reminding candidates that any victory to statewide office would require engagement from voters outside of Atlanta.
“Chatham County is one of the largest counties in the state, and the 1st Congressional District is a big part of Georgia’s economy and growth. We want folks to take us as a region seriously,” Chatham County Commissioner Aaron “Adot” Whitely, chairman of the Democratic Party of Chatham County.

Ahead of the forum, two of the area’s most influential Democrats got roaring standing ovations from the approximately 1,000 attendees in the church sanctuary: Alicia Johnson, the Savannah native and new member of the Public Service Commission whose electoral victory in November made her the first Black woman to win a statewide race in Georgia, and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson. The two officials are not related, and both are expected to help turn out the vote, both in the spring primary and in November, for all Democrats running for state office.
Bottoms, the former Atlanta mayor, is a close ally and friend of the Savannah leader. While he has not formally endorsed her, she used her closing statement to call him out by name on the stage.
Johnson, however, confirmed to The Current after the forum that he had not made a decision about which candidate he would back. “Several of the candidates are friends of mine,” the mayor said.
The Democratic forum was the first in a planned “Savannah Debate Series” being organized by the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Savannah Black Chamber of Commerce, the Chatham County Democratic Party and the Chatham County Republican Party, as well as local news station WJCL. The group plans to hold a Republican gubernatorial forum in the spring, followed by a general election debate between the party nominees for the governor’s race later this year.
March 6 is the last day for candidates to qualify to run for the November election. Primaries to select the Democratic and Republican nominees for governor, as well as other state offices, and U.S. Senator will take place on May 19.

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)A trio of bills targeting local cooperation with federal immigration agents and expanding protections for immigrants is expected to go before the full Legislature Monday after they advanced through two legislative committees Thursday.
The package of bills is being fast-tracked after a similar measure languished for more than a year. Senate President Nicholas Scutari told reporters that he plans to support them, though he worries about the proposals making New Jersey a target of the federal government.
“I fear for the people that are advocating for this getting what they ask for, and maybe it’s not exactly what they expect. I think it could have unintended consequences for lots of folks,” Scutari said Thursday ahead of the bills clearing committees.

The bills’ advancement came a day after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis during a civil immigration enforcement operation. Sen. Britnee Timberlake (D-Essex) said that the “killing of a young, 37-year-old mother, American citizen, white woman, blonde hair, shows that this can happen to everyone.”
“What the federal government is directing for ICE to carry out is wrong, and I do believe and look for a day in the future where history will speak for itself and that those who are carrying out these illegal acts will find themselves in the same position as those who carried out the illegal acts in Nazi Germany through the Nuremberg trials,” Timberlake said. “It’s wrong what we’re seeing, and these bills are just a slight step in the right direction to try to protect our citizens as much as we can.”
The legislation was passed late Thursday in the Assembly Appropriations Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee with opposition from the Republicans on both panels.
“This just promotes lawlessness and makes our state less safe,” said Assemblyman Greg Myhre (R-Ocean).
The White House last week issued a statement criticizing the Legislature for moving the bills and saying the body should “focus on protecting law-abiding citizens, not the criminal aliens who kill them.”
The package of bills includes legislation to codify the Immigrant Trust Directive, an attorney general order that limits cooperation between federal immigration authorities and New Jersey law enforcement. The bill would bar police officers from engaging in “racially influenced policing,” like stopping someone based on their suspected citizenship status; require agencies to develop procedures for certain visa requests; and mandate that prosecutors inform criminal defendants of immigration consequences of some charges and convictions.
The second measure would require the state to develop policies for “sensitive locations” — like some health care centers, schools, and shelters — that would prohibit federal civil immigration enforcement on the premises. The third bill would bar government entities and health care facilities from asking for certain personal information, like immigration status, in some cases.
Immigrant advocates have been urging lawmakers to codify the protections for immigrants, pointing to the drastic increase in immigration enforcement and the fact that any future attorney general could withdraw the directive.
Dozens of people testified Thursday during the hourslong hearings, and the vote in the Assembly came just before 9 p.m. Witnesses shared stories of immigrant residents who fear federal agents, children who have come home to find their parents were arrested, and businesses that have suffered as a result of the fear of authorities.
“Laws like this are necessary to build a firewall against an unaccountable, militarized deportation force. But we’re under no illusions that this will be enough. The federal administration will keep coming, and New Jersey will need to stay ready with additional protections as new threats emerge,” said Nedia Morsy, director of immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New Jersey.
The bills will likely go before the Senate and Assembly on Monday. Gov. Phil Murphy, whose final day in office is Jan. 20, declined to say Thursday whether he would sign or veto them.
Republican legislators voiced concerns about the bills regulating the federal government, which is barred by the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause. Sen. Raj Mukherji (D-Hudson), a sponsor of the bill, waved away that criticism.
“Counties sued us, Trump administration 1.0 sued us — sequels are often worse, and I would say this one definitely is — but the U.S. District Court of New Jersey upheld the directive. The 3rd Circuit affirmed it,” he said. “This is legal, and Congress can regulate the conduct of private actors, but they can’t make the states use their resources to do the job of federal immigration enforcement.”
Timberlake added: “They can bring in their own resources to do it.”

Josh Shapiro speaks at a rally in Philadelphia where he and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis kicked off their 2026 reelection campaign, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. (Photo by Peter Hall/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Kicking off their campaign for a second term, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis offered a vision where Pennsylvanians have abundant opportunities for success, affordable and safe communities and the rights and freedoms they value.
At rallies Thursday in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Shapiro and Davis revisited their successes and the work left to do as the commonwealth and the nation face foundational challenges amid what the governor called “chaos and the toxicity” in the nation’s capital.
“We’ve got more people to help, and we’ve got more problems to solve,” Shapiro told the crowd gathered at a youth basketball center in Philadelphia. “And so with a servant’s heart and an ear to your concerns, progress made, and with a hunger to do more for you, I am here to announce that I am running for reelection as governor of this great commonwealth.”
But Shapiro said he could not tout the administration’s success without acknowledging that Pennsylvania families are suffering because of the Republican-controlled federal government’s cuts to food assistance and health insurance tax credits.
“Some politicians who know better — are too cowardly to speak up. They abandoned their principles … and in an attempt to position themselves to be better off, they leave a whole lot of others behind,” he said, noting that nearly 500,000 Pennsylvanians will be unable to afford health insurance and more than 100,000 will lose SNAP benefits.
During his speech, Shapiro had to pause several times as the crowd in Philadelphia — about 1,000, according to the campaign’s estimate — spontaneously chanted an earthier version of the campaign catchphrase “get stuff done.” Shapiro used the slogan several times as he outlined accomplishments during his first three years in the governor’s office.

They included the state response to the Interstate 95 disaster that defined the early months of his term, to increases in education funding approaching 30%, eliminating red tape involved in starting a business and hiring 2,000 new state troopers, attracting $35 billion in new private investments and eliminating a college degree requirement for 92% of state jobs. 
“I’m running for reelection to continue that work, and I’m running for reelection because I have never backed down from a fight,” he said, adding, “Right now, we are in a battle to protect the very foundation upon which the place we call home was founded.”
With prices for food, energy, vehicles and other goods soaring, businesses and families are struggling and farmers without markets for their products, Shapiro said the federal government’s actions threaten to erode progress in the commonwealth.
He added that he feels Pennsylvanians’ worries about feeding their families and being stripped of their rights.
“Every step of the way, I’ve stood up for my fellow Pennsylvanians, sometimes in a court of law, and other times by simply refusing to back down, refusing to cast certain Pennsylvanians aside, and always by speaking truth to power,” Shapiro said.
Davis said the campaign wasn’t about him and Shapiro but the potential of state government when it invests and believes its people.
“It’s about being honest and clear eyed and honest about what this moment calls for and the leadership it takes to meet it, because things are very different from when Josh and I were first elected,” Davis said. 
“The stakes are higher than they’ve ever been and we all have a choice to make — follow the politics of fear and division coming from politicians in Washington,” Davis said. “Or we can stand up for our freedom, make our own choices and show the nation what’s possible when great leadership is at the helm.”
Elected in 2022, Shapiro already carried formidable political clout as the sitting state attorney general in his first gubernatorial run. He stood out nationally by suing the first Trump administration over its policies and companies that profited from the broad adoption of opioid painkillers that led to an epidemic of overdose deaths. Shapiro was also a Montgomery County commissioner and a state representative.

Davis was in his second term as a state representative in Allegheny County representing his hometown of McKeesport when he became the commonwealth’s first Black lieutenant governor.
They defeated state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R-Frankllin), a Trump loyalist and election denier who has introduced legislation to outlaw chemtrails, by 15 points or nearly 800,000 votes. Mastriano announced Wednesday that he would not run for governor again, telling supporters in a livestream with his wife Rebbie, that “God has not called us to run …  this year.”
State Treasurer Stacy Garrity is the likely 2026 Republican nominee to challenge Shapiro. Garrity, who called on state lawmakers to decertify the 2020 election results, is campaigning on her success in returning unclaimed money and property held by the state and her expansion of education savings accounts. 
But her campaign has also indicated that it plans to attack Shapiro on a Philadelphia stabbing case his office reviewed in 2018, when he was attorney general. Shapiro said his office reached the same conclusion as the Philadelphia medical examiner’s office, which has since walked back its conclusion that 27-year-old Ellen Greenburg’s death was suicide despite the finding of 27 stab wounds.
The Shapiro administration has failed to achieve some of the tentpole goals he talked about in the 2022 campaign, including school vouchers – a key goal of Republican lawmakers.

Good, a 37-year-old award-winning poet and mother, was shot and killed Wednesday. Her death has sparked national outrage, touching off protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country.
CCB Plaza in downtown Durham began to fill up with protesters just before dark. Many of them chanted protest slogans and carried signs condemning the shooting death of Good, as well as President Trump’s invasion of Venezuela and what they believe are the president’s attacks on democracy.
Sharon Jamison attended the rally to protest ICE, whom she contends is “kidnapping and murdering” people. Jamison said she hopes the protest in Durham and others across the country will eventually bring change.
“The hope is that over time, with enough protests, we can take momentum into the midterm elections and really flip things around and vote people out who are anti-democracy,” Jamison said. 
“She [Good] was a defender of immigrant rights. She was a mother,” said Alex Trejo, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation. “She was killed, murdered by an ICE agent named Jonathan Ross. The video evidence confirms this was a cold-blooded killing,” 
Trejo said any claim that Ross acted in self-defense is an “outrageous lie.” He said Democratic leaders must aggressively pursue justice.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has alleged Good refused a command to get out of her vehicle before she tried to run over and kill Ross. Noem contends Good committed an act of “domestic terrorism” and is backing Ross’ decision to shoot and kill her.
Noem’s account of the shooting has been disputed by Minneapolis officials and Gov. Tim Walz, as well as by many media organizations who have reviewed several videos of the encounter by observers and bystanders.
The shooting death in Minneapolis comes amid ramped up immigration enforcement actions in the city. The Trump administration has targeted Somali Americans, whom he has said are “destroying” the country. He has deployed 2,000 federal agents to the city in the wake of alleged fraud by members of the Somali community.  
North Carolina was also recently targeted by DHS for immigration enforcement, resulting in more than 100 arrests and sparking protests by immigrant advocates.
Poet Williams, director of Durham Beyond Policing, a grassroots campaign to divest from policing and prisons, said he has grown tired of law enforcement killings.
“It sickens me in the deepest part of my spirit each and every time one of us becomes a new hashtag or headline,” Williams said. “Where does the cycle end?",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_5194-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 21:57:46.646339

Nick Begich, R-Alaska, speaks during the commissioning ceremony for the Coast Guard icebreaker Storis on Sunday, Aug. 10, 2025, in Juneau, Alaska. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The U.S. House of Representatives voted 230-196 on Thursday to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years and reverse massive cost increases that went into effect with the new year.
The reversal must still be approved by the U.S. Senate and President Donald Trump before becoming effective.
Alaska’s lone member of the House, Republican Rep. Nick Begich III, voted against the extension, as did 195 other Republicans.
Seventeen Republicans voted for the extension of subsidies that were enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, joining all of the chamber’s Democrats. 
The House’s Republican leaders opposed the extension, but a handful of Republicans signed a petition in December to force a vote.
Begich did not sign that petition, and on Wednesday, he joined other Republicans in an unsuccessful procedural vote intended to block Thursday’s decision.
In a written statement explaining his vote on Thursday, Begich said extending subsidies would not fix the problems he sees with the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.  “The health insurance system created by Democrats under Obamacare has proven completely unaffordable for the American healthcare customer,” the statement said. “An extension of Obamacare COVID subsidies does not fix what is broken.”
He said he would like to see reforms to the Affordable Care Act, without which he said the extension “has no credible pathway forward in the Senate.”
In December, Begich voted in favor of a Republican-proposed alternative to the extension. That alternative, which focuses on drug costs, would not stop or reverse the new cost increases and has thus far been rejected by the Senate. 
The Congressional Budget Office reported that the alternative would reduce health insurance premiums for insured Americans but would also reduce the number of Americans who are insured. 
“I remain committed to working on reforms that lower costs, expand access, and improve outcomes for all Americans,” Begich said in his statement. “Temporary extensions without meaningful reform are not the solution. Real reform that puts patients first is.”
In December, Alaska’s two U.S. Senators, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan — both Republicans — joined Senate Democrats in an unsuccessful attempt to advance a condition-free extension similar to the one passed by the House on Thursday.
That was a change in position for Sullivan, who had previously opposed extensions that were not coupled with changes to the Affordable Care Act.
Begich and Sullivan are each up for election this fall. Sullivan does not have a Democratic Party-backed opponent yet, but former U.S. House Rep. Mary Peltola is widely expected to enter the race this month.
Begich is being opposed by Anchorage pastor Matt Schultz. Alaska Democratic Party Chair Eric Croft said by email that Thursday’s vote will be a campaign issue in the fall.
“After allowing lifesaving ACA tax credits to expire on December 31, Nick Begich doubled down on his betrayal of Alaska families and blocked the extension of these credits,” he wrote. “We cannot afford these health care price hikes, and we won’t forget about Nick Begich’s betrayal this November.”

The vigil in Hartford was taking place on the west side of the Abraham Ribicoff Court House on Main Street after 6 p.m. when the disruption occurred at the back of the court house, along South Prospect Street.
It is unclear who provoked the confrontation, but witnesses saw two vehicles, a gray sedan and a white van, emerge from the garage. A number of people got in front of the gray sedan, under the impression that a detainee was being taken away, witnesses said. The sedan pushed through the group. One woman was knocked over by the vehicle.
“I had to, like, pick her up to prevent her from getting run over,” Arjun Patel told the CT Mirror. 
One witness said they were pepper-sprayed by a masked person who had been behind the vehicle.

A white van with New Hampshire license plates then drove out of the garage. A protester threw an object at the van, which broke the left-rear window. The van stopped, shifted into reverse and accelerated, scattering some protesters, then drove north on Prospect Street.
At least half a dozen people were pepper-sprayed during the confrontation.
Attempts to reach federal officials with the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security were unsuccessful.

Good was shot and killed by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis on Wednesday. 
A Hartford Police official said agents with either ICE or Federal Protective Services, a law enforcement agency within DHS, were driving the vehicles. The official said the person knocked down by the vehicle declined medical treatment.
No one was arrested, he said.

Sally Grossman came to the vigil Thursday night from Windsor, expecting it to be peaceful. When she heard shouts from the other side of the building from protesters calling for support, she ran to help. She was standing in front of one of the vehicles when she was pepper-sprayed, she said.
Grossman said she was shocked at how the night turned out. “I brought my 8-year-old daughter with me, and my mom. I’ve never been to a violent protest at all,” she said, while struggling to keep her eyes open. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”
The vigil continued on the west side of the courthouse, where leaders of numerous civil rights groups gave speeches. Several hundred people attended the vigil.
Dan Piper, a teacher who spoke at the vigil, told those gathered that the federal officials are hoping to silence dissent. 
“Their only hope is that the most unspeakable brutality that they commit will scare us into going home and being quiet,” he said. “Will we rise to the challenge? I believe we will. You have convinced me we will, as have many millions across this country.”

Constanza Segovia, one of the leaders of Hartford Deportation Defense, was in the crowd and said that the death of Renee Good was terrifying and demonstrates the capacity of ICE to act violently. 
“I think something like this happening really calls for a clear decision from leaders. We are not where we’ve been,” she said.
Many of the event’s attendees were confused about — or ignorant of — what had occurred on the other side of the court house.
Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, attended the vigil and said he avoided the area where the confrontation happened with federal vehicles.
“I still don’t know a lot about what happened here tonight other than, obviously, there were some protesters who were looking to be more confrontational. But the vast majority of people here were looking to express their concerns peacefully,” he said. “I just don’t know yet what happened, and I don’t feel equipped to comment on it, but I hope everyone is safe.”

The move would concentrate more power over K-12 schools with the governor, who appoints the school board.","In summary
Newsom proposed shifting oversight of the Department of Education from the superintendent to the State Board of Education. The move would concentrate more power over K-12 schools with the governor, who appoints the school board. 


State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said he was blindsided by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal Thursday to curtail the superintendent’s duties and he disagrees with it, although it’s unclear what he can do to stop it.
“Tony Thurmond is proud and grateful to work with Gov. Newsom. They’re both champions of public education,” said Elizabeth Sanders, spokeswoman for the California Department of Education, which Thurmond heads. Sanders was speaking on behalf of the superintendent.
“Unfortunately, on this particular issue they are not aligned.”
In his State of the State address on Thursday, Newsom proposed shifting oversight of the Department of Education, a 2,000-employee state agency, from the superintendent to the State Board of Education. The move would concentrate more power over K-12 schools with the governor, who appoints the school board. 
The superintendent would remain an elected position, but with diminished and less defined duties. 
Referencing a December report from Policy Analysis for California Education, Newsom’s aim is to simplify California’s convoluted system of K-12 school governance. Currently, education leadership comes from the governor, the Legislature, the State Board of Education, the superintendent and the Department of Education — who may or may not have the same vision for how to best run schools and teach children. At the local level, school boards and county offices of education also have a good deal of power over budgets and day-to-day school operations.
The result of the many-headed leadership structure is that schools often don’t know which policies to follow, according to the PACE report. Guidelines can be contradictory, redundant or just plain incoherent, researchers found.
A slew of education advocacy groups have supported Newsom’s proposal, saying it will clarify a system that’s been confusing and inefficient for a century. California is one of only a handful of states with such an education governance model.
‘Unnecessary disruption’
Thurmond’s staff had a few hints that an announcement might be forthcoming, but otherwise was caught off guard by Newsom’s proposal, Sanders said. They also hadn’t talked to PACE researchers about their report.
Thurmond questions the point of the change, Sanders said.
“It’s unclear how this would benefit students and families,” Sanders said. “It’s an unnecessary disruption. … We should be staying focused on creating results for students.”
If the governor really wanted to help schools, he should pour more money into K-12 education. The Department of Education has been underfunded for years, she noted, and schools could use more funds for initiatives like tutoring and mandatory kindergarten.
John Affeldt, managing attorney at Public Advocates, a nonprofit law firm focused on education, also questioned the value of Newsom’s proposal. It would take power away from the voters and give it to the governor, which might be great if the governor supports public education but may backfire if a governor doesn’t, he said.
“It might improve the governance structure a bit, but I’m not sure it’s worth the tradeoff,” Affeldt said. “It might be a lot of political theater for not much real change.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/100425_Gov-Candidate-Forum_ZM_CM_12.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 20:57:13.205075

Less than 48 hours after the Montana Supreme Court stopped a first-of-its-kind constitutional measure that would prohibit corporations from spending money on political candidates or ballot issues, the Transparent Election Initiative in Montana resubmitted a revised proposal that its leaders said honored the court’s ruling and simplified the motion.
The organization also submitted a similar measure for a statutory initiative, which wasn’t originally part of what the group calls “The Montana Plan,” but will be done to ensure Montanans can vote on the concept in the November election.
A constitutional ballot initiative that receives a majority of votes would change the Montana Constitution while an initiative would modify state statute. Montana voters can propose and vote on laws except those which appropriate money, a power reserved only to the Legislature.
Transparent Election Initiative leader Jeff Mangan, who was formerly the Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, said he still prefers the constitutional initiative because it would establish the concept in the highest law in the state. However, because the time for signature gathering is narrowing, the initiative process that would amend state law is also an alternative he wants to keep available, because the threshold is lower.
On Tuesday, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that the original proposal submitted by TEI violated a constitutional rule that limits a ballot initiative to a single-subject. A unanimous Supreme Court said that the measure contained several provisions that could be seen as reaching into more than just money in politics and corporate spending powers.
Mangan told the Daily Montanan on Thursday, after the newly reformulated documents were submitted to the Montana Secretary of State, that he took the court’s advice to heart and simplified the measure.
Previously, the initiative curtailed corporate spending in politics by revoking corporations’ powers granted by the state, then reinstating them, but excluding the power to spend on political campaigns.
Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, had successfully argued to the state’s highest court that the provision contained more than a single-subject — an argument with which the court agreed.
Now, the summary text of the measures makes clear that artificial persons and corporations do not have “political spending power.” Meanwhile, it says that political committees and “natural persons” can still spend money on politics. It also specifies that if a state-chartered business would spend politically, those corporations could lose limited liability status and be subject to punishment.
Mangan said this modification helps simplify the measure, clarifying that corporations cannot spend money on politics without risking losing the power to do business in Montana or fines.
Montana has been a historical leader in trying to curb the power of corporations and their ability to spend money in elections for more than a century. Lawmakers, voters and courts wrestled with the issue before the passage of the Corrupt Practices Act in 1912, which began a history of chasing corporate money from Treasure State politics. Montana’s efforts also were key in the controversial “Citizens United” ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said that corporations were artificial persons and entitled to spend money on political campaigns because that act is an expression of free speech and association. Montana argued that its law that stated corporations were not people, I-166, was legal and necessary given the state’s history — an argument that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected in a split decision.
The Transparent Election Initiative is taking a new, different tact: It’s targeting corporations through their charters. Because companies and corporations must be granted charters, or legal status by the state, they must comply with state laws regarding how business is conducted. This measure would limit those corporate rights to operate and bar political spending.
Mangan told the Daily Montanan that his previous attempt to craft ballot language may have been a case of wanting to “cross every T and dot every I” to ensure it was complete and would pass muster, but the effort may have been too complicated. Instead, the new proposals simplify and condense the aims, he said.
The organization also submitted a statutory initiative along with the constitutional issue to the state. He said that’s because of the time it will likely take for the review process at the Secretary of State’s Office as well as a required review at the Montana Attorney General’s Office. Those processes, and any legal challenges that follow, will continue to shorten the window for signature collecting. Both initiative and constitutional ballot would need to have enough signatures submitted to the state by June 19 in order to make the November election.
For constitutional ballots, Montana requires “the petition must be signed by at least 10%  of the qualified electors in the state at large, including at 10% in each of at least two-fifths (40) of the legislative districts,” according to Montana law.
For statutory initiatives, Montana requires a lower threshold: “At least 5% of the qualified electors in each of at least one-third of the legislative representative districts (34)  and the total number of signers must be at least 5% of the total qualified electors of the state.”
“Everywhere I go around the state, people just want their elections back,” Mangan said. “Montanans deserve a fair shot at voting on whether corporations should be allowed to dominate our political process. Today’s filings provide a pathway.”

Federal agents reportedly shot and injured two people in east Portland on Thursday afternoon, according to the Portland Police Bureau.
Police had few immediate details to share about the incident, which occurred the day after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis.
Like Minneapolis, Oregon’s largest city has been the subject of an intense immigration crackdown by federal agents in recent months. While a federal judge stymied President Donald Trump’s efforts to mobilize the Oregon National Guard and deploy guardsmen from other states to Portland, federal officials revealed in court in December that they’ve brought ICE agents from around the country to the metro as part of a major operation.
“We are still in the early stages of this incident,” Portland Police Chief Bob Day said in a statement. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more.”
Police received reports of a shooting on the 10200 block of Southeast Main Street at 2:18 p.m. Six minutes later, they received a call for help from a man at Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside, a few blocks away.
They found a man and woman with apparent gunshot wounds. Emergency responders transported both people to the hospital and their condition is unknown, according to police.
Portland Mayor Keith Wilson called on ICE to immediately pause its operations in Portland and urged residents to remain calm.
“We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts. Portland is not a ‘training ground’ for militarized agents, and the ‘full force’ threatened by the administration has deadly consequences,” Wilson said. “As mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.”
U.S. Rep. Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents Portland, also urged her constituents to stay calm and said local law enforcement must be able to conduct a full investigation.
“ICE has done nothing but inject terror, chaos, and cruelty into our communities,” Dexter said. “Trump’s immigration machine is using violence to control our communities—straight out of the authoritarian playbook. ICE must immediately end all active operations in Portland.”
Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, added that he was monitoring reports, and that “Trump’s deployment of federal agents in my hometown is clearly inflaming violence — and must end.”

Nevada originally won early approval for the state’s internet deployment plan in January 2025 through the Biden administration, but by June the Trump administration rescinded approval of Nevada’s plan, along with plans from Louisiana and Delaware, which had also received early approval.
The Trump administration issued new guidance for spending the federal funding, ordering states to focus more on satellite providers and less on fiber optics, and to spend less overall.
Nevada filed its final Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) proposal to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in September last year, which has now been approved according to the governor’s office. 
“A commitment was made to connect every Nevadan to reliable, high-speed internet, and it remains one of my top priorities. With this final approval from the NTIA, I am proud to announce that we are delivering on that promise,” said Gov. Joe Lombardo in a statement.
The approval will unlock more than $170 million of Nevada’s $416 million total BEAD allocation for projects across the state as part of the High-Speed Nevada Initiative’s third phase. Deployment of BEAD projects is expected to begin in mid-2026 with construction of various projects happening over the next four years. 
The High-Speed Nevada Initiative will connect reliable high-speed internet to underserved rural communities throughout the state using a mix of technologies, including fiber-optic, hybrid-fiber-coax, licensed fixed wireless, and satellite broadband, said the governor’s office.
The Governor’s Office of Science, Innovation and Technology (OSIT), said they also plan to leverage more than $65 million in private sector investments as part of the BEAD deployment. 
“I am proud of the work our team has done, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring affordable, reliable high-speed internet is accessible to all Nevadans, regardless of where they live. With NTIA approval of Nevada’s BEAD proposal, we are now one step closer to deployment and realizing our goals,” d Britta Appel, Director of OSIT.

Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, announces his 2026 campaign for governor during an event on June 30, 2025, at the David Lust Accelerator Building in Rapid City. (Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Republican governor candidate Dusty Johnson wants to give first-time homebuyers two years without property taxes and also wants to provide $400 annual property tax credits to all other homeowners in the state, he announced Thursday.
“Property taxes have become a problem for every South Dakota homeowner, and I feel duty-bound to provide relief to all of them,” Johnson said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight.
Johnson is serving the remainder of his term in the U.S. House while he seeks the Republican nomination for governor in June’s primary election. His proposal comes as lawmakers prepare to debate a heap of other property tax ideas during the legislative session that begins Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre.
Homeowners’ property tax payments rose nearly 40% from 2020 to 2024, causing many to demand relief.

Johnson would pay for his proposal with $110 million in estimated annual revenue that will be available when the state sales tax rate goes back to 4.5%. Lawmakers reduced it to 4.2% in 2023 but scheduled the reduction to sunset after June 30, 2027.
“It’s important that the relief is fiscally responsible,” Johnson said. “There are a lot of plans out there. There are a lot of people promising the moon, but they can’t actually make the math work.”
Johnson said each homeowner would see the credit on their county property tax statement.
Johnson’s campaign said there are about 260,000 homeowner-occupied parcels in South Dakota, making a $400 credit for each come to about $104 million. The campaign said there are about 1,500 first-time homeowners every year who pay an average of $2,000 in property taxes, which comes to $3 million annually, or $6 million for the first two years.
Among the other property tax relief ideas that could be considered by lawmakers this winter are 19 proposed by a task force over the summer.
Hansen: Johnson tries to ‘take credit for others’ plans’
State House Speaker Jon Hansen, of Dell Rapids, served on the task force and is seeking the Republican nomination for governor. He accused Johnson of stealing the sales tax idea from the task force.
One of the task force recommendations, from Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, would capture the revenue from the scheduled sales tax increase and place it in a “local effort replacement fund” to replace a portion of property taxes paid to school districts. The recommendation does not specify a plan for $400 credits or a two-year property tax holiday for first-time homebuyers.
Hansen also pointed to a social media post of his from Nov. 3 when he proposed the “preservation of $105 million in sales tax relief dedicated to property tax cuts.”
“Dusty Johnson can try to take credit for others’ plans all day, but the reality is he didn’t do the work to create this plan,” Hansen said in a statement. “This proposal was adopted by the property tax task force this summer, which I created and helped lead. Over two months ago I announced this proposal as just one aspect of a larger plan to significantly reduce property taxes. A vote on this plan is already coming this legislative session.”

Hansen has also endorsed taking money from a state housing infrastructure fund and state reserve funds to provide $120 million of property tax relief to homeowners through $500 credits; cutting state spending by 5% and using the $123 million of savings for property tax cuts; and dedicating 25% of future state revenue growth to property tax relief.
Another Republican candidate for governor, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, said Johnson’s plan “does nothing to actually confront the problems negatively impacting South Dakota.”
“Shifting from one tax to another doesn’t alleviate the burden on residents. It makes it worse,” Doeden said. “The state should be seeking to lower the tax burden on South Dakota families, not create an increase.”
Doeden has pledged to eliminate property taxes by utilizing savings from the creation of a state Department of Government Efficiency, by implementing “more fair and equitable” ways to generate revenue, and by growing the economy to widen the tax base.
Gov. Rhoden supports optional county sales tax
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden is serving the remainder of former Gov. Kristi Noem’s term after she departed to serve in the Trump Cabinet. Rhoden is also running to keep his job, and has already signed one property tax relief proposal into law after legislators approved it in March.
The multifaceted law, which took effect in July, is intended to slow property tax increases. It places tighter limits on the growth of property assessments and local government budgets for five years, exempts some home improvements from affecting assessments, and makes more elderly and disabled people eligible for property tax assessment freezes by raising limits on their income and home values.
Governor: ‘Not much I’ve seen that I could support’ in legislative property tax proposals

Rhoden has additionally proposed an optional half-percent sales tax for counties, which they could use to reduce the county portion of owner-occupied property taxes on homes. Counties are not currently allowed to levy sales taxes.
Rhoden said Thursday in a statement that “South Dakotans deserve a meaningful property tax cut, and my plan delivers it.”
“A blanket statewide sales tax increase delivers less relief for the South Dakota communities who need it most,” Rhoden said. “My plan empowers voters in each county to make their own decisions, and to deliver a bigger property tax cut for homeowners if they choose.”
County commissioners could impose Rhoden’s proposed county sales tax, and citizens could gather petition signatures to send the decision to local voters.
Johnson said Rhoden’s plan “passes the buck” to county commissions. He also said it could transfer tax benefits from rural counties to urban counties, pointing to greater taxable sales in larger cities.
South Dakota Searchlight asked Johnson to square his property tax proposal with his earlier pledge to make schools the state’s top budget priority. He said long-term school funding depends on economic growth, and lower homeownership costs would help achieve that goal.
Johnson said homeowners who already qualify for state relief programs, such as elderly and disabled people, would still get the $400 credit.

Brad Little to navigate revenue shortfalls and pass a balanced budget.

Setting a revenue projection is an important step in the annual budget setting process legislators undertake because the Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from running a deficit where expenses exceed revenues. Without a revenue projection, legislators don’t have a clear estimate of how much money the state can afford to spend while setting state agency budgets.
“We’re going to try to tackle the revenue projection right away,” Senate President Pro Tem Kelly Anthon, R-Rupert, said Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
 Last year, legislators waited to set revenue projection until late in the session

But last year, legislators did not set an official revenue projection to base the state budget around until March 5, which was 59 days into the legislative session. By that point, legislators had already passed major tax cuts and set major budgets before they set the revenue projection – a move that was criticized by some members of both political parties. 
But Anthon – the top ranking Republican in the Idaho Senate – said legislative leaders don’t want to wait that long during the 2026 Idaho legislative session, which begins Monday. 
“We’ve decided, as majority leadership, to try to do a better job this session (by) really hitting the revenue projection early and to work better with the governor’s office to try to get to that revenue number quickly,” Anthon said. “We’ll see how that goes, but that is the goal.”
Balancing and setting the state budget is likely to be one of the top issues during the 2026 legislative session. 
For years, Idaho has enjoyed consecutive budget surpluses as high as $2 billion.
But after five years of the Idaho Legislature passing income tax cuts that reduced state revenue by up to $4 billion, Idaho is facing projected budget deficits in the current fiscal year 2026 and next year in fiscal year 2027.
The latest projection for the current year projects a state budget deficit of $40.3 million. 
For fiscal year 2027, one state estimate projected a state budget deficit of $555.2 million. 
Those projections do not include the added cost of complying with federal tax changes championed by President Donald Trump in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which would reduce state revenue even further if adopted at the state level.
During a press conference with reporters on Thursday, Little offered a preview of the annual State of the State address, which he will deliver Monday during the first day of the 2026 legislative session. 
Little told reporters he will propose a balanced state budget, and he has committed to Trump that Idaho will conform with the tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act – changes that include no tax on overtime pay or tips for workers, an expanded deduction for seniors and no tax on borrowers’ car loan interest. 
“There is one new pledge I’ll give you right now – we are going to propose a balanced budget,” Little said. 
“I did commit to the president when I met with him that we were going to implement compliance (with the Big Beautiful Bill’s tax changes), and so that’s kind of where I’m coming from,” Little added.
 Idaho governor says he is not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion

While House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said earlier this week he is open to the idea of repealing Medicaid expansion as a tool to reduce state spending, Little told reporters Thursday that he is not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion.
Little cautioned against repealing Medicaid expansion, which more than 60% of Idaho voters approved in the 2018 general election. Little said there would be unintended consequences to repealing Medicaid expansion and said the state took away some of the safety nets that had been in place prior to Medicaid expansion, including the Catastrophic Health Care Fund, or CAT Fund, that provided care for indigent patients with no other health coverage.

“If you look at Medicaid, there’s all kinds of unintended consequences,” Little said. “The raw number for repeal is not the actual number, and the Department of Health Welfare is working on that.”
When asked, Little stopped short of saying he would veto a bill seeking to repeal Medicaid expansion. Instead, Little said he doesn’t comment on what he will do with bills before they arrive on his desk. 
While Little said he was not looking to repeal Medicaid expansion, House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said she is still deeply concerned about the impact of the budget cuts Idaho legislators will make to balance the budget. 
“We are in a hole,” Rubel said. “There’s no question about it. We are $555 million below what we need to cover the most basic maintenance budgets to keep the lights on in our agencies.”
Rubel said Idaho has a self-inflicted revenue problem, not a spending problem. Rubel urged Little and the Idaho Legislature to balance the budget by increasing revenue through repealing last year’s income tax cuts and the passage of the new education tax credit, which reimburses families for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools. 
“We don’t have a spending problem,” Rubel said. “There is no fat to cut. In fact, we already fund things at such an incredibly low level that it’s costly in and of itself.”
On Thursday, Little did not reveal any of the specific budget initiatives or cost-cutting measures he will recommend to the Idaho Legislature. Instead Little asked Idahoans to wait for Monday’s State of the State address, when he said he will unveil his proposals. 
Little is scheduled to deliver the address to the Idaho Legislature at 1 p.m. Mountain time Monday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. The address will be streamed live online, for free, via the Idaho in Session service.

Palestinians have the right to exist, return, thrive and live with full human dignity.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Stevie Paquette: When ethics are questioned, Vermonters deserve answers — not sponsored narratives.","This commentary is by Stevie Paquette, a Colchester resident pursuing a master’s degree in social work, with an interest in ethics, human rights and Palestinian self-determination. 



I am writing this as a Vermonter, a constituent and someone who is openly anti-Zionist and believes in the legitimacy and self-determination of the Palestinian people. I also believe deeply in ethical, transparent government and public accountability. 
When a number of local lawmakers traveled to Israel on an all-expenses-paid trip arranged by foreign political organizations — not to mention an organization that has been accused by the UN of actively committing genocide — I reached out to my representatives with what I thought were reasonable questions. I didn’t demand outrage or resignations. I asked for some transparency. 
Who paid for this trip? Who determined what our elected officials would see? And not see? What political organization curated this experience? Whose perspectives were intentionally excluded in this trip?
I emailed five representatives. One responded. The reply from Rep. Sarita Austin, D-Colchester, was polite, but it largely shifted the conversation away from ethics and toward reminders about Hamas, personal reflections, a ChatGPT-generated history timeline and talking points about coexistence. My main concern — whether our lawmakers should be accepting foreign sponsored political travel at all — went unaddressed. 
Meanwhile, these legislators have continued either to publicly defend the trip or completely ignore calls for answers, acting as if this questioning is somehow out of bounds. 
With renewed reporting and formal ethics complaints now filed, I am reminded that these questions are not extreme. They were necessary. 
This is not about choosing sides in a geopolitical conflict with deep historical roots. It is entirely possible, and I believe morally necessary, to condemn the violence of Hamas, acknowledge the grief and fear experienced by Israelis and still question whether elected officials should travel on trips curated and funded by organizations aligned with a government accused of serious, ongoing human rights violations. 
Those things are not mutually exclusive. 
The concern is about influence, not tourism. 
Sponsored political trips exist because they work. They are designed to create warm positive impressions, establish relationships and loyalty and to take control and frame reality through their own lens. They shape what is seen as “normal” or “inevitable” or “reasonable.” 
When lawmakers accept those invitations, it creates at minimum the appearance of undue influence and at worst risks normalizing and spreading propaganda. 
It also sends a stark and painful message to Vermonters, especially Palestinian Vermonters and those who stand with them, that our government is comfortable participating in experiences curated by the very institutions accused of their oppression. 
To raise these concerns is not antisemitic. It is not anti-Jewish. It is not even anti-Israel. It is simply ethical citizenship. 
And, honestly, transparency should not be this controversial. 
At a minimum, Vermonters should be able to expect full disclosure of who is funding travel, public itineraries, identification of the organizations arranging the meetings and clarity about the political aims of the trip’s sponsors. 
These are basic standards, in many states required, and Vermont should be stronger, not weaker, on ethics. 
When I wrote my representatives, I was not asking them to agree with my politics. I was asking them to model accountability. Instead, I received deflection and silence. 
We deserve better. 
I am anti-Zionist because I believe oppression cannot be justified by fear, history or identity. Palestinians have the right to exist, return, thrive and live with full human dignity. That doesn’t make me naïve, dangerous or unreasonable. It’s pretty simple to place human rights over nationalism. And that principle should be guiding our legislators’ ethics. 
Lawmakers should not be accepting curated, paid-for political travel from any foreign government or advocacy network, regardless of ideology. Not from Israel. Not from anyone. 
If legislators believe such trips are appropriate, then they should be willing and ready to answer, plainly, why and be transparent on details. 
Until then, Vermonters will continue to raise these questions. And we should.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)A top adviser to Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson is back at work with a new title and portfolio.
Sahar Fathi, Ferguson’s policy director when she went on a six-month leave July 1, is returning to a newly created post of chief impact officer. Fathi will report directly to Ferguson and remain a member of his executive leadership team. She had reported to the chief of staff.
Fathi’s focus will be on developing “progressive policy solutions” and she will serve as the primary contact with community organizations and local government leaders. She will also supervise the federal policy team, according to the governor’s office.
“This new role will allow Sahar to focus on progressive, proactive policy work, in direct partnership with community and elected leaders,” Ferguson said in a statement Thursday.
Kenneth Martin, interim policy director during Fathi’s absence, will succeed her in that post.
“I believe policy is a powerful tool in the governor’s mission to make government center the people,” Fathi said in a statement issued by the governor’s office. “That means all the people — especially those who have historically been left behind, and those targeted by the Trump administration. Creating a leadership position explicitly focused on this goal is exactly the kind of innovation that makes me excited to be part of his administration.”
Fathi served as Ferguson’s policy director when he was the state’s attorney general. She was one of the first people he hired after getting elected governor in November 2024. 
As policy director, she oversaw a 20-person staff responsible for developing policy initiatives in support of Ferguson’s agenda.
Her lengthy resume of public service includes working for King County, the Seattle Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs and as a legislative aide to former Seattle City Council member Mike O’Brien, according to online biographies. In 2013, Fathi made The Stranger’s list of The Smartest People in Seattle Politics. 
Martin served as deputy policy director for issues related to the environment, transportation and infrastructure until filling in for Fathi. He led the American Indian Environmental Office in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden and served as deputy assistant secretary for tribal government affairs in the U.S. Department of Transportation under President Barack Obama.
Ferguson’s communications office declined to share Fathi’s salary for the newly created position. She earned $195,000 a year as policy director, according to public records obtained by The Standard. The governor’s office also did not share Martin’s salary.
With Thursday’s announcements, Ferguson will have new leaders in place for his legislative and policy shops when lawmakers return for the 2026 session that begins Monday.
In May, Ferguson named Debbie Driver as legislative director. She served as a transportation policy advisor to former Gov. Jay Inslee and also worked as an analyst with the state House of Representatives. 
She replaced Joyce Bruce, who resigned in March, not long after her deputy, Shawn Lewis, had quit. That left the governor without a legislative team in the final stretch of his first legislative session.
At the time, the governor’s policy team absorbed the legislative work and Fathi served as the primary contact for legislative leadership.
Ferguson cited the added chores when Fathi, whom he said had been “a crucial member” of his team since 2019, took leave.
“After six years and a particularly intense legislative session, in which she took on more than one full-time job, she’s taking a break,” he said.
Meanwhile, Ferguson will be losing a member of his cabinet this month as Joe Nguyen is leaving as director of Washington state’s Department of Commerce to become the new leader of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber. 
Ferguson has not announced who will fill that spot.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/governors-office-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 19:12:29.541653

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)A Henderson man who threw his girlfriend’s three month-old kitten against a wall and then into a parking lot and sent the video to her in an alleged attempt to intimidate her, must stay away from his girlfriend, guns, and “any animals, whatsoever” as his case proceeds, Henderson Justice of the Peace Barbara Schifalacqua ordered Thursday. 
“The court has real concern because of not only the threats made but the video sent in this matter,” Schifalacqua said to Angel Ventura Ayala, who appeared for the hearing via Zoom. Ayala posted bail shortly after his arrest Dec. 16. 
Court records indicate Ayala is charged with one felony count of domestic violence abuse with a deadly weapon and two felony counts of animal abuse with the intent to threaten or terrorize an individual. Reba’s Law, passed last year by the Nevada Legislature, increases the penalty for animal abuse that is intended to threaten or intimidate. 
 An incident report filed by Henderson Police says Ayala, 27, was mad at his girlfriend, 19 year-old Sienna Aldabbagh, and sent her a video of himself throwing the cat. 
Ayala, according to the incident report, can be heard on the video saying “‘you got this, right’ as he is picking up the cat as though he was making sure that the subject was recording. He then says ‘I’ll throw your bitch ass cat’… As Angel walked down the breezeway, he violently threw Suki (the kitten) against the wall toward the parking lot. Angel then picked up the cat a second time and threw it into the parking lot. The cat could be heard crying during the second throw.”
The report states that while Aldabbagh was searching for the kitten near Ayala’s apartment, “Angel pulled a gun from his waistband, racked a round and threatened her with it.” 
The video on social media quickly drew the attention of animal advocates. 
“The links between domestic violence and animal abuse are well-documented and apparent in this case,” Gina Greisen of Nevada Voters for Animals, one of several activists who notified police of the allegation, said Thursday. “We’re having a rash of animal cruelty cases, and we are among the worst states in the nation for domestic violence.”  
The cat, which was treated by a veterinarian for minor injuries, was turned over to Henderson Animal Shelter, according to the police report. It’s unknown whether the cat has been retrieved from the shelter. 
Ayala’s preliminary hearing is scheduled for Feb. 11. His attorney had no comment on the case.
The case is among the first to test Reba’s Law, passed by lawmakers last year after homeless individuals discovered a French bulldog abandoned in a sealed plastic tote in the summer heat behind a commercial building in 2024. The dog died days later. 
Following the arrest of suspects in Reba’s death, Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said he’d been besieged by citizens calling for stiffer penalties for animal abuse. However, the Current’s review of cases prosecuted by Wolfson revealed the DA rarely sought to impose prison time for offenders. 
Days after Gov. Joe Lombardo signed Reba’s Law, Wolfson cut a plea deal with one of the defendants charged in Reba’s case. 
“O.K. Wolfson, you asked for a new law. Now you’ve got it. What are you going to do with it?” Greisen asked rhetorically. 
The new law increases willful animal abuse or neglect that results in death from a category D felony, punishable by up to four years in prison, to a category B felony, punishable by a minimum of one year and up to six years in prison. It also renders animal abuse or neglect that is intended to threaten, intimidate, or terrorize an individual as a category B felony, also punishable by up to six years behind bars. 
“Is this going to be another case of our weak and ineffective judicial system telling the perpetrator to ‘never do this again,’ receive some sort of probation and/or pay an insignificant fine?” Boulder City resident Fred Voltz said via email of the case involving the cat. “These cases will continue to occur unless the same significant penalties for assault and battery apply to any animal as it would to any human adult or child.”
Animal activists say they are also frustrated by what they call a lack of awareness by law enforcement regarding the provisions of Reba’s Law. 
At a community gathering Tuesday in Summerlin, organized by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police to educate the public about the provisions of Reba’s Law, Det. Nancy Leyva, one of two detectives assigned to animal abuse and neglect cases, stated the law increased the penalty for abuse or neglect resulting in death to 10 years, and said an individual who fails to take action to prevent the malicious act is subject to the same penalty. 
However, both provisions – the 10 year maximum penalty and the effort to hold accountable an individual who fails to act – were removed from the bill following concerns voiced by the American Civil Liberties Union and others. 
Leyva referred the Current to Metro’s public information office, which did not respond.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image-1-8-26-at-4.01 PM-1024x627.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:12:29.541653

(Photo by Bruce Bennett/Getty Images)A plan to expand New Jersey’s corporate tax breaks by billions and grant Newark’s Prudential Center new tax subsidies cleared another hurdle Thursday on its gallop to the governor’s desk.
The Senate’s budget and appropriations committee unanimously approved a bill that still needs to pass both full chambers by Tuesday, when the current two-year legislative session ends, to become law.
The bill advanced despite objections from critics who said raising the state’s current cap on corporate tax credits from $11.5 billion to $14.3 billion, as the bill proposes, is “reckless” during a time of worsening budget constraints.
Peter Chen, a senior policy analyst with New Jersey Policy Perspective, predicted people and community groups around the state would be stiffed in favor of “billionaire sports owners.”
“They are going to be told: ‘Sorry, there’s no money. Sorry, we only have this much for you this year.’ But now, when it comes to raise the cap on corporate subsidies, suddenly checkbooks open, right? Suddenly, it’s: ‘OK, let’s raise the $3 billion’ in the blink of an eye,” Chen said.
Dena Mottola Jaborska, executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, urged lawmakers to direct the state Economic Development Authority to show evidence of any benefits such subsidies have generated for the state in the past five years before doling out more.
But Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex), a committee member and the bill’s prime sponsor, bristled at the criticism and called the bill necessary for Newark, which is in her legislative district.

“People throughout this state have tropes and stereotypes about the district that I represent. When they come down to the Pru Center for a hockey game or for a mega concert or for some other kind of venue, perhaps in those four hours that they’re down there, they realize the greatness of our great city,” Ruiz said.
Jake Reynolds, who’s president of both the center and the New Jersey Devils, who play there, told lawmakers the facility needs $400 million in repairs and renovations, and the new subsidies would help fund them.

Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) looks on. (Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)Baltimore area officials still want to create some kind of regional body to oversee the area’s water system — just don’t call it a regional water authority.
During the introductory meeting Wednesday of a new work group discussing the matter, Baltimore Comptroller Bill Henry (D), the work group’s chairman, said that a regional water authority is officially off the table.
“That path has since proved prohibitive from several financial and legal perspectives,” Henry said. “Instead, our focus here over the course of the next year will be much more practical, and — hopefully — more achievable.”
During a previous task force convened to discuss the water system — which is largely owned by Baltimore City but serves Baltimore County and other neighboring jurisdictions — officials looked closely at a water authority.
But they discovered several problems that would arise from creating a new, regional entity to handle day-to-day operations for the system, as opposed to Baltimore’s Department of Public Works, which largely runs the system today.
For one thing, the existing debt incurred by the city to run the system would have to be transferred to that new entity, and because much of that debt was incurred when interest rates were substantially lower, doing so would come at an immense cost.

Creating a new entity would also impact employees, who would essentially transfer to a new employer, even if their jobs remained the same. And it would force pension obligations to be relocated as well.
So, Henry says he envisions a new governance structure whereby the city agency would still handle the operations of the system, but it would ultimately answer to a board of officials from around the region, instead of simply Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D).
“Right now, DPW just works for the mayor of Baltimore, right? And the director of DPW does what the mayor says,” Henry said in an interview. “What is on the table to change is: The director would do what this regional entity says they should do.”
It remains to be seen precisely what form the new body could take. The new work group is specifically tasked with evaluating whether a “Rate Board,” tasked only with setting utility bills for water, sewer and stormwater, would be a good fit for the region. Currently, much of that power sits with Baltimore’s Board of Estimates.
There is also likely to be significant political grappling over how such a board might be composed, and how many representatives would come from the city, versus the surrounding counties or other entities.
Per a recently released schedule, the new work group plans to release its final report by the end of this year.
The 13-member Baltimore Regional Water Governance Model Work Group is the second cohort to consider Baltimore’s water system over the past several years. Under a 2024 state law, Scott selects five of the 13 members, with three appointed by the Baltimore County executive, two by the governor, one each by the Maryland Senate president and House speaker, and one from Anne Arundel, Carroll, Harford or Howard counties.
The work group’s decision could cap years of tension between city and county about the control of the water system. Infrastructure woes and billing issues have stirred the pot in recent years, but demographic change also lies at the heart of the matter.
The system was constructed by a far larger Baltimore City, which agreed to expand it outward to service Baltimore County as that jurisdiction grew, and to serve other counties, though to a lesser extent. Today, the size of the county far surpasses that of the city, but the city maintains much of the control.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Environmental and ratepayer advocacy groups have previously expressed concern that, even though the city and counties have cost-sharing agreements, city residents bear too much of the cost, and expressed worry that a regional water authority could seize assets from the city, leaving it worse off financially.
So Jorge Aguilar, southern region director at Food and Water Watch, said he was heartened to learn Wednesday that a regional water authority wasn’t in the cards for Baltimore.
“Based on those findings for the first task force on this issue, it was estimated that the creation of the new authority could result in more than $2 billion in transaction costs and could lead to large water bill hikes, water shut offs, privatization, loss of potential unionized positions within the city and within the county government. So again, really glad that is off the table,” Aguilar said.
“We really do hope that the outcome of your deliberations will be to ensure more equity in the cost allocations between the city and the county, while protecting and expanding local control, union jobs and water affordability,” Aguilar said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC09916-1024x622.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque) introduced three medical compact bills ahead of the legislative session, saying the state’s healthcare worker shortage requires the Legislature to enter more than just compacts for doctors and social workers. (Courtesy NM Legislature) After weeks of bipartisan negotiations, state lawmakers this week unveiled legislation intended to make it easier for doctors to practice in New Mexico by entering a multistate medical compact for physicians.
Advocates have lobbied for years that entering the compact — which would allow doctors licensed in other states to practice in New Mexico — will help address the state’s physician shortage, but have faced pushback from some Democratic lawmakers. 
Now one lawmaker from the working group on the issue, Rep. Marian Matthews (D-Albuquerque), said the proposals intended for this session don’t go far enough.
This week, she introduced three bills that would enter the state into three additional health care compacts and is urging her colleagues to at least consider them.
New Mexico Senate majority leader says medical compact legislation ‘close’ ahead of session

“Our health system is in really bad shape right now,” she told Source NM. “I can’t think of a higher priority for us in the coming session but to address solutions to the problem, and compacts are a part of that.” 
Unlike 44 jurisdictions, including New Mexico’s five border states, New Mexico is neither a member of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact for physicians, nor part of eight other major compacts for paramedics, audiologists, dentists and other specialties, according to Think New Mexico, a nonpartisan advocacy group. 
In response to ongoing pressure from advocates and state Republican lawmakers to allow medical compact legislation a full hearing at the Roundhouse, Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth (D-Santa Fe) in November convened a six-lawmaker working group composed of Democrats and Republicans in both chambers. 
Members were tasked with crafting legislation that would enter the state into health care licensure compacts amid public outcry over growing wait lists and long drives to access health care across the state. The state lost close to 250 doctors between 2019 and 2024.
Wirth told Source New Mexico that the group, after multiple meetings, succeeded in crafting licensure compact legislation for doctors and social workers, but that other potential compacts need more work and remain “in the pipeline.” Lawmakers are expected to introduce the social worker compact legislation soon.
Wirth has previously described joining compacts as a complex process that requires lawmakers to work closely with managers of each of the licensure organizations individually to ensure legislation meets their requirements but also ensures the state maintains its autonomy. 
But Matthews said she emerged from the working group convinced that joining the compacts is relatively easy and that reconciling the state’s legislation with compact requirements is often a matter of “stylistic” versus “substantive” changes. 
She also is increasingly persuaded the compacts work. She provided Source a list of studies that show immediate increases in health care workers for states that join compacts.
NM Senate Dems unlikely to move on medical compacts for special session

Matthews said she faced pushback in the working group about introducing additional compact bills, but decided, “We need to move forward on this.”
Her legislation would enter New Mexico into compacts for paramedics, counselors and psychologists. 
She told Source she is actively working with managers for each of those compacts, sharing the legislation and seeking assurances that the language meets their requirements. She expects to amend each bill soon after the session starts with any additional notes they provide, she told Source.
Still, Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe), one of the sponsors for the physician compact bill, told Source this week that she doesn’t think the Legislature will have enough time to carefully consider each of Matthews’ compacts.
As evidence, she pointed to the amount of work the doctor compact took, saying the lawmakers and compact managers had to toil over language about, for example, liability for compact board members; the state Medical Board’s subpoena power; and protection of health records, particularly for women and transgender people. Doing that for three other compacts during a 30-day session would be impossible, she said. 
“They’re not ready,” she said of Matthews’ compacts. “We have not had any comprehensive meetings with the organizations on that to make sure that any changes that we make will be accepted.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/matthewsroundhouse-1024x512.png,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

“Our wealth divide has done nothing but grown,” said Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, who expressed particular concern at some corporate taxes loosening.

That’s what Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, wants the Vermont tax system to be, she said Thursday morning. But following the passage of federal tax law changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, she said, that lofty goal may have become harder to ensure. And she worries the changes could threaten the state’s tax revenue, too.
The House Committee on Ways and Means, which Kornheiser chairs, has lost no time this week diving into the weeds of new federal tax law as it weighs what state-level changes might be necessary or feasible. In lieu of regaling each other with news from the summer, Kornheiser asked lawmakers to name their favorite thing about working on tax policy while introducing themselves on Tuesday.  
“This year marks the 50th year I’ve been married to a CPA,” offered Rep. Carolyn Branagan, R-Georgia.
A number of the federal changes, particularly to corporate taxes, will flow through to Vermont’s tax calculation processes. Like many other states, Vermont uses parts of the federal tax system as a baseline for levying its own fees on taxpayers. 
Patrick Titterton, an analyst in the state’s Legislative Joint Fiscal Office, told the committee Tuesday that changes to tax policy in the new federal budget are complex, with some likely to decrease revenue and some expected to increase it. In summary, small $1.3 million and $4.9 million decreases are projected in each of the next two fiscal years, Titterton said, while other impacts will be less immediate as some new measures take effect over the course of up to 10 years.
Corporate income tax, a notably fickle revenue source, Titterton said Thursday, is projected to provide roughly 10% of Vermont’s General Fund revenue in the 2026 fiscal year.
State lawmakers have decided before that federal tax changes are not in Vermont’s interest. In a 2018 special session, lawmakers “uncoupled” Vermont’s tax code from certain federal provisions around personal income tax. For now, Kornheiser said the state remains much more bound to Washington, D.C., when it comes to corporate taxes.
For Kornheiser, it’s potentially an equity issue.
“Our wealth divide has done nothing but grown,” she said. “The Trump administration’s tax work just did even more to exacerbate that.”

In the know
Flanked by a real who’s-who of health care advocates today, State Treasurer Mike Pieciak held a press conference championing H.577, a bill that his office has steered that aims to bring down the price of prescription drugs.
The bill, sponsored by House Health Care Committee chair Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex Town, and Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, proposes Vermont join a coalition of states — Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada and Connecticut — to pool drug purchasing power, negotiate lower costs and secure bulk discounts. Joining the group would come at no cost to the state, but the bill would allocate $50,000 for the Treasurer’s Office to develop and promote the program.
If the state were to join, anyone in Vermont could receive a free drug discount card and use it instead of insurance when buying a medication. Pieciak said he especially hopes this helps those whose prescriptions may not be covered by Medicare, individuals who have dropped their commercial insurance or those who opted for a less-comprehensive plan. 
Still to come as the bill works its way through the House Health Care Committee: more discussion on whether paying out-of-pocket can count toward one’s deductible.

On the move
The Senate voted to send a bill that would require disclosures on certain AI-generated media back to its Government Operations Committee on Thursday. The committee will review the changes the House made to the bill, S.23, before that chamber passed the measure last year. The Senate never took up the House’s changes before adjourning for 2025. 
Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, the gov ops chair, said in an interview his committee would take testimony on the House’s revisions next week. He said he did not expect the changes would be controversial and that the bill would likely make it back to the floor.
Both the House and Senate versions of S.23 would require certain publishers of images created using AI — and that depict political candidates — to also attach a message stating that the content is fake. The disclosure requirement would apply to these “deepfakes,” as they’re often called, only when they are published within 90 days of an election.

Too hot to handle
Statehouse regulars who opt to bring their own lunch have probably noticed a change in the building this week — there is no longer a microwave available for public use in the cafeteria. Safe to say, the appliance’s sudden disappearance has been a cause of consternation, if not at least several cold meals of leftover takeout.
Sitting in its place is a rather ominous sign from the Sergeant-at-Arms’ Office:
“The microwave in this location was destroyed,” it reads. “At this time, there are no plans to replace the microwave due to continued maintenance and fire-related issues. Thank you.”
Turns out, “fire-related issues” is a polite way of saying that food-reheaters have been responsible for two of the three total fires in the Statehouse over the past year, Sergeant-at-Arms Agatha Kessler said Thursday. The latter of those two conflagrations, she said, caused the appliance’s untimely demise.
Kessler said the fires had taken up a significant amount of emergency responders’ time and resources, which for her outweighed the benefits of keeping the microwave in use. She noted, too, that there are other microwaves located around the building that people can use.
The extent to which those other microwaves are publicly accessible is, sort of, a matter of perspective. It is The People’s House, after all. My advice: Use the one a short walk from the cafeteria in the alcove past the House Commerce and House Corrections rooms.
But maybe follow the advice on the appliance’s door: Use a lid!

Pennie enrollment drops as Congress wrestles with health insurance subsidy vote,Whitney Downard,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/health-care/pa-pennie-enrollment-drops-as-congress-wrestles-with-health-insurance-subsidy-vote/,"So far, an estimated 70,000 Pennsylvanians have ended their coverage, with between 465,000 and 472,000 enrolled as of this week.","A Pennie sign seen at the 2026 Pennsylvania Farm Show on Jan. 8, 2026. (Photo by Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Thousands of Pennsylvanians have left the state’s only Affordable Care Act marketplace, Pennie, following sharp increases in monthly premiums due to expiring enhanced federal subsidies. 
Pennie numbers continue to fluctuate as the U.S. House voted Thursday to extend benefits for moderate-income enrollees for three more years. The measure moves to the Senate and, if approved, would need to be signed by President Donald Trump before the subsidies take effect. At least 70,000 Pennsylvania residents have left the exchange so far. 
For those still enrolled, rising costs means cutting expenses elsewhere. 
Andrew Gehman, who lives in Franklin County, told the Capital-Star that he’d ended a $12,000 contract with a salesperson after his premium jumped from $70 to $240. Gehman, 40, owns and operates a video production company, 2085 Productions, based in Waynesboro, pitching projects from Washington, D.C. to Philadelphia. 
“It’s essential. I had to go to the emergency room six, seven years ago when I didn’t have health insurance … and I think the hospital bill was $6,000 or $7,000,” Gehman said. “I was out of work at the time, so it was 100% (covered by) financial assistance.”
“But the reality is, this is why you need health insurance,” he continued. “Because the whoopsies, the mistakes, the accidents happen.”










We’re just hearing a lot of anxiety and concern from people around the trade-offs that they’re going to have to make financially and the risk that they have to take with their health if they end up going uninsured.


– Pennie Director Devon Trolley


Gehman said he started his company in 2019, paying “basically nothing” at first for Pennie. Last year, his business made $75,000, which doesn’t include expenses. 
While he has found a way to balance his checkbook, others aren’t so fortunate. Some have reported paying nearly $1,800 a month for their Pennie coverage. 
“You should be able to work full time and afford health insurance,” Gehman said. “… It’s so high now for a lot of people and they have to choose between, ‘Well, do I want to make my mortgage payment or my health insurance?’ Obviously, they’re going to get rid of health insurance.”
 Falling Pennie enrollment

In 2025, 497,000 Pennsylvanians were enrolled in Pennie — a record-breaking amount. During the enrollment period from Nov. 1, 2024 and Jan. 15, 2025, 90,000 people signed up.
But, more than halfway through this cycle’s enrollment period, overall enrollment numbers are down by 20,000 people and nearly 1,000 terminate their coverage each day, according to Pennie Director Devon Trolley. As of this week, between 465,000 and 472,000 Pennsylvanians are enrolled in Pennie.  The open enrollment period for this year was extended to Feb. 1.
“We don’t have a lot of insight into where people ended up,” Trolley said. “Anecdotally, from our call center … we’ve been hearing pretty consistently that cost has been a major factor this year.”

The most significant premium increases hit those over the age of 55, Trolley said, especially those earning above the enhanced subsidy cutoff — roughly $62,600 for a single person or $84,600 for a family of two. 
“Take a 60-year-old couple, for example. In 2025, they were paying about $500 or $600 a month and now, in 2026, their bill is $2,000 to $3,000 a month,” said Trolley. “In some cases, we’re seeing the monthly premiums for that population comprise upwards of 50% of their income.”
Preventative care for this age group can be critical to identifying chronic conditions and is a core part of the services covered by the Affordable Care Act, as detailed by health policy group KFF.
“Without health coverage, you’re not catching those early, you’re not managing chronic conditions,” said Trolley. “And by the time they do hit Medicare at age 65, the population is going to be sicker and more costly (to cover).”
To 61-year-old Scott Cannon, of Luzerne County, insurance is “a necessity” at his age.
“I can’t not have it, but I know some people younger than me who are gambling and not having it,” said Cannon. “I’m worried for them because if something were to happen, it’d be a tough situation.”

Cannon is a videographer whose wife works part time at the local library. Together, their monthly bill used to be $83 — which was “very affordable” — and now costs $283. 
“It’s tough because the price of everything is going up … I do a lot of videos, television commercials and social media videos for businesses and AI is being used by those businesses instead,” said Cannon. “So business is getting harder and harder to find.” 
After 30 years of using the same landline for his business, Cannon opted to cancel that contract to make up the cost difference. 
While renewing the policy for him and his wife was fairly straightforward, getting coverage for their youngest daughter has been a challenge. 
After turning 19 in November, she no longer qualifies for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, but might get her own policy through Medicaid. However, a paperwork mixup seems to have closed that pathway, so the Cannons are looking at adding her to the family plan.
“We’re already paying more than we did last year, so now we’re going to add my daughter’s insurance on top of that,” said Cannon. “In the meantime, I don’t think my daughter’s covered.”
 Over in Congress

Though the credits are designed to make coverage more affordable, it comes with a $1 trillion price tag for the federal government, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending the subsidies for those making about the threshold makes up roughly $35 billion of that estimate. 
The enhanced benefit is a recent development — part of a 2021 COVID-19 relief package that passed under former President Joe Biden and expired at the end of 2025. Extending the subsidies is popular across the country, according to KFF polling, but Republicans point to mounting costs for taxpayers. 
US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote

In the House, votes fell largely along partisan lines, though three swing district Pennsylvanian representatives joined Democrats to advance the bill: Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (1st District), Ryan Mackenzie (7th District) and Rob Bresnahan (8th District).
The commonwealth’s seven other Republican lawmakers voted against the measure. 
The U.S. Senate has been working on its own health care package over the interim, and may not take up the House’s effort. 
Not knowing where Congress will land complicates Pennie’s work, Trolley said. A “straight extension” would be the quickest to implement, she added, but “any changes beyond that would take more time to understand.”
“If congressional action does occur, we would make sure to provide some opportunity for people to come back in and change their mind,” said Trolley. “What that looks like really depends on when exactly an extension would occur and what that extension looks like.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_8191-1024x768.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Jared Polis.
Lawmakers, workers and union members crammed into the space outside the governor’s office in the state Capitol on Thursday to announce the return of the so-called Worker Protection Act. The legislative session begins next week.
“We’re back here because the problem did not go away,” Rep. Javier Mabrey, a Denver Democrat who will once again run the bill, said. “You hear politician after politician saying ‘Affordability, affordability, affordability.’ Well, we are here with an actual, real solution to increase worker power and to increase wages.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Alongside Mabrey, the bill will be backed by Rep. Jennifer Bacon, a Denver Democrat and Sen. Jessie Danielson, a Wheat Ridge Democrat.
The bill, like last year’s version, would get rid of a second union election rule, unique to Colorado, to form what’s known as a strong union. After a majority of workers vote to form a union, as outlined in federal law, there is a second election with a 75% threshold for workers to negotiate which employees need to pay dues. The second election does not compel union membership, but it opens the door to discuss whether all employees should pay into the union representation they benefit from.
“That second election just gives employers more time to intimidate workers and shut down organizing efforts before workers ever get a real seat at the table,” Danielson said.










Service workers are the backbone of our communities, but too many of us can't afford to even live where we work. We should not be punished and our vote should not be delayed.


– Josh Reitze, a cook at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater


Colorado is the only state to have a second election requirement, and workers say it can be an arduous process. Josh Reitze, a cook at the Alamo Drafthouse movie theater in Denver’s Sloan’s Lake neighborhood, said his union voted to form in 2024 and began negotiations in September of that year. Members are just now waiting for the results of that second election, 15 months since the union was created.
“Service workers are the backbone of our communities, but too many of us can’t afford to even live where we work. We should not be punished and our vote should not be delayed,” Reitze said. “The Worker Protection Act matters because it would stop companies from dragging out the process and using fear to silence its workers.”
Business groups generally support the second election requirement, which has been Colorado law since the 1940s.
Last year, the Worker Protection Act languished in the Legislature as business groups, legislators and unions tried to reach a compromise at the behest of Polis, who said he would not sign a bill that both sides didn’t agree to. Negotiations collapsed, and the bill passed unchanged with every Democrat in support. Polis, also a Democrat, then vetoed it. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill’s resurgence.
Mabrey told reporters on Thursday that Polis had “not explicitly” said he would veto this year’s bill, but there has not been discussion with the business community in the legislative interim.
“We do not need a task force to figure this out,” Mabrey said. “We need a governor who has the courage to stand with workers.”
This will be the final regular legislative session with Polis as governor. Sen. Michael Bennet and Attorney General Phil Weiser are the Democrats running to replace him, though neither have said whether they support the legislation.
“Maybe if we fail this year, we can get it done next year,” Mabrey said.
The 120-day legislative session begins on Jan. 14. Democrats hold wide majorities in both chambers.

This is the new reality most bus riders have faced since the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) enacted the most significant service reductions in its 59-year history last September, according to a report released Thursday by a coalition of public transit advocates.
The 14-page report looks at the impact of those cuts on both riders and bus operators as the cash-strapped agency closed a multimillion dollar funding gap that originated with Gov. Dan McKee’s fiscal 2026 budget. When the 2025 legislative session ended last June, RIPTA was still $18 million in the red.
A week before McKee is expected to drop his proposed fiscal 2027 budget, Save RIPTA coalition members joined lawmakers in the State House library to go over their new findings and present a laundry list of bills they want introduced in the 2026 General Assembly to get more Rhode Islanders on the bus.
The report found that 75% of RIPTA’s routes lost ridership since September when the cuts took effect.
“We told y’all what would happen,” Liza Burkin, an organizer with Save RIPTA, told the crowd. 
Save RIPTA’s report notes the agency started the second half of 2024 with the appointment of a permanent CEO while being kept afloat by the last of the state’s pandemic aid granted by the federal government.
“Things were looking up — temporarily,” the report states.
But 2025 did not see the same relief given to RIPTA, resulting in reductions on 46 of its 67 bus lines — the most significant cuts in the agency’s 59-year history. That’s because McKee initially declined to fill a $32.6 million deficit for the agency as he and other state leaders awaited an overdue efficiency study to find ways to cut costs and “right size” operations.
The General Assembly eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue. RIPTA administrators working with McKee’s office found other savings, but it still was not enough to avoid the service reductions.
The report found RIPTA has been less efficient as an agency since the cuts were made last fall. 
In fiscal year 2025, RIPTA spent $183 per service hour on operations. Now it costs the agency over $236 per service hour — a 29% increase.
At the same time, the report found 21 of RIPTA’s routes operate at least once an hour every day — a statistic referred to as a “lowest minimum frequency standard.” Before service cuts were enacted, the coalition’s report found 33 bus lines operated on at least an hourly basis.
“And we wonder why we can’t grow ridership,” Burkin said. “Frequency is the core — you need to go to the bus stop and know another one will come.”
Chrys Santos, a sophomore at the Blackstone Academy Charter School in Pawtucket, told the crowd she was recently an hour-and-a-half late for class after watching two full buses skip by her stop.
“I missed two of my morning classes and my grades in algebra and Spanish went down by five points,” Santos said.
RIPTA’s cuts haven’t been easy on drivers either. Jorge Alves, who has worked as a bus driver for the last 13 years, said he’s had little break time after trips. He said passengers are becoming more agitated as the less frequent buses start to get more crammed.
“It’s become very stressful to work,” Alves said. “The pressure’s always on you to go faster and get more done in the same amount of time.”

Happy new year with a $14 million deficit
RIPTA’s board of directors in December approved a fiscal 2027 budget request that has a nearly $14 million deficit to send to McKee’s office — with hopes it would be filled by the governor and lawmakers.
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said the governor intends to plug RIPTA’s gap in his budget recommendation set to be unveiled next week. She did not state how he would like to see the state plug the agency’s deficit.
But even that funding commitment is still not enough to restore service to what it was before last fall.
RIPTA once again counts on Gov. McKee to fill its budget gap

“The $13.8 million is required to run service as it currently exists today,” Sara Furbush, a RIPTA spokesperson, said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
To regain lost service, advocates say the state would need to allocate an additional $5 million — something advocates hope the state will provide to RIPTA through a supplemental budget allocation.
Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, and Rep. Karen Alzate, a Pawtucket Democrat, attended the event in the State House library. They intend to sponsor the legislation that will allocate the additional funding.
“Properly funding RIPTA isn’t a drain on our budgets,” Alzate said. “It is an investment in prosperity in an equitable and sustainable Rhode Island.”
Advocates want to see bus service grow, which is why their biggest priority is to get RIPTA an additional $10 million in annual revenue by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account to 20%.
In the state’s most recent budget, lawmakers had granted RIPTA 15% of the account funded by vehicle registration fees.
Legislation to up RIPTA’s share will be sponsored in the House by Rep. Terri Cortvriend, a Portsmouth Democrat. A Senate sponsor has not yet been identified, Burkin told reporters.
“We need to pass these bills to stabilize finances and start to grow and expand RIPTA, not just save it,” Burkin said. “And that starts today.”



6 ways to better bus service in Rhode Island
Advocates outlined a half dozen additional policy priorities to enhance bus service in Rhode Island. They include bills that Save RIPTA hopes will be introduced in the General Assembly soon, organizer Liza Burkin said.

Shift the state’s existing 7% sales tax on rideshare trips toward RIPTA’s paratransit programs. Save RIPTA’s report projects $10 million to $15 million in annual revenue from the tax. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, and in the House by Jennifer Stewart, a Pawtucket Democrat.
Require companies with 500 or more employees to provide transit passes via RIPTA Wave to Work program. Revenue has not yet been calculated. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Jake Bissailion, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Deputy Speaker Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat.
Put a $100 million bond referendum on this year’s ballot. RIPTA would use proceeds toward capital projects such as new bus shelters, creating dedicated bus lanes, and updating fare technology. Legislation will be sponsored in the Senate by Lamis Vargas, a Cranston Democrat, and in the House by Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat.
Raise car inspection fees. Proceeds would go into the Highway Maintenance Account. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Vargas. A primary House sponsor has not been identified.
Restructure RIPTA’s board of directors. The coalition wants to see Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr. ousted as RIPTA’s board chairman. Lawmakers in 2023 adopted a plan to reorganize the board with the state’s transportation chief heading the board to broaden oversight of the bus agency. Legislation to undo that shakeup would be sponsored in the Senate by Tiara Mack, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Tanzi.
Adjust the gas tax to account for inflation every two years. Projections only consider inflation from the previous year. Legislation would be sponsored in the Senate by Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat, and in the House by Stewart.

At left is PSC chair Randy Christmann. (Photo by Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Two power companies are asking the North Dakota Public Service Commission to make a determination that some local zoning ordinances along a proposed powerline are overly restrictive, which would trigger a new law that says state zoning rules trump local ordinances for transmission lines. 
An attorney representing Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities announced the request Thursday at the start of a hearing on the Jamestown to Ellendale high-voltage powerline project, also known as JETx.
Jason Weiers, manager of transmission policy and contracts for Otter Tail Power, testified that overly restrictive ordinances in townships along the proposed route threaten to make the project unfeasible. 
Otter Tail Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities would jointly construct, own and operate the 92-mile powerline. The companies asked the three-person PSC to find the setback ordinances of some townships overly restrictive, making the state’s 500-foot setback from occupied residences the standard. 
Weiers said Homer and Corwin townships in Stutsman County and Willowbank Township in LaMoure County have passed ordinances requiring that high-voltage powerlines be 2,640 feet, or half a mile, away from an occupied residence. 
Weiers said in Homer Township the setback is essentially a “ban on the development of high-voltage power lines.” In Corwin and Willowbank, the setback makes routing the powerline  “nearly impossible.” 
Three townships in LaMoure County — Russell, Wano and Willowbank — also have passed moratoriums on high-voltage power lines. Weiers said the moratoriums “appear to target the project directly.”
North Dakota using new split hearing option on controversial power line

The Legislature passed a bill in 2025 specifying that state zoning rules can supersede local ordinances. The law took effect Aug. 1. The JETx project was referenced in testimony about the bill. 
The companies say the project is needed to improve grid reliability in the Jamestown area, which has been hit by both winter and summer storms in recent years, forcing power use to be curtailed. 
Rob Frank, director of electric transmission engineering for MDU, said the line connecting to two other high-voltage lines offers “significant reliability benefits” and also would improve transmission into South Dakota. 
The companies hope to start construction later this year with completion in 2028. 
Weiers said the project is estimated to cost $406 million. He said routing around townships with restrictive ordinances could add $24 million to the cost. 
The project would use 502 single pole supports that would be 120 feet to 180 feet tall. 
The PSC set aside two days for a technical hearing on the project, with Otter Tail and MDU officials providing detailed information. 
Next week, the PSC will hold hearings in Ellendale, Edgeley and Jamestown to gather public input. It is the first time the PSC has used a newly established process for holding separate technical and public hearings. 
Weiers said 134 of 173 landowners — 77% — along the route have signed agreements to allow the powerline to run through their property. He said that equates to 76% of the length of the 92 mile line.  
The Public Service Commission previously approved a certificate of need for the project but still needs to approve a route permit.

Commission Chairman Randy Christmann voted against the project last year and Thursday asked more questions. 
“Is it about hooking up to renewables or is it about reliability?” he asked Weiers, referring to wind power in the area. 
Weiers said that the project benefits improved transmission from wind turbines west of Ellendale and grid reliability. 
Christmann asked Frank why easement signings seemed to be low and resistance from townships is unusually high. 
Frank cited “landowner fatigue” to new projects of all kinds but said easement signings were typical for a powerline project. 
“Some landowners are unwilling to sign over property rights for anything,” he said.

Andy Ogles of Tennessee's 5th Congressional District responded by calling for Nashville's mayor to be arrested. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)On Tuesday, after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was shot in Minneapolis at close range by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee’s 5th District didn’t wait too long to weigh in with his opinions. 
If you’ve been following Ogles, who was first elected to Congress in 2022, you won’t be surprised to hear he didn’t offer sympathy. 
No, he posted first on social media that Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell should be arrested. 
“Minneapolis Mayor (Jacob) Frey and Nashville Mayor O’Connell are cut from the same cloth. It’s deeper than rhetoric, its (sic) political decisions intended to betray ICE and Federal partners. ICE agents are in danger because of them. Illegal aliens are NOT our friends. They should be arrested immediately,” wrote Ogles on X and Facebook. 
The reference to Mayor Frey came after he said, in a press conference following the shooting, that ICE needs to “get the f- – – out of Minneapolis.” 
Four hours later, he posted, “Send the (National) Guard to Nashville!” and said that the shooting of Good was justified. 
There’s a lot to unpack here but what stands out — beyond the obviously heinous and inhumane support for the killing of an innocent woman by federal agents — is a sitting congressman’s apparent willingness to call out the military in his own district, for what appears to be no reason other than to mess with the mayor of the largest city in that district. 
Besides the fact that O’Connell has done nothing more than say about May ICE raids in Nashville that “these people don’t share our values,” Ogles’ call for arresting him shines a dangerous spotlight on O’Connell in a period in which political violence is a clear and present danger. 

Pray for our ICE patriots. Democrats continue to demonize the men and women doing everything in their power to make our country safe.
If you put an ICE agent in mortal danger, self-defense is JUSTIFIED. https://t.co/iIALKYhzFz
— Rep. Andy Ogles (@RepOgles) January 7, 2026

Less than a year ago, a man dressed as a police officer murdered Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband after shooting a state senator and his wife. 
Surely, I thought to myself — surely — some members of our federal delegation will respond to the shooting in a more dignified and compassionate way. 
U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen of the Memphis-based 9th Congressional District and the only Democrat in the delegation, issued a statement.
“Today’s incident is just what I feared: out-of-control, masked ICE agents fatally misusing their authority and inflaming our communities. Today, it happened in Minneapolis, but it could be Memphis, which also has an outsized and aggressive ICE presence,” the statement read. 
I decided to check the social media feeds of the other members of Tennessee’s federal delegation, including U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, and found little. 
U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of Knoxville’s 2nd Congressional District, used the somber day to call for investigation into the immigration records of his Democratic colleague, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota congresswoman who was born in Somalia but emigrated to the U.S. with her family when she was 13. 
To initiate such proceedings at all, but especially on the day an American citizen was gunned down in the district Omar represents, is beyond petty: It’s callous, repugnant and hateful.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security initially deployed thousands of ICE agents to Minneapolis as part of a Trump administration operation targeting Somalian immigrants, all because an article claimed — with little evidence to support it — that Somalian residents are defrauding public programs in the state and using the money gained to fund terrorist organizations. 
It may be a new low for Burchett, but at least we know where he stands. 
Finding nothing on Wednesday’s social media feeds of Tennessee’s other six U.S. representatives and two senators reflecting on the Minnesota tragedy, I emailed their press secretaries. 
I heard back from only 6th District Rep. John Rose, a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. 
In a statement, Rose said, “What happened in Minneapolis is tragic. No one wants to see a young woman lose her life or children lose their mother. It’s awful.
“But, we must acknowledge the facts. Multiple law enforcement officials were attempting to communicate with Ms. Good who, rather than responding in a reasonable manner, steered her car and accelerated toward a federal law enforcement official,” read the statement.  Life-saving action was taken to prevent the death of that officer.”
I give him credit for responding, although the videos viewed by my colleagues at the Minnesota Reformer do not support this version of events;  from the other members of the delegation, I received nothing: not a “no comment,” much less a tepid “thoughts and prayers” comment of the type our elected officials usually offer. 
Again, I checked their social media accounts on Thursday. 
Blackburn, also running in the Republican gubernatorial primary, called for the denaturalization of anyone “who comes to the United States to steal from the American people” by committing fraud. 
A few months ago, Charlie Kirk, a right wing podcaster, was shot and killed by a private citizen at a speaking event and these same representatives didn’t hesitate to post that they were “devastated” by his murder — which is fine and appropriate. Kirk’s murder was horrendous and lawmakers of both major political persuasions should have, and did, speak out against it and political violence in general. 
Yet, most of the same Tennessee lawmakers that expressed sadness and rage over one killing, expressed not an ounce of empathy for Good’s family or offered solace to their own constituents feeling fear, hurt and sadness.
Know that most, if not all, of these representatives will be reelected in November, and unless electoral trends experience a cataclysmic reversal in the next eight months, Rose or Blackburn will be Tennessee’s next governor.
It’s important to assess their reactions to the killing of a citizen by government agents, because while I hope this is the last such incident, I am fearful it will not be.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A legislative task force on hazing on Louisiana’s college campuses is recommending increased required training for all students — not just those in Greek organizations — and greater penalties for universities that shirk their obligations. 
The task force, named in honor of Southern University student Caleb Wilson, who died in a hazing incident last year, is composed of legislators, public higher education officials and college students. Five people have been indicted in connection with Wilson’s February death during a pledge initiation for the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. The chapter has been removed from Southern’s campus though it has the option to appeal and return.
Members of the task force, created last year by Southern alumnus Rep. Jason Hughes, D-New Orleans, met for the final time Thursday. They voted to recommend legislation that would require annual anti-hazing training for public college and university students and advisers to student organizations, who are typically school faculty or staff members. The legislative panel also emphasized the need to require the training for “external advisers” who are not university employees such as those who work with Greek organizations. 
The task force considered a proposal to require training for all faculty and staff, but LSU Vice President and General Counsel Trey Jones, a task force member, raised concerns that a mandate for thousands of employees was overbroad. The task force settled on expanding the requirement to more faculty and staff members, though the legislature will have to determine which employees will be required to take part in the training. 
The group also recommended adopting amnesty policies that would allow students to report hazing without fear of repercussions for violating other university policies. 
The panel also agreed it was key to roll back a 2024 law, Act 416 by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, that dramatically increased the standard of evidence required to prove a hazing charge in campus disciplinary proceedings from “preponderance of evidence” to “clear and convincing.” 
Under the old standard, administrators could hold a student responsible if the evidence points to it being at least slightly more likely than not the student is responsible. Even if there is conflicting testimony, a student whistleblower could be punished if the evidence tipped the scale just past a 50% likelihood. 
Now universities need clear and convincing evidence, a standard used in some court cases such as proving fraud or terminating parental rights. The threshold requires evidence that points to the student’s guilt being substantially more probable than not, and it might require multiple witnesses, photos or other reports to firmly convince administrators.
Clearing that bar can be difficult because, unlike in courtroom proceedings, administrators don’t have as much power to gather evidence. 
University officials on the panel said the new standard of evidence makes it nearly impossible to hold students accountable for hazing and could eventually lead to schools not attempting to discipline students for offenses because it could open them up to legal liability. 
The task force also recommended universities include a section on hazing in the annual power-based violence reports they make to the legislature, and that the information is also posted to universities’ websites. Under current law, schools that fail to submit the reports are prohibited from going before the state Bond Commission for two years, effectively limiting them from any of major infrastructure or building projects during that period. The same penalty was  recommended for failure to submit a hazing report. 
The group also highlighted the need to identify dedicated dollars to support hazing prevention, training and reporting. 
Their priorities are likely to be addressed in the upcoming legislative session, which begins March 9. Rep. Vanessa LaFleur, D-Baton Rouge, said lawmakers will meet soon to decide who will sponsor the bills. 
Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said he would also sponsor legislation to clarify the difference between suspending and expelling a student organization.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)An investigation of unlawful computer use and computer-generated pornography sharing by a former employee of the state Division of Motor Vehicles has turned up at least 50 victims, South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley announced Thursday.
Mark Rathbun, 68, of Aberdeen, was initially indicted in November for solicitation of rape, possession of child pornography and unauthorized use of computer systems. Those charges related to two victims, one of whom he’d been involved in a “domestic relationship” with, according to court documents.
At the time, Jackley said investigators following up on a tip about child pornography found driver’s license images on some of the 30 electronic devices in Rathbun’s home. Jackley’s office declined to outline any connections there may be between the victims of driver’s license data theft and computer-generated pornography, citing the ongoing investigation.
The investigation was likely to turn up more victims, Jackley said at a November press conference.
Attorney general charges former state employee with computer misuse, child porn, rape solicitation

This week, Rathbun was named in an 85-count indictment that references 50 victims. One of the indictment’s 26 counts of child porn possession relates to a video of an unnamed minor engaged in a sex act; the other 25 are tied to “computer-generated” pornographic images of real children, identified by initials. Some of the children’s initials are tied to multiple images.
Eighteen counts involve the alleged dissemination or sale of computer-generated pornography, again involving imagery of real people identified by initials, some of whom were younger than 17. 
The remaining 40 charges are for unlawful use of computer systems. The indictment lists 10 counts for accessing “confidential driver’s license data or material pertaining to” victims without specifying exactly what information may have been taken. The rest relate to Rathbun’s alleged copying or obtaining of driver’s license image files.
Based on the initials listed in the indictment, two of the alleged victims of driver’s license data theft were also depicted in computer-generated pornography. One victim whose photo was allegedly lifted from the driver’s license system was depicted in 10 separate computer-generated images.
“We continue to review images found on his electronic devices and will reach out to potential victims for notification,” Jackley said in his Thursday news release.
If convicted on all counts, Rathbun faces up to 395 years in prison.
Rathbun is one of numerous former state employees charged with crimes over the past two years. One former Department of Social Services employee named Lonna Carroll was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of $1.8 million from the state across multiple years. Other former state employees have been accused or found guilty of forging food service inspections, falsifying child abuse reports, creating false vehicle titles and issuing themselves a medical marijuana card.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Legislature is taking steps to improve security for its members, including removing requirements in state law for home addresses to be publicly disclosed and initiating security training for all lawmakers. 
Lawmakers on Thursday directed legislative staff to prepare a memo describing how both initiatives can be accomplished following a confidential security briefing from the North Dakota Highway Patrol. 
“We live in a different world than we lived in 10 years ago,” said Sen. Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, during a discussion following the confidential briefing. 
The briefing, which presented a threat assessment of the Capitol complex and guidance to legislators who receive threats, prompted both concerns and shrugs from some lawmakers. 
North Dakota lawmakers to hold hearing on security concerns after Minnesota attacks

Reps. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, and Anna Novak, R-Hazen, live in rural communities. They said there is a limit to the security precautions they can take when most of their community can recognize their vehicles or homes on sight. 
“The reality is, especially for those of us in rural areas, everybody knows where we live,” Weisz said. “It’s not like you can have any security sitting out on your farmstead.”
At the same time, they said they appreciated the briefing from law enforcement, which was prompted in part by the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers last June. Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, and her husband Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home.
“She was attacked in her home,” Novak said. “That’s the scary part. But I live in a small town, very much pro Second Amendment, and so I feel pretty safe because of that.”
Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were also wounded in a shooting at their home, and investigators found a list of other Democratic lawmakers in the vehicle of Vance Boelter, who has been charged with the crimes.
The Highway Patrol did not make any policy recommendations during the confidential session, but the information prompted two proposals from lawmakers. 
In addition to the security training sessions for all legislators and staff at the start of every legislative session, there was also a lot of concern that state law requires lawmakers to include their home addresses on several filings that executive branch agencies are in turn required to make available to the public. 
“They are required to disclose our home address,” said. Rep. Kristin Roers, R-Fargo. “We need to think about where else in code, where else on the web, are we disclosing addresses?”
The committee directed Legislative Council to prepare a list of places in state law that need to be amended in order to change that. John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, encouraged legislators to begin using post office boxes when they have to provide contact information.

The Capitol threat assessment identifies potential vulnerabilities in the building and will not be disclosed to the public. Weisz said the Highway Patrol may ask for additional funding for security during the next regular legislative session but no specifics of the threat assessment were provided. North Dakota installed metal detectors at the public entrance of the Capitol in 2017, a response to Dakota Access Pipeline protests, which also included some demonstrations in Bismarck. The security measure was made permanent after that legislative session. 
While there has not been a notable long-term increase in threats reported by lawmakers to the Highway Patrol, North Dakota is not insulated against potential threats crossing state lines, Lt. Jenna Clawson Huibregtse said. 
“North Dakota isn’t immune from people coming from other states as well,” Clawson Huibregtse said. “Threats that come in to political officials aren’t necessarily always people that are from North Dakota.”
Weisz is one of the lawmakers who has received multiple threats against himself and his family over time. It’s not pleasant, but there isn’t much he can do but take common sense precautions, Weisz said. 
“I’m not gonna live my life in fear,” he said. 
Security costs
Personal security, especially while at home, has been a prominent concern among lawmakers since the Minnesota attacks. Legislative Council removed legislators’ home addresses from the website shortly afterwards. 
Yet while the Highway Patrol provides security at the Capitol complex and can provide assistance at official events elsewhere in the state, there are few options for legislators who desire more protection in their districts or at their homes. The Highway Patrol, authorized to employ 171 officers, does not have the staffing to provide regular assistance to all 141 state lawmakers. 
State lawmakers reconsider costs, purpose of serving after Minnesota assassination

The North Dakota Ethics Commission, a few weeks after the shooting in the neighboring state, issued an advisory opinion interpreting state law as allowing campaign funds to be used on security expenditures in certain situations. Attorney General Drew Wrigley overruled that in a legal opinion of his own late last year, declaring the advisory opinion void. 
Some states like Minnesota offer stipends to lawmakers for security costs. North Dakota is not one of them. But the National Conference of State Legislatures is planning to launch a new $1.5 million Security Fund next month that may fill some of the gap. 
Bryan Thomas, chief communications officer, said every state legislature will receive funding based on its membership count. The legislatures will have the flexibility to spend the dollars as they see fit, whether on group training sessions or stipends to individuals for small purchases like doorbell cameras, as long as it is broadly available and not limited to a select few lawmakers. 
“There’ll be really flexible dollars that legislatures will have access to, to support their members to help a little bit in their security for themselves and their families,” Thomas said. 
He said there is sufficient funding to provide an average of $200 per legislator across the country. That’s far less than stipends offered by some states, such as Minnesota, which provides a stipend up to $4,500 for home security. But if the program is successful and the organization can identify additional funding, it could continue in future years. 
“$200 doesn’t go a long way, but it certainly helps,” Thomas said.

“Her commitment to public service and her ability to navigate complex policy issues make her uniquely qualified to help navigate important decisions and support increased transparency and accountability for key public investment approved by the Board of Public Works. I am thrilled to welcome her to Team Comptroller,” Lierman’s statement said.
Jones stepped down from the rostrum in December. Lambert, along with Jones’ Chief of Staff Matt Jackson and Communications Director Marty McGowan, were replaced as new House Speaker Joseline Peña Melnyk moved staff from her legislative and committee offices into those senior positions.
Earlier this week, Senate President Bill Ferguson announced Jackson has joined his office.
Also on Wednesday, Lierman announced Thomas Brennan III, a five-year veteran of the office, was promoted to serve as her liaison to the Board of Public Works — a deputy to Lambert.
“It is a pleasure to have Thomas Brennan as our Board of Public Works Liaison. He is an invaluable member of our team whose diligence, expertise, and commitment are invaluable to our approach to board business,” Lierman said in her statement. “I look forward to seeing Thomas grow into his new role and the strong partnership he and Director Lambert will form in the coming year.”

Jan. 8, 2026. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Calling affordable child care vital to Nebraska’s workforce, business leaders joined other advocates Thursday in championing a proposed state law to extend current income eligibility levels for a child care subsidy.
Hunter Traynor, executive vice president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry was among dozens gathered at the State Capitol in support of Legislative Bill 304, which would make permanent the income eligibility caps enacted into law in 2021.

Now set to expire in October, income eligibility for the state child care subsidy program was raised from 130% to 185% of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that meant household earnings could be $59,000 instead of $42,000.
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, who was part of a bipartisan group of about 20 lawmakers supporting the bill, said she has named LB 304 her priority legislation for the 2026 session.
The bill stalled last year in a committee, as state officials estimated the annual financial impact at about $14 million in general funds. The state’s latest shortfall is estimated at $471 million. DeBoer said Thursday she was working with the Department of Health and Human Services to find the additional funding to support the bill.
“While there is a cost to this child care assistance, the cost to the state of doing nothing is much larger,” she said. “So we will find a fiscal solution.”
Said Traynor: “Passing this legislation would help nearly 3,000 families remain eligible for child care assistance and help employers remain fully staffed in an extremely tight labor market.”
Child care providers and advocacy agencies said that was a conservative number.

Traynor pointed to a recent report estimating the annual state impact of inadequate child care at $1.7 billion in lost business output and $1.6 billion in lost labor income, including both direct and multiplier effects. He said that leads to a loss of nearly $64 million in state income tax revenue and 6,843 jobs. 
The report was prepared for the Nebraska Chamber Foundation in partnership with First Five Nebraska and the Bureau of Business Research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. It says that the median annual cost for child care services ranges between $9,000 and $15,000 per child for center-based care.
DeBoer said the state was at a “crisis point” in 2021 when it changed the child care subsidy eligibility levels to help parents remain in the workplace. She said assistance came in other ways as well, including streamlining the process for background checks of child care workers.
“The work isn’t done,” she said.
If the bill does not pass, child care representatives said Nebraska would fall to No. 48 in the nation for access to child care subsidies based on income eligibility. Currently, Nebraska ranks at 38, said First Five Nebraska, a child care advocacy agency. 
Nebraska’s child care assistance program is funded by a mix of federal and state funds for a total of about $110 million a year, First Five said. 
Former Nebraska football player Derek Branch also spoke, urging former Husker defensive back Gov. Jim Pillen to stand by “working families and their children” by supporting the bill.
“Now is not the time to drop the ball,” Branch said.

 ‘My lifeline’

Haley Overman, a widowed mom of three children, said she would be among the families that would lose a child care subsidy if the eligibility income levels were to return to previous levels in October.
“It’s basically my lifeline,” she said, noting that she lost a second income when her husband died. 
Overman, who works in the medical billing industry, said she has a house and car payment and is uncertain of how her family life would change further if she lost the child care subsidy. She said she might have to sell their home. 
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, also among the speakers, also turned to Nebraska’s workforce concerns in voicing support for the bill. 
“This is a practical, Nebraska-focused investment, one that supports work, strengthens families and keeps businesses competitive in both rural and urban communities,” he said.

Melanie Stansbury celebrated the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a measure to renew health insurance subsidies Thursday.,"U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) addresses attendees at an Oct. 20, 2025 Rio Rancho town hall. Stansbury called the Jan. 8, 2026 passage of a proposal to renew and extend health insurance subsidies ‘a huge deal.’ (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-New Mexico) on Thursday called the U.S. House of Representatives’ passage of a measure to renew health insurance subsidies that expired at the end of 2025 “a huge deal,” in a call with news media.
“These subsidies help to massively expand the number of uninsured individuals to actually have access to health care,” said Stansbury, who represents the state’s 1st Congressional District. The bill advanced on a 230-196 vote, with 17 Republicans joining House Democrats to send it to the Senate.
The expiration of subsidies created by Congress in 2021 for the Affordable Care Act was the main factor in prompting the longest ever federal government shutdown late last year.
Republicans wouldn’t agree to extend subsidies for the cost of health care insurance in state marketplaces, so millions of Americans as of January face increases for the costs of copays, deductibles, and premiums.
Just before the holiday recess, four Republican members joined House Democrats in forcing the vote, defying Republican leadership. On Wednesday — in a new session of Congress — nine Republicans joined Democrats on the procedural action to take up the issue.
Stansbury said the current version of the bill, which extends tax subsidies for the next three years, will likely see changes in the Senate, where similar measures failed to advance in December.
“But it does create a new political pathway and pressure in the Senate and with the White House, especially with Republican support, to get some sort of extension, hopefully, in the coming weeks,” Stansbury said.

While the sticker shock is driving declines for enrollment in other states, New Mexico earlier this week reported a third enrollment increase.
Prior to the subsidies’ expiration, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state lawmakers in a special legislative session in October, approved $17.3 million to offset the costs of tax credits, covering the portion the federal government paid for 6,000 New Mexicans whose income is more than 400% of the federal poverty level.
Stansbury on Thursday praised the state government’s “very proactive” actions during the special session, but said Congressional action for the extension would be needed to ensure the approximately 27,000 New Mexicans currently requiring state assistance can access health insurance coverage.
In her budget request for the 2027 fiscal year, Lujan Grisham proposed the Legislature allot more than $81 million during the upcoming 2026 Legislative session to “to keep health insurance affordable for New Mexicans.” The Legislative Finance Committee’s version of the budget proposal recommends earmarking $126.6 million to the state’s Health Care Affordability Fund to lower the costs for health care.
In addition to the health care subsidies, Stansbury expressed condolences during the call with news outlets for the family of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed Wednesday by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis.

“Many across the United States, including in New Mexico, are feeling afraid,” Stansbury said. “We’re receiving literally hundreds of calls from New Mexicans right now, who are scared about what might happen next, what the administration might do next, whether or not they’re going to come and invade our community.”
She said she and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) will bring articles of impeachment against U.S. Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem, saying the department has “has abused its authority, as committed acts of violence,” and also cited the reports of Noem’s alleged self-dealing in violation of ethics rules.
She told members of the news media that she was not necessarily concerned about an increased presence of immigration authorities in New Mexico. “The risk is there, but we are doing all of the things that we can as both the members of Congress, state officials and local officials to make sure the New Mexicans are safe and that the legal rights of New Mexicans are protected,” she said.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa House Democrats said Thursday they plan to propose a constitutional amendment during the upcoming legislative session to prevent future changes to the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System.
Concerns about potential changes arose during discussions by a task force appointed by Gov. Kim Reynolds aimed at saving taxpayer dollars.
Rep. Sean Bagniewski, House minority whip, and Senate Majority Leader Janice Weiner answered questions from reporters about their plans and expectations for the 2026 legislative session at the Iowa Capitol Press Association legislative preview forum Thursday. Republican leaders, House Speaker Pat Grassley, Senate Majority Leader Mike Klimesh and Reynolds, were invited but declined to attend.
The discussion of retirement plans was started by the Iowa DOGE task force, which suggested in August the state might move the public employees’ retirement system from a defined benefits program to a defined contribution program, where both the employee and employer would contribute to the retirement fund.
This proposal was met with significant backlash from public employees and advocates who said the change could endanger IPERS’ solvency. In the task force’s final list of  recommendations submitted to Reynolds, the proposal was changed to suggest Iowa conducts an ongoing study of of public employees’ benefits — which would include examining the viability of a defined contribution plan. If feasible, the task force suggested public employees be allowed to decide if they want to stay on IPERS in its current form or move to a defined contribution plan, while not making changes to IPERS for current public employees.
Several Republican lawmakers have stated there is currently no interest in making changes to IPERS. But Democrats said Thursday that does not mean Iowans should stop paying attention to the issue.
“I keep hearing from Republican colleagues, ‘They don’t have the appetite for it this year,'” Weiner said. “… So my question is, does that mean they’ll have the appetite for it next year, or the year after that? IPERS is a well-run system. It is essential for recruiting and retaining employees for the state of Iowa, for our correctional system, for our law enforcement, our teachers, and we should not meddle with it, period.”
Bagniewski said House Democrats have similar concerns. He pointed to Republicans’ approach in 2017 to changing public sector collective bargaining law and the 2023 Education Savings Account program as examples of policy where Republicans said, “there’s just a proposal, we’re just talking about it, we’re not going to do it. And then all of a sudden, they’re doing it.”
Because Democrats are concerned about Republicans deciding to later move forward with a proposal to change IPERS, Bagniewski said the House minority party plans to introduce a constitutional amendment to “protect IPERS.”
“We’re going to make Iowa Republican put their money where their mouth is,” Bagniewski said. “If they really want to preserve IPERS, then they’re going to have to do it.”
Bagniewski said the proposed constitutional amendment would bar the Legislature from making major changes to the current set-up of IPERS — particularly preventing future changes like the task force’s proposed opt-in or opt-out from the defined benefits program structure. He said this proposal is necessary in order to prevent the Legislature from taking actions that could threaten IPERS stability for both future and current employees.
“The whole system is built on the people who are currently in, paying for the people who retire,” Bagniewski said. So once you take that out, and then you have a deficit, the whole system explodes. So we want to preserve it in its current form by the Constitution.”
Amendments to the state Constitution must be passed by the Iowa Legislature in two consecutive general assemblies, and then go before voters on the next general election ballot. If approved by a simple majority as a ballot measure, the amendment will be adopted.

U.S. District Court Judge Stefan R. Underhill, who is the presiding judge for Diamantis’ upcoming federal trial on corruption charges, suggested that Pattis continue to represent Diamantis at a public defender’s rate.
“If you are asking, then I will do it,” Pattis told the judge during the hearing, which took place Thursday evening on Zoom.
Underhill then said he was going to delay the trial until at least April.
Jury selection for Diamantis’ second corruption trial was supposed to begin on Jan. 30, but Pattis told prosecutors and Underhill that a murder trial that he started this week in New London would not be done by then, and prosecutors said they are preparing for another trial scheduled for March.
Diamantis was found guilty by a jury in October of 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators in his role as head of the state school construction grants office. He remains free on a $500,000 bond.
Diamantis, Connecticut’s former deputy budget director and a former state legislator, was convicted of using his position overseeing the state’s school construction office to enrich himself and his family by accepting bribes from contractors on school projects in Hartford and Tolland.
Underhill delayed sentencing on that case until after the second trial, where he faces charges related to a Medicaid fraud scheme. Diamantis faces up to 12 years in prison for his October convictions.
Pattis had asked to be removed as Diamantis’ attorney last month, claiming that his client owed him at least $65,000, according to court records. Pattis and Diamantis appeared at a closed-door hearing before the U.S. Magistrate S. Dave Vatti last month to present their cases.
Vatti issued an eight-page ruling late Thursday afternoon just minutes before Underhill’s scheduled status conference with Pattis and federal prosecutors. 
“Diamantis’ failure to fulfill the $65,000 payment obligation is substantial under the circumstances,” Vatti wrote.
“He (Diamantis) objects that he has already paid nearly 75% of the total $250,000 fee and he argues that it is not uncommon for courts to deny requests to withdraw as criminal defense counsel where significant fees have already been paid, the client appears unable to make further payments, and substitute counsel would need time to catch up.”
But Vatti ruled Pattis was “not an indentured servant,” and forcing him to in effect represent Diamantis at a second trial for free was unfair.
Diamantis is facing bribery, extortion and filing false statement charges in the next trial, which centers around a $600,000 payment that Diamantis helped hand-deliver to another state agency to get a Medicaid audit of a Bristol eye doctor canceled.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Christopher Ziogas, also a former state representative, hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to the state Department of Social Services in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that the eye doctor Helen Zervas — Ziogas’ fiancée — improperly billed.

After that check was delivered to the Department of Social Services office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period.
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
But in November, Ziogas pleaded guilty to extortion and bribery charges for his part in pressuring state employees to cancel the audit. He admitted in court that he helped Zervas pay Diamantis $100,000 to help stifle the audit.

Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing 70 to 87 months in prison. Zervas also pleaded guilty, although a sentencing date has not yet been set.
While their plea agreements do not indicate that they must testify against Diamantis at his trial, Pattis has said he expects both of them will be witnesses for the government.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0228_SR_FederalCourtKosta_046-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 19:00:01.891722

Delaware officials have released an updated 2025 Climate Action Plan, outlining new long-term strategies to address climate and environmental concerns — even as state and federal data show Delaware already meets or exceeds most existing environmental standards.
The plan, finalized in early 2026, identifies transportation, industrial activity, and electrical power generation as the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the state. It sets a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and builds on Delaware’s first Climate Action Plan, released in 2021.
State leaders say the update is necessary to address long-term risks such as sea-level rise, rising temperatures, and more frequent severe storms. However, critics and policy observers question whether the new plan responds to regulatory necessity or advances broader policy objectives at a time when Delaware remains in full environmental compliance.
Air Quality Already Meets Federal Standards
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, Delaware currently meets all federal air-quality standards under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.
The state’s EPA-approved air-monitoring network tracks pollutants including ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. While particulate readings rose briefly in 2023 due to Canadian wildfire smoke, those incidents were classified as “exceptional events” and did not count against compliance.
Long-term emissions of major air pollutants continue to trend downward, consistent with national reductions driven by cleaner fuels, vehicle standards, and industrial controls.
Water Quality in Compliance, With Ongoing Restoration Efforts
Delaware’s water-quality standards are governed by the federal Clean Water Act and must be reviewed and approved by the EPA every three years. The state’s most recent update took effect Jan. 1, 2023.
DNREC reports Delaware meets federal monitoring and reporting requirements, though it continues long-term restoration efforts in specific watersheds, including the Inland Bays. These efforts operate under EPA-approved Total Maximum Daily Load plans and reflect ongoing improvement work rather than regulatory failure.
Climate Policy Already Exceeds Federal Requirements
Over the past five years, Delaware has adopted climate policies that exceed baseline federal requirements. The 2021 Climate Action Plan and the 2023 Climate Change Solutions Act established binding targets of a 50 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and net-zero emissions by 2050.
The state publishes annual implementation reports tracking progress on energy-efficiency programs, electric-vehicle incentives, and building standards. Federal law does not require states to adopt statutory emissions targets or formal climate-action plans.
“Climate change is real, and it is affecting Delaware and Delawareans in serious ways,” said Greg Patterson, secretary of DNREC. He said the updated plan focuses on practical outcomes such as cleaner air, reduced flooding, and improved land-use planning — benefits he said can deliver value regardless of one’s views on climate science.
“We are talking about strategies for cleaner air, more walkable communities, less flooding, more trees and forests, productive farmland, and higher-quality wetlands,” Patterson said.
Aligning With Progressive States — Not High-Growth States
Delaware’s net-zero strategy places the state alongside California, Colorado, Illinois, and Maryland, which have adopted similar long-term emissions mandates.
However, Jane Brady, chairperson of A Better Delaware, has noted that most of the nation’s fastest-growing states — including Florida, Texas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Arizona — are not pursuing net-zero mandates. Colorado is the lone exception among high-growth states.
Brady has argued that the contrast raises questions about whether net-zero strategies are driven more by political alignment than by demonstrated economic or population-growth outcomes.
“The states experiencing the strongest job and population growth are largely not pursuing net-zero mandates,” Brady has said, pointing out that Delaware already meets federal environmental standards and questioning whether additional climate policies will deliver measurable benefits relative to their costs.
Academic Skepticism on Local Climate Impacts
Some critics also point to statements from former University of Delaware climatologist David Legates, who has questioned whether current global-warming trends pose an immediate or existential threat to life in Delaware.
Legates, who served for decades as Delaware’s state climatologist, has argued that while climate conditions do change over time, there is limited evidence that recent warming trends are endangering human life in the First State. He has noted that challenges such as storms and coastal flooding are longstanding issues that have historically been addressed through infrastructure investment, land-use planning, and emergency preparedness rather than emissions mandates.
Legates has cautioned against framing climate change as a crisis requiring sweeping regulatory or economic action, emphasizing instead adaptation, resilience, and cost-benefit analysis — particularly in states like Delaware that already meet federal environmental standards.
Debate Shifts From Compliance to Policy Direction
Governor Matt Meyer said the updated plan is intended to protect residents while supporting job creation and long-term economic stability. He cited flooding, extreme rainfall, and urban heat as challenges already affecting communities.
Patterson emphasized that the Climate Action Plan is not a fixed mandate but a flexible framework, with scheduled updates in 2027 and 2029 ahead of the next full plan in 2030.
“Actions may change over time based on increased understanding of climate impacts, technology advancements, and stakeholder input,” he said.
With Delaware already meeting federal air and water standards — and exceeding baseline climate-planning expectations — the debate now centers less on environmental compliance and more on how aggressively the state should pursue additional climate policies, at what cost, and with what measurable return for taxpayers, businesses, and families.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01-TheMostPopularBeachesinCoastalDelaware.webp,,,2026-01-08 18:11:49.589037

The woman, 37-year-old Renee Good, was in Minneapolis as a neutral observer of ICE actions during protests of immigration enforcement following a mass deployment of ICE agents in the city.
Salinas’ bill would prohibit ICE personnel from going onto public school grounds and church properties without notice.
“No child or person should fear being abducted or risk having their family ripped apart when they leave their home,” Salinas said in a statement. “We are losing friends, neighbors, caretakers, and community members daily.”
Federal, state and local agencies, as well as the Tennessee National Guard, have been operating a Memphis Safe Task Force since September.
A researcher at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Salinas moved to America from Bolivia with her family when she was 7, and she has often spoken about the welcome they received while obtaining citizenship through a bipartisan bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican.
Salinas pointed out incidents such as the Minneapolis shooting death show “how lawless and dangerous” ICE interactions with the public have become.
“Now is the time that we as Tennesseans come together and to reject fear and violence and recognize our shared humanity. We are all children of God,” she said.
Salinas is likely to run into hurdles from the Republican supermajority as she tries to pass this legislation.
House Republican leaders are considering whether to bring back a bill that would allow public schools to check the citizenship status of all students and either block enrollment or charge tuition.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton said he plans to roll out a package of immigration-related bills.
Asked about the safe haven bill from ICE, Sexton called it “a terrible idea.”

Phil Murphy speaking at Ramsey High School on Jan. 8, 2026, before signing a bill that will ban cellphones in K-12 classrooms beginning next school year. (Photo by Jake Hirsch/Governor’s Office.)
New Jersey public school districts will be required to bar their students from using cellphones and other smart devices during school hours under a bill signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy Thursday.
Murphy, a Democrat whose second term ends on Jan. 20, had made banning phones during class a priority of his final year in office. He signed the bill during a ceremony in Ramsey High School, where classrooms have been phone-free for a year already.
Murphy said that within four months of Ramsey High School’s cellphone ban, nearly 80% of teachers reported increased engagement in class and a majority of the faculty observed greater student-to-student interaction, fewer classroom distractions, and more attentive students.
“When you talk to educators and parents in school districts that have enacted similar cellphone bans, you will often hear the same thing. Students are more focused, they’re less anxious, and they are socializing and laughing with each other, not through a screen, but in the hallways and classrooms. So with the legislation I’m signing today, we’re going to fundamentally improve the learning environment for every K-through-12 student by requiring every school district to follow the lead of campuses just like this one,” he said.
Under the new law, the state’s education commission will be required to develop guidelines on restricting the use of cellphones and other internet-enabled devices during regular school hours, on a bus, or during certain school-sanctioned events. Boards of education will then be required to adopt policies consistent with the state guidelines.
The state guidelines will be required to be written within 90 days so the new policies can go into place by the start of the 2026-27 school year.
Students will be able to use their phones in case of an emergency, for translation services, and in cases where the school receives documentation from a health care professional indicating that access to a phone is necessary.
Principals and administrators will also be allowed to make reasonable accommodations for students to use phones for educational purposes.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D-Essex) is the school superintendent in East Newark, where students have had to surrender their cellphones during the school day for the last five years.
“I’ve heard it from students about the state, that even though it’s hard to let go of the device, that they are thankful for the time that they have in school that they don’t have to worry about it anymore. That they don’t have to compete for the attention. That they don’t have to compete with news of what’s happening in the moment,” Bagolie said.
About 16 states have approved “bell-to-bell” cellphone bans in classrooms.
Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, who takes office at noon on Jan. 20, commended Murphy for signing the bill. During her campaign for governor, Sherrill also said she wanted to limit phones in schools.
“Our young people are facing a mental health crisis — but, we all know that when children put the screens down, their mental health and academic results improve,” Sherrill said in a statement. “I look forward to implementing this important legislation and continuing to make progress on kids’ online safety and holding Big Tech accountable for the content they push toward our kids.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nonpartisan U.S. Senate candidate Dan Osborn raised $762,000 in the last quarter of 2025, bringing his campaign total for last year to more than $2 million, his team told the Examiner. 
While fundraising reports are still being finalized with the Federal Election Commission, Osborn had 11,857 individual donors in the last quarter, with an average contribution of roughly $37, the campaign says. The Osborn camp says the numbers show the former labor leader is running a “stronger campaign” than his closer-than-expected loss to U.S. Sen Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2024. 
Osborn, who has said he is not accepting donations from corporate political action committees but not from union PACs, said his campaign is being “backed by working-class people.” 
Osborn is currently in a heated campaign against Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts. Osborn gained national attention for his 2024 bid against Fischer, who beat him by six percentage points in a state where Republicans outnumber Democrats roughly 2 to 1, and nonpartisans make up a growing share of the electorate.

“Pete Ricketts is a billionaire whose war chest will be bankrolled by deep-pocketed corporate interests,” Osborn said. “We have always known that. We have the people behind us, we will always outwork him, and that’s why we will win this U.S. Senate seat.”

Ricketts and his team are trying to paint Osborn as a “fake independent,” pointing to his having received donations and support from Democrats and using fundraising infrastructure often used by Democrats. They’ve also criticized him for paying himself and his wife using campaign funds, which is legal but often comes at a political price.
Will Coup, Ricketts campaign spokesperson, said Osborn is releasing his topline numbers to “avoid scrutiny of what’s actually in his report.”
“Did Osborn continue self-dealing by paying thousands of dollars to a shell company owned by his wife? Did he accept even more funding from Elizabeth Warren and members of the Soros family?” Coup said. “Once again, Fake Dan Osborn is trying to hide his self-dealing, his donors, and his liberal policies from Nebraskans.”

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Mike Foley is seeking another four-year term as Nebraska auditor of public accounts, embracing a job designed to help root out fraud, inefficiency and misuse of government resources.
At 71, Foley’s political career in Nebraska has spanned a quarter century, starting as a state senator representing south Lincoln in 2001. In the Legislature, he was a social conservative who often emphasized his opposition to abortion. He was also criticized by some for pressing his faith into public positions.
Nebraska State Auditor’s Office. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)
After six years making laws, the Republican won back-to-back terms as state auditor. He ran for governor in the 2014 election and lost in the primary to Pete Ricketts, who later named Foley as his running mate, which led to an eight-year stint as lieutenant governor.
Foley then chose to take another shot at the auditor’s post and voters returned him to the office in 2023. After filing paperwork this week for what would be a fourth term as auditor, though not all consecutive, Foley told the Nebraska Examiner he hadn’t seriously considered any other job.
“I enjoy this work. It’s a good fit for me,” he said. “We have a great team and I think we’re making a difference.”
The auditor provides independent investigations of financial activities of state and local governments. Oversight extends to about 2,700 entities and agencies, Foley said. Findings go to policymakers and taxpayers via reports and Internet-based budget and audit databases.
Foley earned his undergraduate degree from State University of New York at Brockport and a master’s degree from Michigan State University.
Before moving to Nebraska, Foley lived two decades in Washington D.C., where he was director of financial analysis for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. He and his wife Susan have six children and four grandchildren.
Foley said he aims to be impartial and “calls it as I see it,” regardless of who is involved.
“I wasn’t hired to look the other way when I find problems,” he said.

Luckert is retiring from the state's highest court. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Supreme Court Justice Eric Rosen formally stepped into the job of chief justice Thursday by framing the delicate work of the state’s highest court as a crucial public service and proclaiming the citizenry’s diversity of perspective strengthened the rule of law rather than challenged it.
Rosen, who joined the Supreme Court in 2005 after serving a dozen years as a Shawnee County District Court judge, said the rule of law endured not because it was rigid but because its principles could be applied fairly in response to the blended reality of people.
“Over the last 20 years, I have learned that the role of this court is both modest and profound,” he said. “We do not make public policy nor do we do we chase public approval. The oath I swore to you today commands our duty is to interpret and apply the law faithfully, to safeguard constitutional privileges and principles and ensure that justice is administered without fear or favor.”
Rosen said the Supreme Court had to be mindful that the court’s decisions impact the lives of 3 million Kansans and shaped public trust in the judicial branch.
“It is a lived reality that people who come before our courts seek fairness and justice,” Rosen said. “It is complemented by a broader richness of viewpoints and backgrounds that strengthens public trust and deepens our understanding of the law’s impact.”
Rosen was the first Jewish person appointed a district court judge in Kansas and the first in state history to serve on the Supreme Court. He also became Kansas’ first Jewish chief justice. He said he was mindful that being Jewish set him apart in ways that at times were isolating and limiting, but reaching each personal legal milestone wasn’t about distinction for its own sake.
“Equal justice under the law is not self-executed. It requires vigilance. It requires humility and a continued commitment to ensuring that our institutions truly belong to everyone they serve,” Rosen said.
Rosen transitioned to acting chief justice in October after Chief Justice Marla Luckert suffered a stroke. On Jan. 1, Rosen assumed the role of chief justice upon Luckert’s resignation from the position. Rosen moved into the job because of a provision of the Kansas Constitution reserving that role for the justice with the most continuous years of service to the court.
Rosen praised Luckert’s tenure as chief justice and told an audience of about 225 people in the Kansas Judicial Center that he appreciated her steady leadership, integrity and commitment to fairness.
He said the Supreme Court had a duty to honor Luckert’s adherence to principles of thoughtful deliberation, respect for different views and an understanding that justice wasn’t static but something that must be tended with care.
“It’s a bittersweet moment for me to embrace my new charge while preparing to wish a close professional colleague and friend a wonderful, well-earned retirement,” Rosen said.
Luckert, who plans to soon retire from the Supreme Court, said she had worked with Rosen for three decades in the district and appellate courts and recognized he “guarded the principles of fair and equal justice for all litigants.” She said people appearing before Rosen were treated with dignity and assured their disputes would be resolved impartially.
Libby Rosen, the chief justice’s wife, introduced her husband and recalled his pursuit of a dream to leave a career as a school social worker to become a lawyer. He went to law school part-time while raising a family, which offered him important lessons in the precision of words. She recalled Rosen asked his 3-year-old son, who was eating an apple, if he could have a bite.
“Eric paused for a second and went over and bit his father,” she said.
Libby Rosen said that after more than 50 years together the state’s chief justice had shown he was a “calm, fair and reasoned partner as long as it didn’t concern technology.”
She said the couple recently began a daily habit of playing Wordle. She said her skills as a nurse led her to finish faster than her husband. The chief justice, however, was deliberative and considered all angles before advancing in each stage of the game, she said.
“He takes much longer to do it, but he gets it right in fewer tries,” Libby Rosen said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Luckert-and-Rosen-4-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

A key Senate committee on Thursday advanced four bills that would give communities more leeway to soften the blow of sudden tax increases. Two of the bills are authored by senators representing Boston who have drawn Wu’s ire for not backing her approach.
The bills are set for a vote on Thursday, January 15, according to a Senate official, as is another measure that would require ballot question committees to more frequently disclose their fundraising and spending.
The sudden movement of the tax bills sets the stage for another round of finger-pointing and political elbowing about the growing burden of residential property taxes in the state’s capital.
As homeowners faced a series of steep increases, Wu tried on several occasions to secure permission from Beacon Hill to temporarily shift some of the burden to businesses. Her plan had buy-in from the House, but it never gained traction in the Senate and then became a vector for renewed cross-branch tension.
After Wu made her latest ill-fated pitch in December, Senate leaders instead began to move a pair of bills from Sen. Nick Collins of South Boston and Sen. Will Brownsberger of Belmont, whose district also includes part of Boston, taking aim at local property-tax issues.
One of those bills that earned the Senate Ways and Means Committee’s approval Thursday would allow communities to create a “tax shock credit,” designed to ease the impact when a residential property tax levy is set to increase more than 10 percent in a single year. Officials say the relief would be targeted to “the most vulnerable taxpayers,” including taxpayers who have a child 6 years old or younger residing at the home in question, people 65 years or older who own and occupy their homes, and households where a member is enrolled in MassHealth.
The other bill would launch an opt-in rebate program providing an added credit to taxpayers who received the residential tax exemption in the prior year for an owner-occupied property.
Senate President Karen Spilka said the slate ready for action, which also includes two others bills that deal with senior property tax deferrals and exemptions, “puts more tools into the toolboxes of municipalities across the state to give a break to the taxpayers most in need.”
Fueled in large part by a post-pandemic shift to remote work, commercial property values in Boston have plummeted in recent years. That in turn has forced more of the city’s property tax burden onto homeowners, who are alreadystaring down major increases to tax bills that arrive in January.
Even with a Senate vote set for next week, it’s unclear when or even whether the new relief measures will become law. House leaders remain frustrated with the approach the Senate took to Wu’s plan, and they appear skeptical about the Brownsberger-Collins alternatives.
Asked last month if the House had any interest in taking up those Senate’s bills, House Speaker Ron Mariano — who at the time was perched near a third-floor ledge in the State House — quipped, “This may cause me to jump.”
The Senate was “critical of the mayor not giving out enough notice” ahead of her latest tax-shift proposal, Mariano said, according to State House News Service. “These guys pulled these bills right out of their back pocket. So I think that we need to understand what their bills do.”
The dust-up is still producing political fallout. Wu last month called out Collins for not supporting her prior version of the tax-shift plan. Meanwhile, Daniel Lander, a senior policy adviser to Wu, in December launched a Democratic primary challenge against Brownsberger.
While Wu has not weighed in on the race, Lander cited Brownsberger’s opposition to the mayor’s tax plan as a reason he decided to run, according to the Dorchester Reporter.
The 2026 elections are also a key theme in the other major bill the Senate teed up for a vote next week.
That proposal, originally filed by Sen. Sal DiDomenico of Everett, would require campaigns pushing statewide ballot questions to submit reports at least once per month, with a bit more frequency closer to the election.
Current law is notoriously lax when it comes to financial disclosures for ballot questions, whose backers and opponents regularly spend millions or tens of millions of dollars trying to sway voters on impactful policy changes.
In 2026, ballot question campaigns do not need to file their next reports until September, allowing influential and well-funded groups to obscure how much money they are pumping into their efforts — and who their backers are — until just a couple of months before the election.
Lawmakers are growing increasingly skeptical of the ballot question process, which is often used by advocates as political leverage on issues that the Legislature does not want to touch.
As many as 12 statewide questions remain in the running to appear before voters this fall, which would smash the previous record of nine questions in a single election. They cover a wide range of thorny topics, such as whether to cut the state’s income tax rate, impose a strict cap on rents across Massachusetts, and repeal the decade-old voter authorization for recreational marijuana.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12-03_transit_worker_bill_signing_2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican legislative leaders agreed to pay former Emporia State University president Ken Hush $50,000 to spearhead their efforts to slash spending at public universities.
The five Republican members of the Legislative Coordinating Council, over objections from the panel’s two Democrats, approved a contract Thursday to pay Hush $10,000 per month for five months to be a consultant to the Legislature on higher education budgets. The committee members didn’t mention Hush by name while discussing the deal, but Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, confirmed it was Hush after the meeting.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, said Hush would be tasked with finding “efficiencies” in university budgets while the Legislature works to cut annual state spending by $200 million.
Hush retired last month after leading ESU for more than three years. As president, he fired tenured professors without due process and eliminated and added programs without explanation. The so-called “ESU model” cratered student enrollment and required a pair of $9 million bailouts from the Legislature. An investigation by the American Association of University Professors concluded he was unfit to lead.
Hawkins — Hush’s fraternity brother in the early 1980s at ESU — praised Hush’s leadership at ESU during the Thursday meeting.
“He has intimate insight into the higher ed budget arena, and certainly, as everybody knows, we have to be very careful and prudent with the dollars in our budget,” Hawkins said.
The Kansas Board of Regents already initiated plans to evaluate programs and faculty members at the state’s six public universities, and dismiss those who fail to meet expectations. In a brief exchange with reporters, Masterson said the effort was “helpful,” but that he wasn’t sure if it would go far enough. He supported the contract with Hush.
“It’s just valuable to have somebody who’s run a university be able to consult you on some of that, because those are vast budgets with multiple revenue sources,” Masterson said. “It’s gonna be well worth a few dollars spent. And” — he paused to bump this reporter’s shoulder — “we didn’t have a special session this year.”
The comment was in reference to GOP leaders’ failed plans to hold a special session in November 2025 to try to gerrymander U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat, out of office. The LCC had allotted $460,000 to fund the special session.
Rep. Blake Carpenter, right, says he has found $100 million in questionable spending by state universities. House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard listens during a Jan. 8, 2026, meeting of the Legislative Coordinating Council. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Rep. Blake Carpenter, R-Derby, said he supported the move to hire Hush because he and his staff already identified $100 million in what he considered to be “questionable spending” by universities. He said their findings included $75,000 “in travel reimbursements to a vanilla bean manufacturing tour guide in Africa,” $96,000 “to a nutritionist guru specializing in vegan cookbooks,” and $111,000 “to a social justice head-hunting firm specializing in placing executives into leadership positions and nonprofits.”
“So I think that if we’re able to find about $100 million just on our own over the interim with my staff and I looking through these line items, then I think it makes a lot of sense for us to hire an executive that has run one of these universities,” Carpenter said. “They know how they operate, and they can give specific details as to where and how we can be more efficient with these higher education systems. And I think the $100 million at this point is scratching the surface, and we need to continue to dig.”
Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes and House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard, both Lenexa Democrats, questioned whether Hush’s work would duplicate the work of the Legislature’s existing budget analysts and research staff.
Sykes also questioned the transparency of handing a costly, no-bid contract to an unnamed consultant without making the plan public in advance of Thursday’s meeting.
“I find it interesting with all the talk we have about finding efficiency in government, and I think we keep growing government, honestly,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1080325-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

The airline’s decision to end the immigration charters was part of a broader financial restructuring that the company unveiled earlier in the week.
Activists in Maryland last summer and fall pressured the state government to end its contract with Avelo at BWI, in protest of the ICE deportation flights taking place across the country and President Donald Trump’s immigration policies more generally. Maryland groups targeting Avelo collected thousands of petition signatures, urging Gov. Wes Moore (D) to cancel the state’s contract with the airline.
Similar protests have been taking place all over the country, in cities where Avelo runs flights.
But the Moore administration, which has criticized Trump’s immigration policies, asserted that the state had no power over any ICE flights out of BWI and did not seek to end its contract with Avelo.
Avelo and Maryland signed a deal in 2022 for the carrier to run a limited number of flights to and from other U.S. cities in and out of BWI, the state-owned airport. The contract enables the state or the airline to walk away with 30 days’ notice.
Even if Maryland had ended its arrangement with Avelo for commercial flights at BWI, that would not have prevented Avelo or other carriers from running detainee flights out of the airport.

The data, released by the Oklahoma State Department of Health on Thursday, shows a drop of over 7% in positive influenza cases and 40 fewer hospitalizations during the week of Dec. 28, which is the most recently available data.
The drop followed a spike in positive flu cases and hospitalizations over the Christmas holiday week. 
Positive cases hit a peak of nearly 22% positivity during the week of Dec. 21, according to a flu data dashboard operated by the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Hospitalizations also peaked that week, reaching 165, according to the dashboard. 
Erica Rankin, a spokesperson for the Health Department, said one week of fluctuation is too early to say if cases are truly decreasing. 
Rankin said this week’s dip could be due to a shift in the number of people visiting the doctor or a change in provider reporting with offices having altered hours during the holidays. 
“We have observed an increase in the influenza percent positivity rate in many areas of the state, along with many states across the country,” Rankin said. “This is what we would expect to see this time of year, being in the middle of respiratory season.”
Nationally, the most recent CDC data shows flu cases are elevated and the number of cases continues to increase in most states.
A majority of Oklahoma’s confirmed positive flu cases are a subset of Influenza A strain. Known as the H3N2 subtype, health officials have said the strain is more resistant to the flu shot. 
Rankin said it isn’t too late to get the flu shot. 
“We would encourage individuals to speak with their trusted health care provider to determine if the flu shot is right for them and to bring any concerns or questions they may have to them,” she said in a statement. “Even if the flu shot is not a perfect match to the strain circulating, it can still help to reduce the severity of illness someone may get from the flu.”
The flu dashboard is updated every Thursday, excluding state holidays, using data from the previous Sunday through Saturday.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/advocates-federal-cutbacks-could-cost-ct-nearly-1-billion/,"Connecticut Voices for Children projects the impending financial hit at nearly $1 billion, more than double the $500 million emergency fund.","For the first time since Congress and President Donald Trump slashed health care and nutrition assistance last July, Connecticut legislators heard a projection of how much the state stands to lose next fiscal year.
It wasn’t pretty.
Connecticut Voices for Children, a New Haven-based policy group, used its 25th annual Tax and Budget Forum Thursday to project the impending financial hit at nearly $1 billion, more than double the $500 million emergency fund legislators created in special session to offset vanishing aid from Washington.
The progressive research organization also offered numerous options to mitigate forces it says are pushing thousands of Connecticut residents into poverty or farther below subsistence levels.
The General Assembly could pump hundreds of millions into health care and food assistance by boosting taxes on the wealthy households that are chief beneficiaries of new federal tax cuts financed with human service program cuts, the organization reported.
But, given 2026 is a state election year and tax hikes are unpopular, lawmakers and Gov. Ned Lamont also could achieve similar results by curbing aggressive state savings policies and by working harder to collect the nearly $4 billion in unpaid taxes Connecticut misses out on annually.
“The income and wealth divides are widening by the day, and it’s on full display when some of the most powerful people and corporations are profiting … while many of our neighbors have no choice but to visit a food pantry to feed their families,” Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices, said to open the online forum.
General Assembly must solve next CT budget in February
Since Trump and the GOP-led Congress ordered more than $1 trillion in cuts to various human service programs over the next decade to finance $4.5 trillion in tax relief, Connecticut officials have been waiting to learn how big the local hit would be.
Lamont’s budget staff was supposed to issue projections this fall but did not do so, saying it should wait until after Congress resolves the next federal budget — something that still hasn’t happened.
But the General Assembly must begin revising state finances for the 2026-27 fiscal year when its next regular session starts on Feb. 4. State lawmakers have been bracing for the worst.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, who has pressed the Lamont administration repeatedly for its analysis of the congressional fiscal mega-bill, said the Connecticut Voices’ tally seems on the mark.
That $1 billion gap reflects not only cuts to Medicaid and to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, but also vanishing federal tax assistance to families that purchase health insurance offered through the state exchange.
Connecticut Voices’ analysts assume about 150,000 state residents would lose health insurance, either because policies on the exchange have become unaffordable or due to cuts in federal Medicaid funding.
And though the state Department of Social Services estimated as many as 36,000 residents here would become ineligible for SNAP benefits by March 31 because of new work requirements and other rules changes Congress ordered in July, other changes will continue to tighten the program over the coming decade. By the early 2030s, Connecticut Voices estimates those removed from the program here will approach 58,000.
Considering both cuts to human service programs and federal tax relief, the poorest 20% of households are estimated to lose more than $1,600, on average, in annual resources, while the richest 10% are projected to gain more than $9,200, Connecticut Voices’ analysts project.
The General Assembly this fall set aside $500 million from last fiscal year’s $2.5 billion surplus to backfill vanishing federal aid in certain human service programs. Lamont already has directed $168 million from that fund to assist food pantries, Planned Parenthood and programs to combat homelessness. The administration also dedicated another $70 million to mitigate cutbacks in federal assistance for health insurance premiums.
Lamont’s direct control over the $500 million ends when the General Assembly reconvenes Feb. 4, but Ritter said he expects lawmakers will continue working with the governor to spend the rest of those funds, and possibly more, to soften the harshest cuts to human service programs.
“We have, I think, a responsibility to do the best we can to help our residents,” the speaker said, adding he remains hopeful that if Democrats gain control of at least one chamber of Congress during the November 2026 elections, some of the federal budget policies can be reversed.
Report: Poverty was growing in CT before federal cuts
Connecticut Voices argues in its report that Connecticut’s middle class had been slipping closer to poverty — and its poor falling even further — well before last July.
Over the past three years, the share of Connecticut residents living in or near poverty ticked up from 21.8% to 22.8%, according to the Supplemental Poverty Measure, a metric that considers not only household income and expenses but also public assistance benefits.
That is aligned with findings reported last September by the United Way of Connecticut, which found a record-high 581,000 Connecticut households, about 40%, couldn’t afford a basic “survival” budget in 2023.
“If the state does not act, and holding all other factors constant, the new federal policies will lead to even more low- and middle-income households struggling to make ends meet and higher poverty rates,” Connecticut Voices’ research and policy director, Patrick O’Brien, wrote in his report for the forum.
Connecticut is home to some of the most extreme income and wealth inequality in the country.
The top 1% of households nationally, or those who earn more than $730,000 per year according to CNBC, have an average income of $2.27 million per year, about 127 times the average earnings of the poorest 20%, which is $17,870, O’Brien said.  
But in Connecticut the top 1% enjoy a much wider gap, averaging $3.66 million in yearly income or almost 183 times that of the $20,050 earned by the poorest 20%. 
CT could tax the rich – or save less – to help poor and middle class
Given that taxpayers with incomes topping $500,000 per year are slated to receive one-third of the entire federal tax break — which is paid for, in part, with deep cuts to assistance programs — Connecticut Voices’ officials repeated recommendations they’ve made in several recent forums for state tax hikes on some the highest earners.
Adding or adjusting business tax surcharges could raise as much as $110 million per year.
Similarly, placing a surcharge on the capital gains-related earnings of households with overall income that exceeds $500,000 per year would generate $235 million.
Raising the effective tax rate on Connecticut’s largest estates could collect up to an extra $70 million.
And if state officials don’t want to talk tax hikes while running for reelection this year, there are other ways to raise funds, O’Brien noted.
The state has used an aggressive series of budget caps to force unprecedented surpluses since 2017. Unspent dollars have averaged more than $1.8 billion annually over the last eight years, a huge total that represents 8% to 9% of the General Fund. One cap alone that restricts legislators’ ability to spend certain income and business tax receipts has captured an average of $1.5 billion per year.
Connecticut has used those dollars to bolster its reserves and whittle down its pension debt, which still exceeds $33 billion, according to Lamont’s budget office.
Many Democrats in the legislature have criticized the caps in recent years, arguing they force excessive surpluses and draw needed funds from health care, education, municipal aid and other core programs.
Connecticut Voices’ analysts say moving between $925 million or more from this savings program and into the budget would eliminate the need for any tax hikes.
They also note the state projects a $3.7 billion annual “tax gap” that reflects the difference between what is owed and collected. If Connecticut were to increase auditing staff sufficient to reduce that gap by even 10%, it would provide almost $400 million extra annually to mitigate losses in federal aid.
But minority Republicans in the General Assembly, as well as many moderate Democrats, are expected to fight many of these proposals.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, said Thursday that his caucus still favors a major state income tax cut aimed solely at Connecticut’s middle class. The House GOP in October pitched increasing an income tax credit that offsets local property tax bills by as much as $700 per filer.
But Candelora said Republicans aren’t looking to boost taxes on any households or businesses at this time and added Connecticut officials should try to find efficiencies in the existing state budget if they want to identify money to offset federal cutbacks to human service programs.
Lamont, a moderate Democrat, has steadfastly opposed increasing taxes on Connecticut’s wealthy, including finance investments in social programs, arguing that doing so would prompt higher earners to flee the state.
The governor also has been wary about changing any of Connecticut’s budget caps, despite complaints from his fellow Democrats in the legislature.
Lamont did sign the first major state income tax rate cut into law three years ago, which gave middle class families about $300 per year. And his budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, noted the governor recently secured legislative approval for a new endowment to dramatically expand affordable child care, largely by using state surplus dollars.
Collibee didn’t comment on specific proposals from Connecticut Voices but added that “Gov. Lamont is eager to hear any thoughtful ideas that can help make life more affordable for Connecticut families.”
Byrne said that “affordability” is a popular buzz word “that politicians feel compelled to say,” adding that it’s unclear which households’ budgets leaders are trying to assist.
“While the state may not have created the chaos we’re experiencing, it owns it now,” Byrne added. “And so the choices made by elected [state officials] will determine whether federal harms are made worse or mitigated.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0203_SR_HousingPolicy051-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468
,DC,2026-01-08 22:19:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US House backs extension of health insurance subsidies after Dems force vote,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-backs-extension-health-insurance-subsidies-after-dems-force-vote,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. House approved a bipartisan bill Thursday to resurrect the enhanced tax credits that expired at the end of last year for people who purchase their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.The 230-196 vote sends the legislation to the Senate, where Republican leadership is unlikely to put it on the floor without considerable changes, which a bipartisan group of senators appears close to finalizing. Seventeen Republicans voted with every Democrat to pass the bill. House GOP leaders didn’t want to bring the bill up in their chamber, but a handful of their own members signed a discharge petition in December, forcing the vote amid rising health care costs. Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern said during floor debate on Wednesday evening “it’s about damn time” the chamber took up a bill to address the now-expired tax credits, arguing lawmakers have a “moral obligation to act” to help people afford health insurance.“This Congress musters up the will to spend trillions of dollars on tax breaks for billionaires and to send the Pentagon billions of dollars more than they even asked for. And the administration came up with tens of billions of dollars to bail out Argentina, for God’s sake,” McGovern said. “But somehow helping moms and dads, grandparents and kids afford trips to the doctor is a step too far for this Republican leadership.”New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler said he only backed the bill after Republican leaders declined to bring up a bipartisan two-year compromise bill he helped negotiate last year. “I am voting in favor of this discharge and of this legislation to send it to the Senate so that the Senate will have the opportunity to put forth a reform package that can pass Congress and become law,” Lawler said. Republicans and Democrats, he said, agree that the country’s health care system is in need of a serious overhaul. He called on his colleagues to find solutions to the bigger, more structural issues. “Enough of the blame game on both sides,” Lawler said. “Let’s focus on actually delivering affordable health care for Americans.”Prolonged fight over ACA tax credits Democrats originally established the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credits during the coronavirus pandemic in an attempt to get more people health insurance coverage. They set the subsidies to expire at the end of 2025.The debate over the sunset date simmered in the background for much of last year but surged to the forefront in October after Democrats shut down the government and repeatedly demanded GOP leaders negotiate an extension to the expiring enhanced tax credits.The shutdown ended in mid-November after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., agreed to give Democrats a vote on a health care bill of their choosing in December. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ultimately decided to bring up a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits without any changes, but it failed to get the 60 votes needed to advance.A proposal from Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, both Republicans, that would have provided funding through Health Savings Accounts for some ACA marketplace enrollees during 2026 and 2027 also failed to move toward final passage. A House Republican health care bill passed that chamber last month, but doesn’t have the bipartisan support to move through the Senate and become law. Senate problemsThune said Tuesday any renewal of the enhanced ACA marketplace subsidies would need reforms to move through that chamber.The bill, he said, would need to set income limits on who qualifies for the enhanced tax credit and eliminate ACA health insurance plans that have $0 premiums, a feature Republicans allege allowed insurance companies to enroll people without their knowledge to receive the subsidy. “And then the second component would be some sort of a bridge to (Health Savings Accounts). An expansion of HSAs so that you're getting more money into the pockets of the American people, the patients, if you will, the consumers, as opposed to insurance companies,” Thune said. “And then finally you've got to deal with the Hyde issue.”The Hyde Amendment has been a feature of government spending bills for decades, preventing federal dollars from going to abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape, or incest, or threatens the woman’s life. Republicans want the prohibition to apply to all ACA marketplace health insurance plans without any way for Americans to pay for the coverage themselves, the way they do now. Democrats have rejected the change as a non-starter that would restrict abortion access in blue states. ‘Be a little flexible on Hyde,’ says TrumpPresident Donald Trump waded into that debate this week, telling House Republicans during a policy retreat at the Kennedy Center they must be “flexible” about the Hyde Amendment in order to broker a health care deal that can reach his desk. ""You have to be a little flexible on Hyde. You know that. You’ve got to be a little flexible,” Trump said. “You’ve got to work something. You’ve got to use ingenuity. You’ve got to work. We’re all big fans of everything, but you’ve got to have flexibility.""Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser rebuked Trump for the comment, writing in a statement that to “suggest Republicans should be ‘flexible’ is an abandonment of this decades-long commitment. If Republicans abandon Hyde, they are sure to lose this November.”States have a patchwork of laws addressing abortion coverage in ACA  marketplace health insurance plans, with 25 prohibiting coverage with certain exceptions and 12 requiring abortion coverage, according to analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.“In states that do not bar coverage of abortions on plans available through the Marketplace, insurers may offer a plan that covers abortions beyond the permissible Hyde amendment situations when the pregnancy is a result of rape, or incest or the pregnant person’s life is endangered, but this coverage cannot be paid with federal dollars.”Any ACA marketplace health insurance plan that offers abortion coverage in circumstances outside those three exceptions must charge each enrollee $1 for that coverage, according to KFF.Behind the scenes in the SenateA bipartisan group of senators has been talking behind the scenes for months about how to extend the ACA marketplace subsidies with changes. Ohio Republican Sen. Bernie Moreno said Thursday he expects the group, which has agreed on a “framework,” to release a bill next week, though he cautioned that’s just one small step. “We have agreement that we think we have a skeleton of a deal. But it's all fun and games until you have it on paper in a bill form,” Moreno said. “So we have to do that. And then we have to go sell the heck out of it to our conference. And again, look, this is politics. There's people on both sides that want this to fail. So we have to get past that massive mountain.”

Moreno said the tentative plan is to revive the enhanced ACA marketplace tax credit for another two years with modifications.The bill would also: Extend open enrollment for this year until March 1.Cap the enhanced subsidy for people making under 700% of the federal poverty level, or about $109,550 in annual income for one person, according to the guidelines for 2025.Require people eligible for the enhanced tax credit to pay at least $5 per month or $60 per year for their health insurance to ensure the enrollee knows about their coverage.Fine insurance companies $1,000 for “deliberately causing fraud, meaning signing someone up without their consent.”ACA marketplace enrollees eligible for the enhanced tax credit would have a choice in 2027 to either keep the lower premium that stems from the health insurance company receiving the subsidy, or move to a Health Savings Account where they would receive the money from the government. “The final piece, which I think is the biggest sweetener to the whole deal, is putting back in place cost-sharing reduction payments, which, according to (the Congressional Budget Office), reduce premiums for everybody in the exchange by 11% and save the federal government money,” Moreno said, later clarifying that would happen in 2027.  There is not yet a final proposal regarding how ACA marketplace plans handle abortion coverage in states where it's allowed, he said. The handshake agreement, Moreno said, is intended to give Congress time to overhaul the bigger issues facing the country’s health insurance and health care systems in a way that reduces costs.Gang of negotiatorsMoreno said the core group of negotiators, which he nicknamed the EPTCOG gang on his text chain, includes six Democrats and five of his Republican Senate colleagues. There are 24 senators total in the “extended OG” gang. Moreno believes one of his advantages in the negotiations is that he hasn’t been around the Senate that long, having just been elected in 2024. He said senators are also handling the details themselves, instead of deferring much of the work to staff. “This has been principals only. We don't even allow staff in meetings,” Moreno said. “And the idea is if we can't work it out, there's really no point in tasking this with staff.”New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the negotiators, said Wednesday she wasn’t aware of a deadline for the negotiators to release a bill. She also brushed aside the possibility of changes to how the ACA handles abortion coverage. “There is no need to come to a compromise because it's already been dealt with in the Affordable Care Act,” Shaheen said. “There is very specific language on how it is dealt with. And I think that applies to whatever happens with the Affordable Care Act.”Shaheen said Thursday the House vote “provides momentum” for Senate negotiators.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

The No. 2 Republican in the Vermont House, Rep. Casey Toof of St. Albans Town, will resign his seat next week. Toof has served as assistant minority leader since 2023 and has represented his Franklin County town in the chamber since 2019.
The 40-year-old said he’s leaving the House after starting a new job in November as town manager of St. Albans Town. He and his wife also had a third child last July, he said; the combination of the job’s workload, and a larger family, has meant he’s had less time to devote to legislating.
“Working five minutes from home is a lot easier for me to justify than driving to Montpelier every day,” he said Thursday.

Toof has spent his entire tenure assigned to the House Education Committee. Last year, he was one of the voices pushing Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s priorities during the fierce debate over lawmakers’ sweeping education reform plan, Act 73. Toof said the fact that many of the law’s key provisions are still to be hashed out made his decision to leave the Statehouse this year more difficult.
Toof’s resignation does not take effect until Jan. 16, but House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, has already moved him off the education committee. She replaced him with another representative, Milton GOP Rep. Leland Morgan, on Tuesday. Toof was moved, somewhat ceremonially, to the House Agriculture, Food Resiliency, and Forestry Committee.
Toof said the shuffling, which he supported, would allow Morgan to participate in some of the education panel’s introductory hearings this week focused on Act 73 and its next steps.
Scott has not yet named Toof’s replacement. Toof’s House leadership role has already been filled, however, by Rep. Mark Higley, R-Lowell, who previously served as second assistant minority leader, Higley said Thursday.
Rep. Tom Burditt, R-Rutland, now has Higley’s old job, Higley said.
In addition to serving in the House, Toof managed Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers’ winning campaign for that office in 2024.
Toof is set to be the fourth House member to resign since the end of the 2025 session in June. Jim Harrison, a Chittenden Republican, stepped down Tuesday; Heather Surprenant, a Barnard Democrat, resigned in September; and Mari Cordes, a Bristol Democrat, resigned in June.

Kelly Ayotte speaks at the Executive Council meeting on Jan. 7, 2026. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire child care providers are being urged not to panic by state officials and lawmakers as news spreads that the Trump administration froze federal child care subsidies in five Democratic states earlier this week. 
At an Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, Councilor Joseph Kenney of Wakefield questioned Lori Weaver, commissioner for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, for an update on the status of the state’s federal funding for child care, despite it not being on the agenda. 
“We have not had any of our child care [funding] cut,” Weaver said. “There’s a lot of media out there to do about Minnesota, and there’s been talk of that, but we are still doing business as usual right now. We have no official word, no notice.” 
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also announced a rule-change proposal for the Child Care Development Fund, the primary source of federal child care funding in New Hampshire. 
If approved, the proposal would allow states to change how payments to child care programs are calculated, from the number of children enrolled to the number of children in attendance each day or week. It would also remove the requirement for states to pay child care providers upfront for care subsidies and reinstate parent-directed vouchers. 
Karen Hebert, director of the division of economic stability, told the council that the department “hasn’t had any changes” to its payment processes and that the proposal could take “weeks or months” to be approved. 
She said if the proposal gets approved, the state Department of Health and Human Services “would then take whatever steps we need to comply with those changes.” 
Providers have said that a change in how payments are distributed could be costly for programs and the families they serve. 
Gov. Kelly Ayotte reaffirmed the importance of the Child Care Scholarship Program, which is funded by the Child Care Development Fund, after the council meeting. 
“I can tell you, the Child Care Scholarship Program is really important to me,” Ayotte said. “We have federal money, but also often have some state portion. So we tend to look at things very carefully.” 
Ayotte also said she and Weaver discuss fraud “all the time,” and that New Hampshire “is not Minnesota.” 
Providers were also briefed directly about what is going on at the federal level.
In a meeting with child care providers on Thursday, Jotham Spreeman, administrator of operators at the Bureau of Child Development and Head Start, aimed to clear up “panic” and “concern.” 
“The three main things to keep track of is to continue to maintain those accurate records like you probably already are, comply with any documentation requests with licensing or from [the department], and then prepare in case we [need] extra information,” Spreeman said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/P1075254-Ayotte-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 18:00:38.792468

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Six victim advocacy groups announced Thursday a new initiative to help the public better protect kids in response to several high-profile cases of child abuse and sex trafficking that dominated headlines in 2025.
Advocates said the new organization, called the North Dakota HOPE Project, was prompted by events like the criminal conviction of former state Sen. Ray Holmberg, who last March was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a child sex crime.
“For many survivors, 2025 felt like a year of nonstop retraumatization,” Stacy Schaffer, executive director of the 31:8 Project, said in a statement announcing the project. “This initiative is about reminding survivors that help exists — and reminding communities that exploitation is preventable.”

The acronym HOPE stands for healing, outreach, prevention and empowerment.
Greg Kasowski, executive director of the Children’s Advocacy Centers of North Dakota, said his organization served more than 3,000 children and families in 2025. About 1,000 children were “suspected of being abused or interviewed by a forensic interviewer,” he said at a Thursday press conference.
“Each one of those cases could have — should have — been prevented,” he said.
Kasowski called on North Dakotans to learn the signs of sex trafficking and how to respond appropriately.
“We have some opportunities today to make 2026 a year where we stop being reactive, and start being proactive,” he said.
To help educate the public, HOPE Project is hosting a six-part free webinar series that focuses on human trafficking awareness and child online safety.
The first webinar takes place Jan. 13 at 1 p.m. To register, visit the North Dakota HOPE Project’s website.
During the press conference, advocates also called attention to the help available to survivors of abuse, including medical services, shelters and other support. A list of resources is also available on the group’s website.
State program expands services to domestic violence victims

Nikki, a sex trafficking survivor who works on the 31:8 Project’s Survivor Advocacy Committee, said that trafficking thrives in secrecy. 
“I want people to understand that human trafficking is not rare,” she said during the press conference. “I am just one survivor among many.”
Nikki asked to be identified only by first name. The Monitor does not identify victims of sex crimes.
Nikki said survivors like her need “safety, support and understanding.”
“By learning the signs, starting conversations and supporting prevention and survivor centered services we can help ensure that no one has to face exploitation alone,” she said.
Nikki said she’s been able to heal thanks to resources offered by organizations like the ones involved in the North Dakota HOPE Project. She’s now pursuing her bachelor’s degree in social work, she said.
Advocates on Thursday applauded a new law adopted by the 2025 Legislature that requires all sixth, 10th and 12th graders in public schools to undergo education about human trafficking awareness and prevention.
“It is meant to complement, not replace, the broader accountability that we are talking about today,” said Mark Heinert, executive director of Youthworks. 
He noted the need for more training geared toward adults.
 “Youth education is strongest when it’s paired with adults who are paying attention,” Heinert said.
The six organizations working together on the North Dakota HOPE Project are the 31:8 Project, Central Dakota Forensic Nurse Examiners, Children’s Advocacy Centers of North Dakota, North Dakota Domestic & Sexual Violence Coalition, Families Flourish ND and Youthworks.
Sen. Dick Dever, a Bismarck Republican who serves on the Legislature’s Protection and Victim Services Committee, attended the event. The committee this interim session is studying topics including state laws related to crimes against children and human trafficking, and current services available to survivors.
Dever said he’d “like to do whatever we can” to further support organizations like the North Dakota HOPE Project. He noted that in recent years the Legislature has taken steps including establishing the Human Trafficking Commission under the Attorney General’s Office in 2015.

The attorney for a Rutland County man facing a murder charge in a fatal crash that killed an officer is asking a judge to reconsider an order holding his client without bail, citing an internal affairs report that strongly criticizes the actions of police leading to the deadly chase.
David Sleigh, a lawyer for 22-year-old Tate Rheaume, in recent court filings based his request largely on an internal affairs report made public in November. The report noted policy violations by Rutland City officers in the pursuit that led to the death of a fellow officer, 19-year-old Jessica Ebbighausen.
The internal affairs report became public through a court filing by Sleigh in the case against Rheaume, who is facing an aggravated murder charge in the death of Ebbighausen during the high-speed Rutland chase in July 2023.

Sleigh wrote in filings that he learned of the internal affairs investigation conducted by a city police commander through depositions of officers in the case and then subpoenaed it from the city police department.
The internal report stated that Ebbighausen’s death was “preventable” if officers had followed the proper procedures. The policy violations, according to the report, ranged from not having the proper authority to initiate the pursuit to not following procedures while the chase was underway.
“(I)t is now beyond dispute that the initiation and conduct of the pursuit leading to the fatal crash was unlawful and conducted in violation of applicable statutes, rules, and policies,” Sleigh wrote in his recent filings. 
“Disturbingly,” the attorney added, “the findings of the internal investigation were purposefully
withheld from the defense in a deliberate attempt to deprive him of a fair trial.”
Sleigh wrote in the filings in Rutland County Superior criminal court that Rutland City police leadership kept silent about the report’s findings for months.
He cited a Brady letter Rutland County State’s Attorney Ian Sullivan, the lead prosecutor in the case, issued against retiring Rutland City Police Chief Brian Kilcullen, as well as retired Rutland City Police Commander Sam Delpha, who conducted and authored the report. 
A Brady letter, which gets its name from a national court case, is filed when an officer’s credibility is called into question.
Sullivan wrote in that letter that Kilcullen and Delpha had improperly failed to disclose the findings of the internal affairs report that criticized police officers for their roles in the vehicle pursuit to “shape” the case against Rheaume. However, Sullivan said in a recent court filing that any possible police department policy violations do not negate Rheaume’s criminal responsibility in the case.
“The IA report is replete with evidence that will illuminate the RCPD’s bias and motivation to obscure the truth relating to the fatal crash,” Sleigh wrote in his recent filings. “All of that will be introduced to challenge the credibility of the State’s critical witnesses.”
Kilcullen announced his retirement last month, and has not responded to requests for comment about what prompted that decision to leave.
The pursuit leading to the murder charge against Rheaume, according to police, ended on Woodstock Avenue in Rutland when he slammed nearly head-on into a cruiser driven by Ebbighausen.
Ebbighausen had been with the Rutland City Police Department as a part-time officer and was set to begin training the following month to get her full-time certification. 
Rheaume, 22, was also injured in the crash. He was charged shortly after the incident with grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with a resulting death and attempting to elude police leading to a fatal crash.
Several months later, Rheaume was arraigned on the upgraded charges, including the aggravated murder count, and has been held without bail since then. 
The charges were upgraded following additional investigation into the crash by both Vermont and New York state police. According to that investigation, Rheaume engaged in dangerous driving at high speeds on the heavily traveled Woodstock Avenue, also known as Route 4, before the crash.
Rheaume, through an earlier attorney who was representing him at that time, challenged the court order holding him without bail. However, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled in August 2024 that Rheaume would remain behind bars while the case against him remained pending. 
Sleigh argued in his filings that the most recent revelations in the internal affairs report “substantially” weakened the state’s case against his client, warranting a striking of the order that Rheaume be held without bail.
In a 16-page response he wrote along with Rutland County Deputy State’s Attorney Daron Raleigh, Sullivan said he opposed Sleigh’s request to the court. According to the prosecutors, the findings of the internal affairs report do not change that it was Rheaume who was driving the truck that struck and killed Ebbighausen.
“Mr. Rheaume was the one who pressed his accelerator until he was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed; Mr. Rheaume was the one who chose to turn into Officer Ebbighausen’s lane of travel; Mr. Rheaume is the one who took no evasive action before hitting Officer Ebbighausen; and Mr. Rheaume is the one who did not brake,” the prosecutors wrote.
“Those actions and inactions by Mr. Rheaume are the natural and continuous sequence of events that killed Officer Ebbighausen,” the prosecutors added. “That sequence of events did not require any actions by another person to come into being.”
Sleigh said Thursday that, should the judge hold a hearing on his request seeking his client’s release, one of the people he would want to testify would be Kilcullen.
Sleigh has called on state and federal authorities to investigate Kilcullen for criminal charges, including obstruction of justice, for his handling of the internal affairs matter and failure to disclose its findings. 
Sullivan declined to comment Thursday.
Rheaume is currently held at the Springfield prison. If convicted of the aggravated murder charge — the most serious state criminal charge — he faces up to life behind bars without the possibility of parole.

Tilted, “A Toast to Our Nation’s 250th Anniversary: Inspired by Founders. Grown by Farmers,” the work was designed and crafted by Jim Victor and Marie Pelton of Conshohocken, who have made 24 butter sculptures for the annual event. 
“It’s an honor to be part of the tradition every year,” said Victor. “Especially for this commemorative year, the 110th Farm show and the 250th anniversary of our nation.”
The butter was donated by Land O’Lakes in Cumberland County. When the Farm Show wraps up, it will be recycled at Reinford Farms in Juniata County, which will convert it into renewable energy in a methane digester. 
Nearly 600,000 Pennsylvanians work in the agricultural industry, which contributes $132.5 billion to the state’s economy annually, according to the state ag department.

Santiago/Getty Images)Despite vows to restrict immigration authorities’ access to Washington state Department of Licensing information, the data sharing continued in a new form, researchers revealed Thursday.
The University of Washington Center for Human Rights reports that federal immigration agents searched Department of Licensing data before stopping drivers at least nine times between August and November.
State officials say they cut off U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to this data in mid-November.
In a joint statement, the licensing department and Washington State Patrol said Gov. Bob Ferguson “stands prepared to take further action” in the face of the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement tactics.
“But he will do so with reason and care,” the agencies said. “Governor Ferguson is committed to complying with applicable laws and finding the right balance in protecting individuals’ data without compromising legitimate law-enforcement investigations of criminal acts that are necessary to preserve public safety.”
The researchers say U.S. Customs and Border Protection still has access to the data, but the state argues that’s necessary for the agency’s work at the Canadian border and airports.
The state’s Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, prevents state data from being shared with federal authorities for civil immigration purposes. Washington is one of 19 states that offer driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status.
Concerns over federal access to this state data date back to at least 2018. But the worries have ramped up in the past year as President Donald Trump has pushed for drastic increases in immigration enforcement and deportations. The Trump administration has focused on accessing various troves of state data to apparently fuel its immigration operations. 
Over the summer, KING 5 revealed continued data sharing through the Department of Licensing’s driver and plate database, known as DAPS. The investigation found hundreds of searches of Washington records after Trump retook office, prompting outcries from immigration advocates.
After this, state officials announced they’d stop ICE from accessing Washington’s driver license data through this avenue.
Malou Chávez, executive director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, said it’s “clear that there are cracks in systems here in Washington state that need fixing to truly protect our communities.”
“Washington, as a welcoming state, cannot and should not aid the federal government in its goal of mass detention, mass deportation by providing access to information, allowing our data to be used for civil immigration enforcement when we have laws specifically prohibiting this from happening,” she told reporters.
How it works
The form of data sharing revealed Thursday forces federal agencies to use a different route than the one that drew scrutiny last year. 
It’s facilitated by a nonprofit that police agencies use to share driver’s license data across states. This allows them to easily search through a platform known as Nlets for information on drivers from out of state that officers pull over. 
A Washington State Patrol platform called ACCESS allows users into the state’s data held by Nlets. The Department of Licensing data shared through this platform includes drivers’ license numbers and photos, home addresses and vehicles’ registered owners, according to the UW researchers.
So, for example, agents could stake out a business, run the license plates of all the cars parked there to get the owners’ names, then look up their immigration statuses and arrest them. 
The UW center’s report includes instances where the licensing department information has been used. 
In one case in November, ICE agents saw a Washington resident in Oregon leaving a Latino grocer. They ran his license plate through the Washington State Patrol system, then searched his name through their own database and found he wasn’t authorized to be in the country, according to the report.
Federal authorities pulled over his vehicle and arrested him, according to researchers.
“These folks are real Washingtonians who have been affected,” said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights. “They are people with lives and families and communities and rights, and they have been harmed by the fact that the DOL allows these agencies to access its data for civil and not criminal immigration enforcement.”
Call for action
In November, Democrats in Congress alerted many states that they were unknowingly sharing information with ICE.
In letters to the states’ governors, they noted Washington, along with Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York, had blocked ICE access to their driver’s license data. They wrote that Washington made the move after “engaging with Congressional Democrats.”
Washington state officials said “thousands of attempted queries from ICE have been denied” since shutting off access to Nlets data on Nov. 19.
But this still leaves the door open for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE subagency, to continue searching Washington’s data, the UW researchers believe. 
Customs and Border Protection conducted the data searches in eight of the nine arrests the center documented. Almost all of the arrests were for civil immigration enforcement, not criminal matters. Though when searching the data, the federal agencies don’t need to note if it’s for a criminal or civil investigation. 
“The state is granting them that access on the good faith assumption that they’re only going to use it for criminal investigations, and the data that we’ve presented here shows that that is not the case,” Godoy said. “They are using it in ways that are contrary to state law.”
The researchers called on the state to block all federal immigration authorities from accessing Washington’s Nlets data. 
“We are reviewing CBP’s use of Nlets, what actions other states have taken, and are looking at all options to protect Washingtonians while also protecting public safety,” reads the statement from the Department of Licensing and state patrol.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
In an executive order in September, Ferguson ordered state agencies to “continue to review their data collection, sharing, and retention policies to ensure they are treating the protection of residents’ personal and private information as a matter of public interest and safety.”
The letters to governors, led by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, said that in the year preceding Oct. 1, federal immigration authorities searched driver’s license databases roughly 900,000 times across the country. 
The center expected to receive records Thursday on other arrests tied to the state data. Godoy said the nine cases documented so far “likely represent the tip of the iceberg.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ice-officer-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 17:12:36.355412
,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 21:57:57+00:00,CT Mirror,CT minimum wage increases to $16.94. Gov. Lamont celebrates impact,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/minimum-wage-increase-ct/,"The state’s most recent increase, announced in the fall, has pushed CT to one of highest statewide minimum wages in the country.","For more than a decade, business owner Rory Gale has run Hartford Prints!, using her downtown Hartford storefront to sell cards, state-themed apparel and home goods. The business, which recently expanded its longtime location on Pratt Street, has become a popular destination in Hartford, serving as a shining example of the city’s efforts to revitalize downtown. 
Gale said the business’s success is the result of factors ranging from strong community support to local grant funding. At a press conference Thursday morning, Gale said state policy has helped her, too — particularly Connecticut’s indexed minimum wage, which rose to $16.94 on Jan. 1. 
“I have hired so many employees over the years, and feel so proud to be in a state that has a minimum wage like Connecticut,” she said.
Since the state legislature passed a schedule of increases in 2019, Connecticut’s minimum wage has increased annually. In recent years, those increases have been tied to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ federal Employment Cost Index, which measures the changes in the cost of labor for businesses. 
The state’s most recent increase, announced in the fall, has pushed Connecticut to one of highest statewide minimum wages in the country, surpassed only by Washington, which has a wage of $17.13 an hour.
Connecticut state officials said that at a time of increased economic strain across the state and the country, a higher minimum wage helps workers get a foothold they desperately need. 
“You hear about affordability, and a lot of that is bringing down costs, and that’s also about paying people a wage that helps them survive,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday. “That’s what we’re trying to do with this wage right now.”
‘This is not just something for teenagers‘
The minimum wage increase was an early priority during Lamont first term. He’s now campaigning for a third term and seeking the support of labor organizations and workers. The governor said his work to raise the minimum wage has helped many, particularly workers of color who are overrepresented in the state’s minimum wage workforce.
According to state officials, more than 60% of minimum wage workers in Connecticut are women or people of color, with women of color representing a large portion of this group.
“This is not just something for teenagers. This is not just an after school job,” said state labor commissioner Danté Bartolomeo. “This is how they support themselves and how they support their families, and when they’re not making a fair wage, they have to work more and have less quality of life, which leads to all kinds of other complications, stress and health and all of those kinds of things”
Still, the minimum wage increase has long been a source of political division, with state Democrats largely arguing that the increase is a necessary economic justice issue intended to address disparities and help narrow income gaps. State Republicans, meanwhile, have argued that the wage increases will stifle economic growth, harming small business owners who are unable to manage constantly increasing wages.
The minimum wage increase has also been criticized by groups like the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, which has argued that the annual rise will negatively affect businesses already dealing with economic uncertainty and rising expenses, potentially encouraging business owners to move to states with friendlier policies.

Lamont however, challenged those arguments. “Going back to 2019, a lot of folks said, ‘If you raise the minimum wage, it’s going to be a parade of horribles,” he said. “‘You’re going to shut down the economy. Unemployment is going to surge. The economy is going to drag to a halt.’” 
Pointing to the state’s recent GDP growth, which rose 4.6% in the second quarter of 2025 and an unemployment rate that continues to be below the national average, Lamont argued that those fears have not come to pass. 
“It’s just the opposite,” he said. “Paying people a decent wage is a show of respect for them.”
There’s still room for new legislation on the issue
Still, even with the state’s improved minimum wage, there is still some unfinished business on the topic. The state’s tipped minimum wage, which covers tipped workers like restaurant and hotel workers as well as a different tipped wage for bartenders, has remained at $6.38 and $8.23 respectively,  for several years.
While there have been efforts to increase those wages to match the indexed minimum wage, including through the growing national One Fair Wage movement, Connecticut has yet to eliminate the tipped minimum wage, with bills in 2023 and 2024 clearing committee but failing to come to the floor of either chamber for a vote.
The current tipped minimum wage has been supported by groups like the Connecticut Restaurant Association, which argues that the current wage structure, which allows for workers to make the tipped minimum wage and add their tips on top, works well for restaurants in the state and allows workers to make far more than the current indexed minimum wage.
Asked about state leaders’ support for changing the tipped minimum wage on Thursday, Bartolomeo noted that the issue is up to state lawmakers to address. “We’ll have to see what the Legislature feels about that this year,” she said.
And while minimum wage increases have helped some of the state’s lowest paid workers, officials acknowledged that the minimum wage is still not enough for one person to truly live on. According to the MIT Living Wage calculator, a “living wage”, defined as a wage that allows a person to meet all of their basic needs, is over $25 an hour for a single adult with no children.
Lamont noted that helping people address those needs, as well as decreasing the state’s rising costs of living remain a priority for his administration. Still, he argued that the new minimum wage is a sign of progress. 
“When we came into office in 2019, this state and this country had been waging what they call a”Fight for $15″—a $15 minimum wage—for many years,” he said. “Connecticut won that fight.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2812-1024x768.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

(Photo by Getty Images)The Wabanaki Nations will now have exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine.
Gov. Janet Mills announced Thursday that she would allow legislation passed by both chambers last session to become law, despite her administration’s initial opposition to the proposal. 
Mills met with the elected chiefs of Mi’kmaq Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Penobscot Nation and Passamaquoddy Tribes at Indian Township and Sipayik this fall, “who each spoke passionately about the importance of this bill in offering life-changing revenue for Tribal communities, as well as providing a form of economic sovereignty for their Nations,” she said in a statement.
She said while she has concerns about the impact of gambling on public health, she believes online gambling should be regulated, “and I am confident that Maine’s Gambling Control Unit will develop responsible rules and standards to hold providers of this new form of gambling accountable while ensuring that Maine’s tribes benefit from its operations.”
The Wabanaki chiefs applauded the law in statements provided by the governor’s office, thanking Mills and underscoring the economic boon it would provide to their Tribes as well as neighboring rural communities.
Wabanaki leaders reflect on gains as Legislature poised to revisit sovereignty proposals

Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis applauded Mills for working with the Tribes on this issue. “This cooperative approach and open-mindedness have led to passage of a historic Tribal economic bill that will benefit not just the Wabanaki people but all of Maine,” Francis said. “It represents a recognition of and support for economic Tribal self-governance and self-determination.” 
Mi’kmaq Chief Sheila McCormack said, “This bill will provide new and sustainable revenue that will deliver needed resources to invest in our community and provide for the health, welfare, and safety of our citizens.”
Clarissa Sabattis, chief of the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, called the new law “an incredible step for all of us.”
“For too long black-market websites have hosted illegal iGaming, with no protection for our youth and vulnerable adults,” Sabattis said. “LD 1164 will create a closely regulated iGaming market with strict controls and will ensure much needed revenues remain in Maine.”
The federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 codified that tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming on their lands, unless the state in which it operates prohibits such gaming under its criminal laws. 
However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act has made it so the Wabanaki Nations are treated more akin to municipalities than independent nations, one way being that the Tribes are unable to benefit from any federal law passed after 1980, unless they are specifically mentioned in the law.
In 2022, the Maine Legislature amended the Settlement Act to permit Tribes to handle sports betting, so the new law would build off of that earlier expansion signed by Mills. 
In a nod to this history, McCormack said, “For almost 20 years, our Nation struggled to gain the ear of Maine’s governors, but under the leadership of Governor Mills, and her commitment to respectful and open communication, our jurisdiction has been reestablished.”
Mills has not supported every effort to expand sovereignty, opposing sweeping reforms in favor of taking a piecemeal approach to changing the Settlement Act. In June, the governor vetoed legislation that sought to prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use. 
Nearly half of the candidates vying to replace Mills have pledged to back full sovereignty if they win the gubernatorial election in November.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/internet-gambling-2048x1363-4-1024x682.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Tim Walz,” Leavitt said. ‘Absolute immunity’The FBI has refused to allow the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation to have access to evidence or other case materials in order to investigate the shooting.  When reporters in the White House briefing room pressed Vance on why the FBI is refusing to cooperate with local law enforcement officials, Vance said it was a federal issue.“The idea that Tim Walz and a bunch of radicals in Minneapolis are going to go after and make this guy's life miserable because he was doing the job that he was asked to do is preposterous,” Vance said. “The unprecedented thing is the idea that a local official can actually prosecute a federal official with absolute immunity.”A federal officer can be prosecuted by local and state authorities if a federal official violates state criminal laws. Absolute immunity is applied to civil liability, and extended to certain positions such as the president, judges and legislatures acting in their official duty. Qualified immunity is usually applied to the conduct of law enforcement and grants them immunity from certain legal actions.Congressional Democrats have decried the shooting and have called for a criminal investigation.",,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Jonathan Steinberg, leader of energy committee, to retire",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/rep-jonathan-steinberg-leader-of-energy-committee-to-retire/,"Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, the Democratic co-chair of the General Assembly’s Energy and Technology Committee, will not seek a ninth term.","Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, the Democratic co-chair of the General Assembly’s Energy and Technology Committee, said Thursday he will not seek a ninth term representing the 136th House District of Westport. 
Steinberg, 69, who said he has held the seat longer than any predecessor, had shared his plans months ago with political allies in Westport, a reliably Democratic shoreline community in Fairfield County.
“I have, up till at this moment, been able to avoid it being broadcast across the globe,” he said.
The moment no longer could be avoided once Matthew Mandell, 65, the executive director of the Westport-Wilton Chamber of Commerce and a member of Westport’s representative town meeting, registered as a candidate for the seat.
“He knew this was my last term, like year ago. So it’s not exactly news. There was, like, a 1% chance that there would become a reason for me to run again,” Steinberg said.
Mandell registered as a candidate Wednesday.
The committee Steinberg leads has become a battleground in recent years over the state’s aggressive regulatory posture towards Eversource and Avangrid and the utilities’ animosity towards Marissa P. Gillett during her tenure as the top regulator.
Gillett resigned in September as chair of the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority amid industry and some legislative complaints over her transparency, veracity and leadership style.
One issue was what role she had in producing an opinion piece harshly critical of the utilities that was published by the Connecticut Mirror under the bylines of Steinberg and his co-chair, Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex.
Gillett later admitted deleting an exchange of text messages with Steinberg, though both maintained that she did not help write the piece. Needleman and Steinberg both were defenders of Gillett.
Steinberg said Thursday the controversity played no role in his decision to retire after his current two-year term ends in January 2027.
“It’s been a long time. It’ll be 16 years when this year’s done. I think I’ve had a good run between,” Steinberg said. “My wife retired in October. She’s happily retired at home. I’ll be 70 in a few weeks. Seems like the right time.”
Steinberg is no stranger to legislative controversies. He previously was the co-chair of the Public Health Committee as it drafted and eventually passed legislation repealing the religious exemption on school-age vaccinations.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025_0108_SR_SessionFirstDay_180-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:59:19.823122

Former wildlife officials warn Trump-appointed team they can’t haphazardly dispose of refuge land, though many support a review of the embattled national system.
The post Wyoming’s Coursey leads National Wildlife Refuge System audit that’s igniting sell-off worries appeared first on WyoFile .","A Wyoming mule deer advocate is leading a Trump administration review of the National Wildlife Refuge System as former agency officials worry the effort is being rushed and may lead to divesting of federal land owned by all Americans. 
Josh Coursey, a Donald Trump-appointed senior advisor to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Brian Nesvik, will undertake a “programmatic comprehensive review” of the 573-unit refuge system, according to Nesvik’s Dec. 16 order. The review also will inventory five marine national monuments, 71 national fish hatcheries and more.
Coursey is the co-founder of Wyoming’s Muley Fanatic Foundation. WyoFile was unable to reach him for an interview before this story published. Nesvik is the former director of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.

The review of hatcheries, marine monuments and 96 million acres of national refuge land — an area larger than Montana — is being rushed and may not account for the purposes for which various refuges were established, seven former career refuge system officials wrote to Nesvik in a Jan. 5 email obtained by WyoFile.
The retirees, who have hundreds of years of combined experience, warned Coursey that the Fish and Wildlife Service “does not have broad authority to dispose of lands” in the refuge system. 
“With certain limited exceptions, [refuge] lands can be disposed of only by act of Congress,” the retirees wrote. 
The seven retirees, who reached the upper echelon of the Fish and Wildlife Service, signed the email to Nesvik, Coursey and Dave Miko, the agency’s acting deputy director for operations. They include four former deputy directors: Marshall Jones, Gary Frazer, James Kurth and Greg Siekaniec. The other three signers are: retired National Wildlife Refuge System Chief Geoffrey Haskett, Division of Migratory Bird Management Chief Brad Bortner and Megan Durham, a former deputy assistant director of external affairs at Fish and Wildlife.

The ad-hoc group also appears worried that Nesvik’s order signals some refuges or hatcheries might be eliminated. Nesvik asked field managers to “look for refuges or hatcheries established for a purpose that no longer aligns with the [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] mission.”
Nesvik’s directive calls for “an initial summary of organizational change recommendations” due by Monday with final recommendations due Feb. 15. That’s a rushed timeline, the former officials contend. 
“Such a large and important analysis should certainly be given more time and resources to develop a thoughtful and useful product,” their email reads.
Nesvik responded immediately, according to Jones, one of the deputy directors who signed the email.
“Brian stays on top of his email,” Jones told WyoFile in a Wednesday telephone interview. “I’m very impressed.”
Nesvik wrote, “I appreciate you and the other co-signers’ efforts to provide your initial thoughts and offer your assistance in our review,” according to Jones, who didn’t share the email but read it to WyoFile.
Nesvik sent the email to Durham, one of the retirees.
“You can expect to hear from someone on the team in the coming weeks as we conduct this important work,” Nesvik wrote.
Room for improvement
The ad-hoc group of retirees supports the overall review.
“We think it’s a good idea,” Jones said. “I’m sure there’s always improvements that can be made.”
The National Wildlife Refuge Association’s president is also cautiously standing behind the Coursey-led assessment. 
“It is a good and necessary thing to understand the complexity of the situation,” President Desiree Sorenson-Groves told WyoFile. 
The audit comes on the heels of long-term declines in staffing and funding that have left the whole system “at risk,” with not a single refuge possessing the resources it requires, according to a recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inventory. Since 2010, national wildlife refuges have hemorrhaged more than 30% of their employees, mainly as a result of losing funding, Sorenson-Groves said.
“Before the second Trump administration, the refuge system was already in a dire place,” she said.

Trump’s “Department of Government Efficiency” exacerbated the situation, further trimming staff at refuges and hatcheries in Wyoming and beyond. Last month, 20 Democratic U.S. senators wrote Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “sound the alarm” on the service’s “staffing crisis.”
“A startling amount of staff and expertise needed to manage the refuge system and protect America’s wildlife have been lost due to the administration’s firings, early retirement programs, and other efforts to push staff out of FWS,” the senators wrote in a Dec. 18 letter. “We ask that you provide Congress with your plan to address FWS’s staffing crisis…”
Meanwhile, Sorenson-Groves is holding out hope that the audit now underway won’t result in recommendations that further whittle away at wildlife refuges, or proposals that would sell them off. 
“If that is the case, then we will deal with that,” she said. “You don’t just divest refuges, as they [the retirees] pointed out in that letter. There’s a process, most of them are public processes, and there would have to be a really good reason.”

Another underpinning to the retirees’ worries is the distinction between the refuge system and the Fish and Wildlife Service itself. That difference appears lost in Nesvik’s order.
“The refuge system has its own organic act that lays out the purposes of the system — the way the system should operate,” Jones said. “It’s not just a subsidiary part of the Fish and Wildlife Service.”
(Fish and Wildlife Service’s mission is “working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people,” according to the agency website.)
The retiree’s email to Nesvik states that federal laws establish specific purposes for individual refuges, “and any review should use these as a guideline, not the overall mission of the FWS.” Federal laws say refuge units should be managed for “the specific purposes for which each refuge was established,” the email says.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act also obligates the U.S. to conserve cross-border avian migrants, the retirees stated. 
‘Things that concern me’
Jones wouldn’t characterize his former colleagues’ views about what’s been called Trump’s anti-environmental agenda, but he has worries.
“It’s not about the political party — it is about the mindset and what people think is important,” Jones said. “There are things that concern me about the current administration. The concerns are very significant now.”
Migratory birds are declining, and even mule deer are another species “in trouble,” Jones said. It’s “a fight” to educate people about the needs of wildlife and make sure those needs are taken into account amid development pressure and pollution that weighs on the natural world, he said.
“The worries don’t magically disappear, depending on what administration is in power in Washington D.C. or state capitols,” he said. “We are passionate advocates of the refuge system [and marine sanctuaries]. These areas are important to the American people for the long-term health of our country’s resources, and they make large financial contributions to the communities involved.”
According to Nesvik’s order, the National Wildlife Refuge System review is to be completed along with “a list of actionable recommendations” no later than Feb. 15. The agency is not soliciting comments from the general public, but it did establish a system so that refuge system staff could anonymously provide feedback. 
The National Wildlife Refuge Association will be weighing in too, using the same approach the retirees did — sending an email.  
“Josh [Coursey] and Dave [Miko], I know that they’re actually interested in hearing feedback,” Sorenson-Groves said. “I’m not jumping to any conclusions because I want to see where they go with this.”

(Screenshot from Zoom)A lawsuit that says the Trump administration violated Colorado’s state sovereignty has been updated to cite additional federal actions the state says are unconstitutional, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser.
The Trump administration has “ramped up a widespread campaign of retribution to punish Colorado” in recent weeks, Weiser, a Democrat running for Colorado governor, said in a press call Thursday.
An October lawsuit says President Donald Trump’s decision to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama is an unconstitutional violation of state sovereignty, since he said he based that decision on how Colorado runs its elections.

Trump’s moves to terminate transportation funding for Colorado, close the National Center for Atmospheric Research, require updated eligibility interviews for people receiving federal food assistance, and deny Federal Emergency Management Agency relief for areas affected by wildfires and flooding also violate state sovereignty, the amended lawsuit says.
“This series of events and the timing, demonstrate and reflect an unmistakable campaign of punishment and threats directed at Colorado to respond to what is the lawful exercise of our sovereign authority,” Weiser said. “And sadly, indications are more might be coming.”
Trump has targeted Colorado because of its use of mail ballots in its elections and because the state has refused to release Tina Peters, the former Republican Mesa County clerk serving a nine-year sentence in state prison for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, according to Weiser. The president threatened “harsh measures” if she isn’t released. 










This series of events and the timing, demonstrate and reflect an unmistakable campaign of punishment and threats directed at Colorado to respond to what is the lawful exercise of our sovereign authority.


– Phil Weiser, Colorado attorney general


“Our Constitution’s clear. States have the power to manage elections and administer our criminal justice systems,” Weiser said. “No administration has sought to take away this power and to try to force states to bend to its will.  This administration cannot be allowed to do so either.”
The amended lawsuit does not include the Trump administration’s recent move to block Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and child care funding, but Weiser said to “stay tuned,” indicating a separate lawsuit could be coming.
Weiser’s lawsuit asks the U.S. District Court of Colorado to declare Trump’s “vindictive” actions specifically targeting Colorado unconstitutional and to bar federal agencies from enforcing the actions. 
“I recognize this is a novel request, and that’s because this is an unprecedented administration. We’ve never seen an administration act in a way that is so flatly violating the Constitution and disrespecting state sovereign authority,” Weiser said. “We have to protect our authority, defend the principles we believe in. That’s why we’re going forward in court.”

,California,2026-01-08 21:40:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Newsom touts his successes, swipes at Trump in final State of the State speech",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2026/01/newsom-successes-swipes-state-speech/,Newsom denounced Trump's cutbacks in federal child care funds and his refusal to send relief funds after the wildfires in Los Angeles County.,"California’s constitution requires the governor to “report to the Legislature each calendar year on the condition of the state and may make recommendations.”
For the past seven years, Gavin Newsom has reluctantly and minimally honored that command, usually eschewing the traditional January address to a joint legislative session in the Capitol.
But today, entering the final year of his governorship, he delivered a 64-minute, no-script paean to legislators that catalogued his achievements and portrayed the state as a model for the world, while interspersing harsh criticism of President Donald Trump as an autocrat who is undermining democracy.
Thus it was not only a celebratory swan song but a platform of sorts for Newsom’s all-but-certain campaign to succeed Trump in 2028 — implying that a prosperous, inclusive and generous California could become a model for the nation should he occupy the White House.
Newsom only mentioned Trump by name twice, once while denouncing cutbacks in federal child care funds and near the end, excoriating his refusal to send billions of dollars in relief for the deadly wildfires that swept through Los Angeles County exactly a year ago.
Newsom termed it “a complete failure to act” and added, “It’s time for the president of the United States to act like the president of the United States.”
During the speech, Newsom also dropped a few hints about what he wants to happen during his final year as governor — particularly about putting the state’s finances in order. Ever since Newsom erroneously proclaimed in 2022 that the state had a $97.5 billion surplus and he and the Legislature ramped up spending, the budget has been plagued with multibillion-dollar deficits that have been papered over with accounting gimmicks, off-the-books loans and transfers from emergency reserves.
The Legislature’s budget advisor, Gabe Petek, has projected another $18 billion deficit for 2026-27, perhaps growing to $35 billion thereafter.
Newsom told legislators that his proposed budget, which will be unveiled Friday, anticipates an additional $42.3 billion in revenues, based on recent increases in tax payments. It will, he said, close the gap and provide money to restore reserves, pay down the state’s pension debt and finance increases in some programs, including a jump in education support.
Were the Legislature to embrace Newsom’s rosy fiscal scenario, it would allow him to end his governorship a year hence with a budget that, at least on paper, would be in the black.
However, recent history implies that Newsom’s projected revenue windfall should be viewed with skepticism. His Department of Finance quietly acknowledged later that his 2022 claim of a $97.5 billion surplus was based on a $165 billion overstatement of revenues over four years.
All in all, it was arguably the most cogent address that Newsom has delivered as governor, even if it ignored, downplayed or rationalized some of California’s most vexing issues, such as the nation’s highest rates of homelessness, unemployment, poverty and living costs, not to mention the budget deficit.
It was clearly aimed, Newsom suggested, at refuting a “California derangement syndrome” that sees the state as a hellhole of crime and squalor, with taxes and regulations that suffocate business and drive people to other states.
It’s a clever play on the “Trump derangement syndrome” that those on the political right often tout. Wordplay notwithstanding, if and when Newsom makes his presidential ambitions official his most daunting factor will be simply that he’s from California.
Reality lies somewhere between the exalted view of California that Newsom peddles, claiming “we simply have no peer,” and the dystopian image that dominates right wing media.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) put forth a plan on Thursday to utilize the full force of the federal government to address the nation’s housing crisis, following up on a previous call to declare a national emergency on housing. 
“There is nothing more fundamental to the American Dream than owning your own home, and it has become increasingly difficult for middle class Americans to do this,” Slotkin said in a statement. “The United States is in a housing crisis, and we need to act now. That’s why my bill declares a national housing emergency, cuts regulations that get in the way and uses the full weight of the U.S. government to increase our housing supply by 4 million homes.”
To meet that goal, Slotkin’s National Housing Emergency Act would instruct domestic industries to boost production of lumber, steel, and manufactured housing to speed up construction and rehabilitation.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The bill sets a minimum residential code standard to ensure the emergency declaration does not support the proliferation of poor-quality housing. It also includes a “pro-growth requirement” for communities seeking federal block grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Transportation. 
Additionally, the act pushes states and localities to cut red tape by compelling them to change laws to allow commercial properties to be turned into housing, eliminate single-family zoning and allow for accessory dwelling units, sometimes referred to as “in-law suites” or “granny flats.”
It also bars states and localities from passing laws, rules or regulations that would impair the build out or rehab of housing during the emergency, which is set to end when either 4 million units of housing are built or rehabilitated, or in October 2031.
The bill does not currently have bipartisan support, making it unlikely to gain ground in the GOP-controlled U.S. Senate.

(File photo provided by Clemson University)COLUMBIA — A Clemson University professor fired over a Facebook post about Charlie Kirk’s death will get paid through the end of the semester, though he can’t return to any classroom at the college, according to a legal settlement.
Joshua Bregy, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Engineering and Earth Sciences, sued the university in October, about a month after getting fired. A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union argued Bregy’s firing violated his First Amendment right to free speech.

PUBLIC Bregy Mediated Settlement 260103 
Along with dropping his lawsuit, Bregy agreed to resign effective May 15, the end of his original contract. Until then, the university will continue to pay him and supply benefits, according to the agreement. During the 2024-2025 school year, Bregy made $91,190, according to Clemson’s salary database.
Bregy, who has worked at Clemson since January 2023, can’t teach, conduct research or interact with students this semester. If he applies for grants, he can list Clemson as his place of employment, and university leadership will give him positive recommendations as he searches for another job, according to the settlement.
“We were honored to represent Dr. Bregy and to reach an agreement that restores his employment, allows him to continue to pursue research funding, and deters the university from violating the First Amendment rights of its faculty in the future,” ACLU attorney Allen Chaney said in a statement. “Politicians and university administrators come and go, but years from now we will still be here. So will the U.S. Constitution.”
In a statement, Clemson spokesman Joe Galbraith confirmed that Bregy will not work in a classroom or with students this semester and noted that both sides of the lawsuit must follow through on their ends of the agreement to make it official.
Another professor and a faculty member were also fired over social media posts criticizing Kirk, a conservative activist, in the days after a gunman fatally shot him in the neck as he debated students during an outdoor event at a Utah university. The other two employees have not sued.
Bregy did not write the Facebook post that lost him his job. The post that Bregy shared but later deleted condemned violence while also pointing to a comment Kirk made about gun violence, calling it “worth it to have the cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year” to maintain constitutional gun rights.
“I’ll never advocate for violence in any form, but it sounds to me like karma is sometimes swift and ironic,” read the Facebook post, included in full in the lawsuit. “As Kirk said, ‘play certain games, win certain prizes.’”
The Clemson College Republicans shared the Facebook post on X, formerly Twitter, alongside other photographs of Bregy holding signs saying Black Lives Matter and climate change was real. From there, the post gained traction, including among state and federal legislators, who called for Bregy’s firing.
The university initially put out a statement saying it disagreed with the sentiments but recognized faculty members’ rights to free speech under the First Amendment, prompting outcry from some who didn’t consider that enough. Republican legislators from both Statehouse chambers, including the lead budget writers, called on the Clemson Board of Trustees to “take immediate and appropriate action,” without clarifying what that meant.
The board suspended Bregy and the other professor on Sept. 15, five days after the Facebook post. Bregy received a letter of termination the next day, saying he “did not show due restraint or respect” and did not clarify that his views did not represent those of Clemson, according to the lawsuit.
Bregy’s firing was part of a nationwide wave of people losing their jobs because of posts criticizing Kirk or celebrating his death.
Some, like Bregy, reached settlements with their former employers, winning back their jobs. Most recently, a tenured professor at Austin Peay State University in Tennessee who was briefly fired because of a post about Kirk received a $500,000 settlement, as well as his job back.

Maura Healey’s office announced Thursday.
Federal enhanced premium tax credits expired at the end of December, creating turmoil for residents whose subsidies had protected them from steep premium hikes. Healey’s relief plan brings ConnectorCare funding to a total of $600 million, which the governor’s office called the “largest state investment in the country.”
The extra state aid is intended to ensure that about 270,000 residents enrolled in ConnectorCare and making below 400 percent of the federal poverty level “will see little to no premium increases because of the expiring federal credits, while also lowering other out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles,” Healey’s office said. That threshold applies to individuals earning up to $62,600 and families of four earning up to $128,600.
“This continued commitment means hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents can continue to afford coverage that’s there for them when they need it, keeping them healthy and financially secure,” Connector Executive Director Audrey Morse Gasteier said. “This commitment reinforces Massachusetts’s standing as the state with the most significant investment in affordable coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.”
While showcasing her plan for the state to step in, Healey on Thursday continued to call on the federal government to “extend these federal credits so that people can afford the health insurance that they need.” 
The $250 million will come from the Commonwealth Care Trust Fund, Healey’s office said. It’s not clear how much money is currently in that fund. 
State law says that money “credited to the fund shall be expended without further appropriation for programs administered by the commonwealth health insurance connector authority.”  The governor’s office described her proposal as a “plan” and said she had “directed the Health Connector to sustain this increased investment.” 
The fund receives money from employer contributions, transfers from the currently overburdened Health Safety Net Trust Fund, and revenue tied to penalties paid by residents who don’t meet the state’s health insurance mandate. Bay Staters must have insurance coverage that meets certain standards or face a penalty.
The infusion offers an “additional subsidy” for people enrolled in ConnectorCare plans designed for residents earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level, Connector spokesperson Jason Lefferts said.
Healey said she directed the Connector to explore other populations that can benefit from heavily subsidized ConnectorCare. The Connector and MassHealth are also exploring other options to prevent coverage losses stemming from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which analysts warn could double the state’s uninsured rate.
To highlight the impact of the $250 million plan, Healey’s office used the example of a 45-year-old couple in Fall River who have two kids and make $75,000. They previously paid $166 monthly for the “lowest cost coverage,” though that figure would have more than doubled to $452 with the expiring subsidies. With the new ConnectorCare boost, the couple will now pay $206 monthly.
Under a federal policy change not linked to the expiring tax credits, residents with legal status who earned below 100 percent of the federal poverty level lost their eligibility for ConnectorCare on January 1. Healey’s plan does not restore this ConnectorCare plan type, Lefferts said.
Due to the expiring tax credits, the Health Connector has said subsidized coverage would not be available in 2026 for households earning between 400 percent and 500 percent of the federal poverty level. 
Open enrollment at the Health Connector wraps up on January 23. As of last week, nearly 23,000 Bay Staters had terminated their coverage through the Connector this cycle, and 23,596 people newly signed up for plans.
The Connector’s open enrollment dashboard notes that individuals who qualify for unsubsidized coverage in 2026 — either because of a loss of federal subsidies or they were already unsubsidized in 2025 — “are more likely to have canceled their 2026 coverage than other types of current enrollees.”
As of Jauary. 4, the Connector counted 368,436 enrollments — with 273,909 people signed up for ConnectorCare, according to the dashboard.

Updated 4:51 p.m.
MONTPELIER—Vermont school districts could see their spending capped beginning in 2028 if the Legislature passes a bill introduced Thursday by Senate Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central.
The bill, S.220, is meant to contain the growing cost of public education in Vermont while lawmakers get back to work on the education reform that began last session.
“We have to take the moment in our hands and try to do something about this ed fund growing by leaps and bounds,” Baruth said in an interview Wednesday. “It’s just a situation where, with everybody acting in good intentions, it’s producing a nightmare for the budget.”

The legislation would limit the growth in each school district’s per pupil education spending in fiscal years 2028 and 2029.
Julia Richter, a principal fiscal analyst with the Legislative Joint Fiscal Office, said during a Senate Finance Committee meeting Thursday that if the bill was implemented in fiscal year 2027 — the budget year starting July 1 — the state would save an estimated $67 million. That projection is based on preliminary local school budget data, as school districts are actively crafting their budgets for the next school year. 
Under the language of the bill, the cap on a school district’s spending would be tied to district’s per student spending in the prior fiscal year.
“So, if you were a high spending district, you’d be able to spend less. If you’re a low spending district, you’d be able to spend more,” Baruth said in an interview Wednesday. “The idea is to try to reach equity.”
In Vermont, where school districts are granted wide latitude to set their budgets, the lowest spending districts sometimes spend half the amount per student that the highest spenders approve. 
Baruth’s bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance after its introduction on the Senate floor Thursday.
The legislation mirrors a similar concept proposed during the 2024 legislative session that would have created “allowable spending percentages,” specific annual growth rates each school district would have had to stay within during subsequent budget cycles.
Under that legislation, lower-spending districts would have been able to increase spending more than their higher-spending counterparts. But the legislation ultimately did not come to pass.
Baruth’s legislation comes as Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he plans on using about $75 million in excess revenue to dampen an expected 12% average property tax increase. That spike is driven in part by a projected $115 million increase in education spending next year.
“While it goes against the grain and doesn’t actually fix the problem we’re trying to solve, I’ll be asking you to provide some property tax relief with another band-aid,” Scott said on Wednesday during his State of the State address.
Even as similar property tax buy-downs have become common in recent years, average education property taxes have risen more than 40% across the state in the last five years, according to the Vermont Tax Department.
Baruth said he generally supports Scott’s use of General Fund dollars to buy down education costs, but said it must be contingent on efforts to cap school districts’ spending.
“I can follow him on that move,” he said, “as long as we have some kind of more immediate cost containment.”
Scott, for his part, “believes addressing spending is an important pillar of education transformation in addition to addressing quality and is encouraged by Senator Baruth introducing legislation to curb spending,” his press secretary, Amanda Wheeler, said in an email.
The legislation already has detractors. Darren Allen, communications director with the Vermont-National Education Association, the statewide teachers’ union, called the bill a “non-starter.”
“We have long opposed Montpelier-based spending caps, and we’re flummoxed, frankly, at the lack of imagination coming out of Montpelier right now,” Allen said.
Allen said lawmakers should scrap the property tax as the means to pay for education and instead institute an income tax “that ensures everybody pays their fair share.”
“We know this is popular, we know this will simplify and make the way we pay for schools more transparent,” he said.
House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, on Thursday said she had concerns about Baruth’s bill. She pointed out that the state already has a version of a spending cap via the excess spending threshold, which financially penalizes districts for spending above certain amounts.
“So the question is, is that not working the way that we intended it to?” she said. “Committees in past years have taken lots and lots of testimony on cap versus excess spending threshold.”
She also questioned what impact the cap would have on school programming.
“If we’re asking people to cut more, what does that mean for our kids?” she said. “And what programs are being slashed? So, there’s a lot of questions.”

(Photo courtesy of UWF)University of West Florida trustees have approved Manny Diaz to serve as its president, the second-to-last step before moving the former education commissioner from interim to permanent leader at the Pensacola institution. 
The board’s approval is subject to confirmation by the state Board of Governors, which is expected to take up a vote later this month. 
“We cannot have an attitude that we’re just a small, sleepy institution and that we’re just good enough. There’s always room for improvement in every organization and I think we’re poised and have the opportunity to do that. And my vision is we’re aggressively going to pursue that, and we’re aggressively going to brand this university, and there’s going to be substance behind it, it’s not just flashy branding. We know we have the substance on the campus,” Diaz told trustees during a board meeting Thursday in Pensacola.

Compared to former President Martha Saunders’ final contract, Diaz is making the same auto stipend of $14,000 and $36,000 more than Saunders’ $24,000 housing stipend. Saunders’ performance bonus, as measured by a percentage of base salary, was 4% higher. Her base salary, however, was $536,273 in her last year.

The former Hialeah state lawmaker is set to take home approximately $950,000 in his first year as president, including a $674,000 base salary, up to 16% performance bonus, or $107,840, $89,000 annually for a supplemental retirement benefit, and another approximately $75,000 for car, housing, and phone stipends.
The contract provides a retention incentive. After completing his third year, he would receive $375,000. After completing his fifth year, he would receive $150,000. Those timelines started when he began his interim role, July 14, so he’s already halfway through his first year for retention bonus calculation purposes.
Makeover
UWF has been subject of a conservative makeover. Last year and at the end of 2024, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the board of governors appointed several new members to the board of trustees. In May, President Martha Saunders resigned before her contract expired. DeSantis’ office, when asked by the Phoenix if the governor played a role in Saunders’ resignation, responded, “Buckle up, you’re going to see a lot of changes [at UWF] for the better.”
The new slate of trustees made headlines last legislative session. Those candidates, many politically connected, faced extensive questions from senators during confirmation hearings. Two of the eight resigned before being confirmed; another, the Senate rejected. He was Adam Kissel of West Virginia and the Heritage Foundation and has since been reappointed — again, subject to Senate confirmation.
One of the trustees, Ashley Ross, worked for Diaz when he was a state senator. She said during the meeting that their work together did not necessitate her recusal.
Last month, UWF trustees approved a statement of institutional neutrality. That declares, in part, “UWF facilitates freedom of academic inquiry and of expression on any subject, which may challenge prevailing social norms, public policies, and institutional practices; however, as an institution devoted to the intellectual pursuit and communication of truth, the university itself takes no official position on public controversies outside its regular activities so as not to undermine the freedom of thought and expression necessary for that Endeavor.”
“I think from Day One, I‘ve declared clearly that we are interested, and this board has declared by passing a statement of neutrality, that we want to spur intellectual debate and conversation in a civil manner, that we want to have perspectives and ideas that are different, but that we have it respectfully,” Diaz said Thursday, adding that he expects “that one voice doesn’t get to be louder than the other.”
Diaz also focused on the importance of the university connecting with military installations in the area, athletics, listening to student input, and investment in academic programs and student life.

Fundraising
With Diaz’s experience in the Legislature, he emphasized how relationships he built in Tallahassee will be useful for fundraising for the university. He served in the Florida House from 2012-2018 and the Florida Senate 2018-2022 before DeSantis appointed him education commissioner, a role he held from 2022 until 2025. 
Diaz said that, following his time in the Legislature, he no longer fears fundraising. “I have no problem asking for money.”
“We haven’t really even scratched the surface with corporate donors,” Diaz said, calling corporations “the next layer” in fundraising. 
Opposition
UWF trustees named Diaz the sole finalist. Had they not, Thursday’s meeting would’ve included a rotating interview of the finalists, with the board making a final vote. Thursday’s meeting outcome was to little surprise.
Faculty Senate President and university Trustee Heather Riddell read into the record a prewritten statement and voted no on the measure that made Diaz the president-elect.
“Faculty have expressed concerns to me about the process in detail in the past several weeks, as a part of the committee I have some as well,” Riddell said, going on the say that she is focused on the process and not on Diaz himself. 
“The hiring of the president should be public and transparent as a public institution, we are accountable to taxpayers and our community,” Riddell said, citing the BOG regulation that requires at least three finalists to be presented to the board of trustees unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”
“There doesn’t appear to be one,” Riddell said.
During public comment, Amy Cook, vice president of the Faculty Senate, made known her concerns about the search, too. 
“Based on standard practices, this appears to be a failed search. I have served on and/or chaired several academic searches. If the committee in any of those searches thought that only one candidate was qualified, the search would’ve been reopened and expanded. If the search truly produced only one worthy candidate to bring on campus, then this should be considered a failed search,” Cook said. “If, however, there were other worthy candidates, then the perception is that this search was predetermined or flawed.”
Cook called on the university to “reconvene the committee to bring additional candidates and to bring this search to a legal, valid, and transparent conclusion.”
“This statement is not about any one candidate’s qualifications, it is about failing to go through the proper process. Not only did this committee deny the final candidate their opportunity to prove his abilities, it also denied other candidates the right to show theirs,” Cook said.
In a news release following the meeting, the university insisted it had followed the laws and regulations governing presidential searches.
More
The contract provides 20 weeks of severance pay and it requires two-thirds of the trustees to agree to terminate the agreement. 
Diaz’s contract term is five years, starting Feb. 1 and running until Feb. 1, 2031.
“Five years flies by and we hit the ground running but we want to continue that momentum and energy. This is not about sitting back, I would say if the Cabinet members thought it was going fast, they better buckle up now, because we’re going to put it into hyper drive, so none of us may be sleeping,” Diaz said. 
Chair of the Board of Governors Alan Levine congratulated Diaz on social media.
“@PresMannyDiazJr earned this. He has done a great job as the interim president, and he had strong local support for this appointment,” Levine posted to X. “I look forward to supporting his appointment when it comes to the Board of Governors, and I hope my colleagues will as well.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Most Rhode Islanders no longer think much about the signature fraud scandal that dominated news coverage during the 2023 1st Congressional District district special election.
Secretary of State Gregg Amore does. 
Amore is still on a mission to scrub the stain left by the criminal forgery of voters’ signatures — including dead residents — on Lt. Gov. Sabina Matos’ congressional nomination papers two years ago.
Matos, once considered the frontrunner in the 11-way Democratic primary, finished a distant fourth despite repeatedly proclaiming her innocence. Two contractors hired to help collect signatures for Matos’ campaign were charged with multiple criminal felonies for the forgeries.
“When the Congressional District 1 signature scandal occurred, we heard many people say we should be asking for IDs when they are collecting signatures,” Amore told the Rhode Island Board of Elections during its Tuesday meeting. “No one is going to give their ID to someone knocking on their door. But we know people are willing to give their IDs through our secure portal.”
The Rhode Island Department of State’s online voter registration system, which debuted in 2016, requires residents to share some form of personal identification — typically a driver’s license or the last four digits of their Social Security number — to register or change their voter information. Since 2023, voters have used the same system, with the same identity requirements, to apply for mail ballots.
So why not extend that technology to the signature collection process required for local, state and federal candidates to appear on the ballot? Amore pitched his first-in-the-nation online nomination paper portal to lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session. The bill passed by a decisive 53-16 margin in the House, but failed to advance out of committee in the Senate amid time constraints and questions.
Amore, a former state senator, hopes getting an early start this year will persuade his former colleagues on the merits of technological advancement. He also sought support from the Rhode Island Board of Elections at its first meeting of the year.
“This is a really good and secure way to make sure the signature is accurate,” he said in an interview with Rhode Island Current. “This way, this person is who they say they are, they live in the right district, and are alive.”










This is a really good and secure way to make sure the signature is accurate. This way, this person is who they say they are, they live in the right district, and are alive.

Other states and cities temporarily allowed online signature submissions for nomination papers during the pandemic lockdowns that complicated the 2020 elections. Arizona and New Mexico developed separate websites or mobile applications for permanent e-signature use, separate from existing voter registration databases.
The electronic portal would supplement — not supplant— physical pen and ink signature collections.

Expanding access 
Amore saw the benefit of increasing access for voting groups often left behind: people with disabilities, who might struggle to answer the door when a candidate comes knocking, along with military and overseas voters.
Candidates are likely to have an easier time meeting the minimum signature requirements to gain ballot placement: 1,000 verified signatures for U.S. senators and gubernatorial candidates, and 500 for U.S. representatives. State senators need to collect at least 100 signatures from district voters, while state representatives need 50. Municipal clerks or voting moderators must collect 10.
It would also ease pressure on local election administrators charged with sorting through and verifying thousands of paper scribbles collected by hundreds of candidates during the two-week nomination period, Amore said.
And it could help the state elections board settle questions over signatures flagged as potentially fraudulent — offering a more objective verification process than matching a hasty John Hancock with a second signature from the same voter in the state’s database.
“I love this,” Marcela Betancur, a state elections board member, said in response to Amore’s presentation Tuesday.










I love this. 


– Marcela Betancur, Rhode Island Board of Elections member


Betancur recalled her dismay at the board’s decision to reject roughly 200 signatures on candidates’ nomination papers in 2022 because the signatories did not live in the same district as the candidate.
“I almost cried sitting here,” Betancur said.
The elections board deferred making a recommendation on Amore’s draft legislation along with other election-related bills presented Tuesday. Also yet to formally signal its approval: the Rhode Island Town and City Clerks’ Association, which is slated to vote at the end of the month, Nick Lima, association chair, said in an interview Wednesday.
But Lima, who also works as elections director for the city of Cranston, expected local election clerks would be supportive.
“It makes common sense,” Lima said.

The race to verify
The two-week period, typically in July, when municipal elections teams are charged with verifying nomination signatures for local, state and federal candidates, is among the busiest and most stressful.
“We come in early, we stay late, we work through lunch,” Lima said of his four-person elections team in Cranston. “There could be over 10,000 signatures we’re looking at, on top of our regular work.”
While speed is essential, so is accuracy. Any signatures tossed, or accepted, by local elections administrators could later be challenged in front of the state elections board.
“We want to be able to stand behind our work, so we need the time to do it right,” Lima said. “It’s a bit of a sprint and a marathon combined in that whole two-week operation.”
Can Amore persuade state lawmakers? Concerns that electronic signatures collections might make it too easy for unserious candidates to get on the ballot were one reason why the Senate Committee on Judiciary failed to advance the legislation last year.
“I would think it would be harder to get 50 wet signatures than 50 electronic ones,” said John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island. Common Cause supports the proposal anyway. 
Amore dismissed concerns over the ease of access to the ballot.
“There still has to be outreach,” he said. “If you just put this on Facebook, it’s not going to do much.”
Face to face 
Amore still envisions candidates going door to door or staking out shopping center parking lots to seek voters’ support. 
Sen. Matt LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat who sponsored the bill on Amore’s behalf in 2025, agreed face-to-face conversations with district voters were still important.
“I like going door-to-door,” LaMountain said in an interview Thursday. “It’s important for them to know who you are. And it’s good exercise.”
But rather than shoving a clipboard into their hands, expecting a signature on the spot, candidates could explain to voters how to go online at home, on their own time, and submit a signature.
Or, perhaps, bring an iPad along with them. Which presents its own potential security risks.
“If someone comes to your house with an iPad, please don’t put your personal identification information in there,” said Randy Jackvony, a state elections board member who also works in information technology. “There would need to be something that prevents that from happening.”
The draft legislation empowers the Secretary of State’s office to create additional rules and regulations governing the electronic signature submission process. One rule could address Jackvony’s concerns around security, Board of Elections Chairperson Jennie Johnson said.
Amore acknowledged the system is not risk-free. But the Department of State’s voter registration portal already undergoes regular and vigorous security reviews beyond what’s required by law, Amore said. 
The cost of the upgrade to the existing infrastructure is still undetermined, though Amore said it could be covered under federal funding for elections administration.
Legislation is expected to be introduced in both chambers of the Rhode Island General Assembly “very very soon,” said Rob Rock, deputy secretary of state. Sponsors have not been determined, though LaMountain said he’d be interested in backing the bill on Amore’s behalf again this year.
“Hopefully we’ll get it over the finish line this year,” LaMountain said. “It’s a good thing to lead the nation in.”
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson remained noncommittal in separate responses, though Shekarchi noted its strong support in the House last year. 
If approved and signed into law, the change would take effect in January 2027, with plans to implement in the 2028 midterm elections.
David Folcarelli, a spokesperson for Matos, said in an email that she supports Amore’s efforts to improve election security and accessibility but declined to comment further.

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)The two groups that sought to enshrine nonpartisan court races are now united behind a single ballot initiative, CI-132, put forward by Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts.
The ballot initiative was one of two nearly identical constitutional initiatives launched to counter a push by Republican leadership, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, throughout the 2025 Legislature to make changes to the state’s judicial system, including allowing judges to run with partisan affiliation.
According to a Thursday press release, Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges, the group started by Ted Dick and Pepper Peterson that sponsored CI-131, announced their endorsement of CI-132.
The consolidation “signals a united effort to protect Montana voters’ 90-year right to nonpartisan judicial elections,” Dick said in a press release. “Montanans for Fair and Impartial Judges believes Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts has a strong policy and the resources to ensure the initiative qualifies for the ballot, which is why we have chosen to formally endorse CI-132.”
Dick has formally requested to withdraw CI-131 with the Montana Secretary of State.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts is a coalition comprising multiple advocacy groups throughout the state including Montana Federation of Public Employees, Big Sky 55+, ACLU of Montana, Forward Montana, and Catalyst Montanan.
The group gained endorsements from retired Montana Supreme Court Justices Mike McGrath and Pat Cotter, and lists more than 1,000 individual supporters on its website.
The text of CI-132 proposes to amend Article VII of the state’s Constitution by adding “Section 12. Nonpartisan Judicial Elections. Judicial elections shall remain nonpartisan.”
“We know that Montanans want to protect their right to judicial elections free from the influence of political parties and politicians,” Caitie Butler, spokesperson for Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts, said in a statement. “We are proud to stand with those who have endorsed CI-131 and CI-132 and begin the work of qualifying this critical initiative for the November ballot.”
The process to get the ballot initiative before voters has already hit some bumps, including a brief legal challenge against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, whose office initially approved the ballot measure as legally sufficient, but rewrote the language of the proposed ballot statement, arguing it did not inform voters what “nonpartisan” meant.
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts appealed to the Montana Supreme Court, which rejected the AG’s language with the majority saying it injected politics into a “straightforward proposition.”
Montanans for Nonpartisan Courts launched signature gathering efforts for CI-132 in December and will spend the next five months talking with voters across the state about the importance of nonpartisan judicial elections.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2026-01-08 16:12:19.378623

Both votes were 248-177.Just before New Year’s, Trump vetoed two bills Congress passed without any recorded opposition in either chamber last year. They were the first vetoes of his second term.One bill would reduce interest payments that Coloradans in the Arkansas River Valley must pay for the construction of a water pipeline to Pueblo communities.The other would require the Interior Department to protect structures within Florida’s Osceola Camp from flooding.Trump said both would be too costly for federal taxpayers.Colorado members call for overrideThe House sponsor of the Colorado bill, Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert, urged her colleagues in a Thursday floor speech to override the veto.“Contrary to what the veto message states, my bill does not authorize any additional federal funding,” Boebert said Thursday. “It simply modifies the repayment terms for small, rural communities in my district, so they are able to afford their 35% cost-share of the project that they are statutorily obligated to repay.”The bill extends Obama-era repayment terms for the local cost-share of a project the federal government approved in 1962.The Dec. 29 White House veto message said the measure “would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.”Members claim political retributionRep. Joe Neguse, a Colorado Democrat, endorsed Boebert’s argument, but added stronger words opposing Trump’s veto.“This bill will cost taxpayers virtually nothing, as was referenced, and it makes good on a promise to the people of rural Colorado,” he said. “We are here because … the president has declared war on our state.”Neguse, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, and House Natural Resources Committee ranking Democrat Jared Huffman of California all said the vetoes were part of political payback by the White House, though they did not offer additional context.“No one voted against this bill,” Wasserman Schultz said. “This bill is entirely non-controversial, and it is so narrowly focused that it makes absolutely no sense, other than the interest in vengeance that seems to have emanated in this result.”Trump avoids another rebukeThe mid-afternoon vote was poised to be Congress’ second rejection of Trump on Thursday, after five Senate Republicans joined Democrats to advance a measure to rein in the administration’s military activity in Venezuela. House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican, said he supported sustaining the veto because he trusted the administration.“I respect the administration’s views on this legislation and its commitment to fiscal responsibility,” Westerman said of the Colorado bill.

Filed Thursday in Franklin Circuit Court, Coleman’s lawsuit asks the court to bar Character Technologies “from future false, misleading, deceptive, and/or unfair acts or practices in relation to their creation, design, promotion, and distribution of Character.AI in the Commonwealth.” 
The suit alleges the company has violated the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act, the Kentucky Consumer Data Protection Act and other laws. It  asks for $2,000 per count, among other requests. Some parts of the lawsuit are redacted. 
The Lantern has asked Character.AI for comment. 
Protecting kids, planning for data centers among AI issues KY legislature urged to tackle

Coleman accuses the company’s technology of encouraging “suicide, self-injury, isolation and psychological manipulation.” The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
The attorney general also says the artificial intelligence “exposes minors to sexual conduct and/or exploitation, violence, drug, substance, and/or alcohol use, and other grave harms.” 
Coleman says “tens of thousands” of Kentuckians “actively log on to Character.AI, including thousands under the age of 18.” 
“The United States must be a leader in the development of AI, but it can’t come at the expense of our kids’ lives,” Coleman said in a statement. “Too many children – including in Kentucky – have fallen prey to this manipulative technology. Our Office is going to hold these companies accountable before we lose one more loved one to this tragedy.”
The complaint asserts that the company’s chatbots have posed as mental health professionals and “are providing minors with mental health advice without any professional degree.” It also accuses the technology of inappropriate “discussion of sexually explicit content, pedophilia, suicide and self-harm, eating disorders, bullying/harassment and illegal drug use and substance and/or alcohol use.”
The Kentucky General Assembly, which gaveled in Tuesday for the 2026 legislative session, has expressed interest in regulating AI. The Kentucky Artificial Intelligence Task Force has met over the last two interim sessions to look at ways to protect minors and address concerns around data centers, among other issues. 
Recommendations to come out of the 2025 task force include: 

Acknowledge that AI technology may be harmful to minors and consider legislative policies for the protection of minors on social media platforms.
Acknowledge that AI may impact careers regulated by professional standards, and consider legislative policies in coordination with professional standards boards to discuss when and how AI should be used within their profession.
Consider legislative policies for data centers’ need for large amounts of water and power requiring more baseload power to ensure grid sufficiency, including consultation with the Public Service Commission.

Donna Boley, R-Pleasants, who is the longest continuously serving senator in state history, resigned from the Legislature on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of West Virginia Legislative Photography)West Virginia State Sen. Donna Boley, R-Pleasants, who is the longest continuously serving senator in state history, resigned from the Legislature on Thursday citing a need to focus more on her family and health, according to a news release from the state Senate.
Boley, who turned 90 years old in December, was first appointed to the state Senate in 1985 by former Gov. Arch Moore. She’s served continuously since then, winning every election she ran in for her seat.
In a resignation letter sent to Senate President Randy Smith on Thursday, Boley said she was stepping away with “a heavy, but grateful, heart.” Her resignation is effective immediately.
“It has been the honor of my life to represent Pleasants County and the Third Senatorial District for more than 40 years. I would not have been able to do that without the support of my constituents who chose to elect me 11 times,” Boley wrote in her resignation letter. “To all of you, the words ‘thank you’ are not enough. I will be forever grateful and proud to have been your voice in Charleston, and I enjoyed my time in service to you.”
Boley held numerous leadership positions during her decades in the Legislature. From 1991 to 1997, she served as the minority leader in the Senate when Democrats controlled the body. For two of those years — 1991 and 1992 — she was the lone Republican in the 34-member body. Those years, she worked as the minority chair for every single Senate committee.
Since 2015, she’s served as president pro tempore for the body. 
In statements Thursday, Smith said it was “hard to find the words to honor” Boley’s years of service, where she brought an “energy that few could ever match.”
“She stood as a strong conservative voice in the Senate, even when she was the only conservative voice. Her institutional knowledge and her ability to work with all people — no matter their politics — is an inspiration to us all,” Smith said. “She’s truly one of a kind. I’m blessed to not only call her my fellow Senator, but my friend. We will miss her every day, but I am so happy to know my friend Donna will be enjoying her retirement surrounded by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren she loves so much.”
During a call with reporters on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said she could not say “enough great things” about Boley, who was first appointed to the Legislature by Capito’s father. Capito called Boley a “great mentor” and a “strong woman” who served her constituents “honorably and bravely.”
“I think [Boley’s service] tells everybody, men and women, that a strong woman can do anything when she sets her mind to it, because that’s what Donna Boley did,” Capito said. “I hope that she is OK. I’m concerned about her and I certainly will follow up with her and her family, but I wish her good wishes, and thank her for the many, many years of service and the many conversations and fun times that we’ve had together.”
Gov. Patrick Morrisey commended Boley’s dedication to her constituents, calling it “unparalleled.”
“Through the decades, she earned the trust of West Virginians and served with integrity,” Morrisey said. “I thank Sen. Boley for her extraordinary service. West Virginia is stronger thanks to her contributions.”
As Boley represents a multi-county district — made up of Wood, Ritchie, Pleasants and Wirt counties — a committee will be formed by one man and one woman from each county, who will be responsible for submitting three names to Morrisey for people to fill the now-vacant seat. The committee has until Jan. 23 to submit those names and Morrisey will then have five days after they are submitted to choose a successor for Senate District 3.
The 2026 regular legislative session will begin on Jan. 14.

(Photo courtesy of U.S. Army National Guard/Sgt. Ian Doyle)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster overstepped his bounds in sending National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., a Navy veteran and nonprofit watchdog agency claimed in a lawsuit filed in state court.
The lawsuit announced Thursday asks the state Supreme Court to reverse McMaster’s deployment last month of 300 troops to Washington and stop him from sending any more National Guard members to the capital or any other state under the initiative launched by President Donald Trump to combat what he called a “crime emergency.”
Soldiers left in early December for a 90-day deployment. It was the second time in six months that McMaster sent National Guard soldiers to the nation’s capital. Following a request from the Pentagon, a first cohort of 200 service members left for the capital in August and returned in September. Maj. Gen. Robin Stilwell is also named in the lawsuit. As adjutant general, he leads the state’s military force and reports to the governor.
A similar lawsuit filed in West Virginia regarding that state’s National Guard deployment was dismissed in November. A circuit court judge ruled Gov. Patrick Morrisey acted lawfully under West Virginia law.
McMaster’s office contends the South Carolina governor also has broad authority to deploy state National Guard troops.
Decades-old South Carolina law says the governor can do so to counteract “war, insurrection, rebellion, invasion, tumult, riot or a mob,” whenever a large violent group is working together to break state or U.S. laws, if there’s imminent threat of that happening, or in response to a public disaster.
The lawsuit, however, contends none of those situations is happening in Washington.
Instead, “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful,” as the president coined the deployment, has National Guard members acting as routine law enforcement officers, according to attorneys for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and nonprofit Democracy Forward Foundation.

Complaint -- Final (1) 
South Carolina soldiers’ “primary mission is to provide critical support to law enforcement agencies, reinforcing safety and security for residents, workers, and visitors in the nation’s capital,” the adjutant general’s office said in a statement ahead of the December deployment. During the August deployment, troops patrolled transit stations, events and popular tourist destinations, the office said last month.
The capital city didn’t need the help, and the mayor didn’t ask for it, attorneys for the ACLU argue.
Total violent crime in Washington throughout 2024 fell 35% from the prior year, marking a 30-year low, the U.S. Department of Justice reported ahead of Trump’s inauguration.
Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, accuses McMaster of using National Guard troops “as pawns in a harmful political gambit brought about by the President’s desire to militarize the nation’s cities.”
Sending South Carolina’s troops to another state means less help if a disaster happens at home, the lawsuit argues. That’s a problem for people like Navy veteran James Weninger, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and a resident of coastal Berkeley County, according to the lawsuit.
“South Carolina’s National Guardsmen should not be asked to undertake illegal deployments or be used to score political points by our government,” Weninger said in a statement.
SC sends 300 National Guard troops to DC in second deployment rotation

Trump asked governors to activate troops under what is known as a Title 32 agreement, which means the federal government pays for the costs of deployment, but the governor keeps control over the guardsmen.
In response to criticism last summer about sending the troops amid hurricane season, McMaster said he’d bring them back if a hurricane or other natural disaster threatened the state.
The guard also said the mission does not diminish its ability to respond to in-state emergencies. The National Guard in South Carolina includes about 9,200 Army National Guard and 1,300 Air National Guard members, according to the guard.
Brandon Charochak, McMaster’s spokesman, said South Carolina governors have “unambiguous authority to utilize and deploy the state’s National Guard to save and protect American lives, defend the homeland, and assist in enforcing the rule of law.
“To suggest otherwise demonstrates either a remarkable ignorance of constitutional and statutory law, or a terminal case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” he said in a statement.
South Carolina’s troops joined around 1,500 more from nine other states, along with local National Guard members, to patrol Washington, D.C., starting last August.
Attorneys in the South Carolina case want to skip the lower courts entirely. The ACLU and Democracy Forward asked the state Supreme Court to take up the case directly, citing its public importance and immediacy. Attorneys also asked for a speedy hearing.

(Photo by Carmen Forman/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A popular pandemic-era subsidy program that has helped offset the cost of child care for families and providers will end in April, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services announced.  
The state agency said the COVID-era program, which provides a $5 per child, per day subsidy to child care providers, will end April 6. 
“This temporary enhancement was funded through time-limited federal pandemic resources that are no longer available,”a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Sharing this update now is meant to give families and providers time to plan ahead.”
The Licensed Child Care Association of Oklahoma, which represents providers, said in a statement that the industry relies on these subsidies and that the cuts “will directly impact families and the availability of child care statewide.”
A spokesperson said in a statement that providers rely on the $5 subsidy to cover “rising wages, utilities, food and insurance.” 
“These changes return child care funding to pre-COVID levels, despite the fact that operating costs are dramatically higher than they were before the pandemic,” the spokesperson said. “Providers are already operating on razor-thin margins, and many say these cuts will force closures, reduce enrollment, or push families out of care entirely.”
The announcement that the program will end entirely comes after DHS last year said that one-time federal relief funding had been exhausted, and that the agency could no longer afford to fund the full program. New applications and renewals for many school-age children ended Nov. 1. 
The Licensed Child Care Association in December sued DHS in Oklahoma County District Court, seeking an emergency injunction that would require the agency to continue to pay the $5 per day subsidy for school-age children. A judge declined to immediately order DHS to fully restore the pandemic-era subsidy program, but litigation in the case continues. 
DHS said this week that the receipt of partial federal funding will allow it to resume paying the subsidies for children ages 6 to 8 until the program ends in April, but the pause on the subsidy remains in place for children 9 and up. Exceptions remain for children in foster care, adoptions, children with disabilities, experiencing homelessness or whose families are receiving emergency financial assistance through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, according to the news release. 
In July, further changes will be made to subsidy eligibility for Oklahoma families. Income eligibility will be 55% of the state median income, down from 85%. This is a return to pre-pandemic guidelines, according to the release. 
“Together, these updates help strengthen the child care subsidy program by expanding support where funding allows and making thoughtful adjustments over time,” a spokesperson for DHS said in a statement. “Our goal is a more stable, predictable program that families and providers can rely on today and in the years ahead.”
Child care providers have expressed concern that losing these subsidies will cause facilities to close, which could harm rural communities where child care deserts are more prominent.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderA Democratic Fulton County commissioner who blocked Republican election board nominees in defiance of a judge’s order is running to become Georgia’s next secretary of state.
Commissioner Dana Barrett announced her candidacy Thursday. Georgia’s secretary of state has a number of duties, including overseeing elections and granting business licenses.
Barrett won her seat representing the Buckhead, Sandy Springs and Midtown areas in 2022 after defeating a longtime Republican incumbent. Prior to her election, she worked as a tech executive, radio host and small business owner.
In August, Barrett and another commissioner defied a judge’s order and refused to approve two Republican nominees to the county election board that the Democratic commissioners called extremists and election deniers. A judge levied a daily $10,000 fine against the board of commissioners, but the fines are on hold while an appeal is being considered.
Speaking at an Atlanta independent bookstore Thursday, Barrett characterized herself as the best candidate to stand up against the Trump administration.
“This past summer, I was threatened with jail time when I said no to the MAGA extremists trying to stack the board with election deniers,” she said. “We’ve stopped them for now, but the fight is not over. I said then that I cannot and I will not hand our elections over to extremists and election deniers who think that their voices are more important than yours.”
The Georgia secretary of state’s office entered the spotlight after the 2020 election when  Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, refused President Donald Trump’s request to “find” enough missing votes to overturn his loss in the state.
Barrett characterized that refusal as “the bare minimum” and criticized Raffensperger’s support for Georgia’s 2021 election overhaul.
She said her experience as a businesswoman has prepared her to serve small business owners and her tech background will help her protect Georgia’s election system from cyber threats and protect Georgians from scams.
Raffenspreger is running for Georgia governor this year, and the lack of an incumbent has attracted a number of candidates from both parties who have also declared plans to replace Raffensperger.
In the Democratic primary in May, Barrett is set to square off against rivals including former TV judge and Biden administration official Penny Brown Reynolds and voting rights advocate Adrian Consonery Jr. The winner will return to face the victor in the Republican primary in November.
On the GOP side, state Rep. Tim Fleming; former state Rep. Vernon Jones, Kelvin King, a businessman and husband to state election board member Janelle King, as well as former state election official Gabriel Sterling, a top Raffensperger aide, have all announced their candidacies.

Ole Miss avenged that loss a week ago in the Sugar Bowl.
Rick Cleveland
Frankly, I thought the Fiesta Bowl betting line would be the other way around with the Rebels a slight favorite over the Hurricanes.
Of course, the oddsmakers set the betting line in an attempt to attract equal money bet on both teams – not because they believe Miami is 3.5 points better than Ole Miss. Georgia, by the way, was a 6.5 point pick over Ole Miss last week. Miami was an underdog in both of its playoff games. Underdogs have won four of six playoff games thus far. Power conference underdogs are a perfect 4-0.
There is a recency bias at work here with the Miami-Ole Miss betting line. Miami is a white-hot football team, having closed the regular season with four consecutive convincing victories, followed by two impressive playoffs victories. The Hurricanes won at Texas A&M in the opening round slugfest and then stunned defending national champ and second-ranked Ohio State 24-14 in the Cotton Bowl. That was the biggest upset in playoff history with Miami a 9.5-point underdog.
Miami dominated Ohio State for most of the game, leading 14-0 at halftime. When Ohio State looked to be mounting a second half comeback, the Hurricanes just mauled the Buckeyes at the line of scrimmage offensively, much the way they had Texas A&M in the opening round. Color me surprised if the Hurricanes don’t try and do the same to Ole Miss. The Miami offensive line is as massive as it is effective. Miami running back Mark Fletcher is a 225-pound bruiser who pushes the pile and breaks tackles. He is a load.

This isn’t exactly breaking news here, but Ole Miss must first stop the run to have a chance to stop Miami. Accomplish that, and then the Rebels have to deal with quarterback Carson Beck’s passing. Beck, a multi-million dollar transfer portal acquisition, is a classic drop-back, pro-style passer who is quite accurate when he has a clean pocket. As with 99% of quarterbacks, Beck becomes much more average when he has defenders in his face.
And that was the case on Nov. 9, 2024, when Pete Golding’s Ole Miss defense sacked him five times in the Rebels’ 28-10 victory over Georgia. Beck was limited to 181 yards passing and zero touchdowns, and he threw one interception.
The Ole Miss defensive staff believes Beck has better weapons around him and a better line in front of him at Miami than he had last season at Georgia. Still, it can’t be over-emphasized that the Rebels’ first task is to stop Fletcher and the powerful Miami running game.
Now then, let’s look at the matchup when Ole Miss is on offense. Miami’s defensive front might be the nation’s best. Defensive ends Rueben Bain Jr. and Akheem Mesidor have been racing one another to get to the quarterback. The Hurricanes totaled seven sacks against A&M and then five against Ohio State. Miami leads the nation with 46 sacks on the season.
Contrast that with this: Trinidad Chambliss has not been sacked a single time in two playoffs games. Part of that is due to good protection, but much of it is due to this: Chasing Chambliss is one thing, catching him is another. On many of his drop backs against Georgia, he made like Houdini, escaping the rush when there did not seem an escape available.
You ask me, Chambliss is the X-factor in this game. He makes plays when no plays seem available. He will have to make some of those kinds of plays Thursday night for Ole Miss to advance to the national championship game.
But guess what: Chambliss has been doing it week, after week, after week. His consistency has been astounding, as his 21 passing touchdowns compared to just three pass interceptions attest. This will be his toughest task to date. The Miami defense ranks in the top 10 in every major statistical category. The Hurricanes can smother you.
Both teams are sound in the kicking game. Both have excellent placekicker, although give Ole Miss the edge in field goal range. Lucas Carneiro makes 50-yard-plus field goals look easy.
Kickoff is at 6:30 p.m. CST on ESPN.
A prediction: Ole Miss 34, Miami 31. Chambliss makes a game-changing play and Carneiro makes a game-winning kick.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/28184542/AP25332676333925.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:57:53.711924

Andy Beshear told reporters the shooting of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis was “foreseeable,” “preventable” and “tragic.” 
The governor also called the Trump administration’s response to the shooting “grossly irresponsible,” when asked about the incident in a Thursday press conference.

Other Kentucky politicians, including U.S. Senate candidates, also reacted to reports of the shooting — either condemning the officer or criticizing the victim for not following orders from law enforcement. 
The Lantern’s sister outlet, the Minnesota Reformer, reported that an ICE officer fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Nicole Good, who was driving an SUV through her car window in south Minneapolis on Wednesday morning. She was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. 
A witness told Minnesota Public Radio that ICE agents gave conflicting instructions to Good, who was driving a maroon SUV, with one agent telling her to move out of the way. Video obtained by the Reformer shows an ICE officer demanding that Good get out of the vehicle. As the vehicle begins to pull away, an officer fires three shots through the windshield and driver-side window. The video shows no apparent harm to the officer, who walked away from the vehicle shortly after the shooting.
Beshear criticized the Trump administration on Thursday for “encouraging ICE to act aggressively across the nation” by celebrating raids via social media and videos. 
“I’ve never seen a government agency push a group of law enforcement to be as aggressive and use the words of aggressiveness that I have with what is being pushed out there on ICE,” Beshear said. 
Beshear said typically in shootings that involve officers “we say we need to make sure we get through this investigation because each one has to be investigated by law enforcement.” He criticized U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for calling Good a “‘domestic terrorist’ without getting the results from law enforcement” and President Donald Trump for his false statements on social media, including that Good had “violently, willfully, and viciously” run over an ICE agent.“This is a U.S. citizen. That’s supposed to be her president,” Beshear said. 
The Reformer reported Thursday that the FBI ousted the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation, according to the official leading the Minnesota agency. 
Beshear also had a message for ICE officers, saying that they “take oaths of office” and are “required to follow the law.” 
“I’d encourage them to do their job the right way,” he said. “They’re not a member of the military. They are a member of a form of law enforcement inside the United States.” 
The governor called Good’s death “tragic.” Good was a 37-year-old mother of three who had recently moved to Minnesota, the Associated Press reported. 
“We’ve got to go about this entirely different than we are right now,” Beshear said. “Yes, we need secure borders, but how we enforce our laws show our humanity or lack of it.” 
U.S. Senate candidates’ responses
Kentucky candidates for U.S. Senate also weighed in. 
On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr said on X that “ICE agents are enforcing America’s laws and delivering exactly what Kentuckians voted for: a secure border and the deportation of dangerous illegal criminals.” 
“Targeting ICE agents will never end well for anyone who tries,” he added. 
Lexington businessman Nate Morris said on X that he “saw an ICE agent acting in self defense after being attacked by a leftwing agitator.” 
“Leftist radicals do not get a free pass to assault officers, obstruct deportations, or ignore lawful orders just because they’re upset that our immigration laws are finally being enforced,” Morris said. 
Former Attorney General Daniel Cameron wrote on X that police officers “take on difficult and dangerous work every day. There was a time when this was universally understood and law enforcement universally respected.” 
“We must return to a standard where following lawful orders is viewed as a civic duty rather than an option. When we do, everyone is safer,” he said. 
On the Democratic side, Charles Booker, who previously worked in the Beshear administration, made a public call to “abolish and prosecute ICE” online. 
“This is ridiculous,” he said. 
Amy McGrath, former Marine fighter pilot, said on X it was “pretty clear” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Noem had “been lying about this horrific killing from the start.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska Board of Regents will not meet Friday to decide whether to proceed with an $800 million deal with Clarkson Regional Health Services for a controlling stake in the future of Nebraska Medicine.
The regents were set to meet at 3 p.m. Friday. They will now meet at 9 a.m. next Thursday. Thirty-one state lawmakers also sent a letter Thursday urging the regents to “tap the brakes” and delay the vote.
“We have an obligation to understand that at a higher level out of just good stewardship for taxpayers,” said State Sen. Brad von Gillern of the Elkhorn area, who led the letter.

The Thursday letter says the public and the Legislature have had “very limited visibility” to understand the full implications of the deal, which was made public less than a week ago. 
Von Gillern said NU is a creation of the state with a large portion of state funding. Yet, many senators don’t yet “clearly understand” the deal.
“Even some of us who have dug into it deeply don’t yet have a clear understanding of the potential impact to taxpayers,” said von Gillern, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee.
Specifics of the deal
The deal would authorize NU President Jeffrey Gold to proceed with a plan to buy out Clarkson’s $500 million share of the NU-Clarkson Nebraska Medicine partnership. Another $300 million would be used to purchase Clarkson properties near the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus in midtown Omaha. Gold has described the deal as an “amicable separation and divorce,” and said it’s now up to deciding custody.

Nebraska Medicine is the hospital and clinical and medical services partner of UNMC. The Nebraska Medicine board opposes the transaction.
Related, Clarkson has pledged to give NU $200 million after the sale for the “Project Health” innovation project, and NU would also commit to operating Clarkson College for five years.
NU had no immediate comment on the lawmakers’ letter.
Joining von Gillern in the letter were State Sens. Bob Andersen, Beau Ballard, Eliot Bostar, Machaela Cavanaugh, John Cavanaugh, Stan Clouse, Wendy DeBoer, Barry DeKay, George Dungan, John Fredrickson, Dunixi Guereca, Bob Hallstrom, Rick Holdcroft, Megan Hunt, Teresa Ibach, Mike Jacobson, Margo Juarez, Kathleen Kauth, Loren Lippincott, Dan Lonowski, Terrell McKinney, Mike Moser, Dan Quick, Jane Raybould, Victor Rountree, Tony Sorrentino, Ashlei Spivey, Tanya Storer, Paul Strommen and Dave Wordekemper.
The vote is expected to occur now without Regent Elizabeth O’Connor, who faces a formal article of impeachment in the Legislature. The Omaha regent announced Dec. 30 she would resign after Friday.

Gov. Jim Pillen would appoint her temporary replacement. His office confirmed it was not yet in possession of a resignation letter by 1:45 p.m. Thursday. Pillen supports the Clarkson transaction and could make an appointment to cinch another vote.
Von Gillern said he’s not taking a long-term positive or negative position on the vote but said more time might be more prudent to flesh out the issue.
The State of Nebraska currently faces a projected $471 million shortfall this budget cycle. Lawmakers control the state’s purse strings.
Negotiation complications
Gold, speaking at a faculty, staff and student forum Tuesday at UNMC, said the deal has been in the works since a few days after he became president in July 2024. However, because of “extremely rigid” nondisclosure agreements, the discussion couldn’t be public until last week.
“There will not be a single dollar of state appropriation, tuition, et cetera, or research funding or indirect cost recovery that goes into doing this,” Gold said Tuesday.
Gold said there is “not contemplation” by regents to financially micromanage the new system, noting certain powers already exist today. Regents also don’t plan to micromanage clinical care.
Regents are barreling ahead partly because if they don’t, Gold said the “exclusivity of negotiations” with the regents would lapse, and Clarkson would likely begin negotiating with out-of-state entities to pursue the deal.

Gold and Pillen, a former regent of 10 years, have said that’s a bad deal for Nebraska. Gold said Clarkson is “hellbent” on moving forward.
“They did not present this as a multiple-choice question,” Gold said. “It wasn’t a discussion about what could we do to stabilize this and retain the dual membership organizational structure, but that it was an inevitability.”
Gold said “we need to put this to rest as quickly as we possibly can and move on,” in part for the health of relationships among NU, Clarkson and Nebraska Medicine.
Von Gillern said he understands the nondisclosure agreements but estimated the negotiations could be a “low risk.” He said he’s not taking a position on the vote, which he said could end up being the “best” or “worst” deal NU makes, “but we don’t know yet.”
The Thursday letter ends: “We would urge you to postpone action on the $800 million proposed transaction to ensure all viable alternatives have been considered and until all stakeholders understand the impact of the proposal for the state and these two great institutions.”

The proposal would reduce the bench from five justices to three. Ultimately, lawmakers did not take any action. 
The post Lawmakers met privately about shrinking Wyoming Supreme Court following abortion ruling appeared first on WyoFile .","Hours after the Wyoming Supreme Court published its long-awaited ruling on two abortion bans — striking them down on account of the state’s constitution — lawmakers held a closed-door meeting Tuesday to discuss next steps. Up for consideration, WyoFile has learned, was a dramatic change to the composition of the state’s highest court.
In Cheyenne, the Joint Appropriations Committee was gathered for the week to continue the budget hearings it began in December. It’s the committee’s responsibility to craft a budget bill ahead of next month’s legislative session. 
Tuesday afternoon, Rep. Abby Angelos, R-Gillette, requested an executive session — a private meeting that the public cannot watch. Another lawmaker offered an explanation. 
“And that executive session is to discuss the possible action … toward the judiciary in the budget,” House Appropriations Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said. 
Rep. Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland, seconded the motion and a majority of the committee voted “aye.”
“Somebody be ready to throw a bean bag at anybody that comes in the door,” Bear said. 
Behind closed doors
The committee then privately discussed but did not take action on a proposal to reduce the Wyoming Supreme Court’s bench from five justices to three, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting told WyoFile. 
Sources also told WyoFile the discussion was in direct response to some members’ disapproval of the high court’s ruling that Wyoming’s two abortion bans are unconstitutional.  
One of the bans was a first in the nation. Sponsored by Senate Appropriations Chairman Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, the 2023 law prohibited the use of pills for abortion. The second ban, sponsored by Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, a Cody Republican who now leads the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, prohibited abortion but included an exception for pregnancies that were the result of incest or sexual assault.

The state’s high court ruled 4-1 that the two laws conflict with the Wyoming Constitution, which protects individuals’ rights to make their own health care decisions. 
Many of the committee’s members, including Angelos, Bear and Haroldson, are allies and members of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republican lawmakers that won control of the House in 2024. Last year, the caucus sharpened its critiques of the judiciary branch, alleging that the state’s process for selecting judges is shaped by “political insiders” and “left-wing institutional capture.”  
Upon Tuesday’s ruling, the caucus quickly took aim at the Wyoming Supreme Court, calling the ruling “a stain on the Wyoming judicial branch” in a statement. 
“After decades of liberal leadership in the governor’s office, the State Supreme Court has been filled with jurists who reject basic biology and human dignity,” the statement said. 
Lawmakers respond
WyoFile reached out to Angelos, Bear, Haroldson and Salazar about the decision to discuss behind closed doors whether to reduce the number of the state’s supreme court justices. It did not receive a response from Bear, Haroldson or Salazar before publication. 
When asked if she expected lawmakers to pursue cutting the high court’s bench and if she planned to support it, Rep. Angelos told WyoFile in an email that she “would never try to guess what 93 lawmakers choose to pursue.”
“They all represent vastly different people across the state and assuming my colleague’s intent would be akin to looking into a crystal ball,” she wrote. 
“However, outside of this issue there have been discussion over the last couple of years among several legislators who do not sit on this committee about judicial reform,” Angelos wrote. “This is a broad discussion that we as representatives are hearing frequently from constituents across the state.” 
As to why the discussion needed to take place in an executive session, Angelos pointed to state law. 
“As stated in Wyoming Open meeting laws, when we as a committee seek legal counsel executive session is permitted,” she wrote in an email. 
Lawmakers could, in theory, change the number of justices on the Wyoming Supreme Court. That decision would require approval in both the House and Senate — a tall order, particularly during a budget session when bills must clear an initial two-thirds vote. But among the lawmakers who discussed the idea are some of the more notable members of the Legislature, and the Freedom Caucus controls the lower chamber.
State law currently specifies that “the supreme court of Wyoming shall consist of five (5) justices,” while the Wyoming Constitution requires that the high court “consist of not less than three nor more than five justices as may be determined by the legislature.”
Out of step or on target?
While some lawmakers have suggested the judiciary is out of step with the public, polling suggests otherwise.
In 2024, the University of Wyoming surveyed residents ahead of that year’s general election. Among other things, it found that 41.5% of the state’s adults either strongly approve or approve of the way that Wyoming judges are handling their job. Another 45.1% neither approve nor disapprove, while 13.4% said they disapprove or strongly disapprove. 
The Wyoming Legislature, meanwhile, received a lower approval rating and a higher disapproval rating. 
More specifically, the survey found that 34.1% of the state’s adults either approve or strongly approve of the Wyoming Legislature’s handling of its job. Another 33.3% neither approve nor disapprove, while 32.7% said they disapprove or strongly disapprove. 
The same survey found a wide range of views on abortion restrictions among Wyomingites. About 31% approved of the kind of ban struck down by the high court, with another 10.5% supporting a total ban. Nearly 39% supported a woman always having the right to an abortion, with the remainder supporting abortion “after the need … has been clearly established.”
A spokesperson for the judiciary branch declined to comment. 
The 2026 budget session begins Feb. 9 in Cheyenne.

,Connecticut Mirror,2026-01-08 20:25:34+00:00,CT Mirror,"Save the Sound, Brookfield move to block pipeline expansion approval",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/08/iriquois-gas-pipeline-permit-block-deep/,Opponents filed a legal appeal to block CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection from issuing a final permit to Iroquois Gas.,"Opponents of a proposed natural gas expansion project in the town of Brookfield filed a legal appeal on Wednesday to block the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection from issuing a final permit to the project’s developers, the Iroquois Gas Transmission System.
The move came in a lawsuit alleging procedural errors by DEEP regarding the type of hearing that was scheduled this week for opponents to raise concerns about the project. 
It was also part of a larger campaign to stop Iroquois from expanding its existing compressor station in Brookfield, which will in turn allow the company to push more gas through its 414-mile pipeline. In July, DEEP issued draft permits indicating its support for the project.
In response to that decision, the town of Brookfield and the environmental group Save the Sound requested that DEEP hold an adjudicatory hearing that would give both parties an opportunity to challenge the permits under Connecticut’s Environmental Protection Act. Chiefly, they presented concerns that the new gas-fired compressors would release large amounts of pollutants and greenhouse gases, worsening local air quality. 
While the agency did agree to hold an public informational hearing, DEEP rejected the request for a more robust adjudicatory hearing, citing issues with the town and Save the Sound’s applications. Without such a hearing, opponents argue, they will be left without means to appeal the agency’s final decision.
The public hearing is scheduled to take place virtually on Thursday evening, starting at 5 p.m. 
“An informational public hearing is still important, and we still encourage everyone with concerns to show up,” said Jessica Roberts, an attorney for Save the Sound. “That being said, it does not provide the same rights that an adjudicatory hearing provides.”
While the lawsuit remains pending, the plaintiffs filed a motion on Wednesday for an injunction that would temporarily halt DEEP’s review of the permits for the new compressors. The New Britain Superior Court judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, had not ruled on the motion as of Thursday morning.
A DEEP spokesman declined to comment directly on the group’s request for an injunction this week.
Following Thursday’s hearing, the agency will continue to accept written comments regarding the permits for the compressor station until Jan. 15, according to the spokesman, Bill Flood. After that, he said the agency will review all comments and make a final decision on whether to issue or revise the permits.
The Iroquois Pipeline runs from upstate New York, across Connecticut and Long Island Sound before terminating in New York City. The proposed expansion, which involves upgrades to several compressor stations, would increase the capacity of the pipeline by 8.3%, or 125 million cubic feet a day. The project does not involve adding new sections of pipeline.
Ruth Parkins, a spokeswoman for Iroquois, said DEEP’s review of the the Brookfield compressor station is the last major permitting hurdle before work can get underway on the $272 million project. The project has already received the necessary permits from New York and federal regulators, she said. 
“We look forward to presenting the project at a public Informational Hearing that the DEEP has scheduled,” Parkins said in a statement. “This hearing, along with a public comment period that closes on January 15th,  concludes the many opportunities that the public has had to provide comment on the project over the years.”
The project has elicited intense local opposition in Brookfield — where the compressor station is located less than half a mile from a local middle school — as well as from environmental advocates who argue that the expansion of natural gas infrastructure conflicts with Connecticut’s long-term pledge to lower greenhouse gas emissions.
Daniel Myers, a member of a local community group opposing the project, accused DEEP of hiding behind “procedural nonsense” to avoid public scrutiny of its permits. If the agency does decide to approve the project, he said it should require Iroquois to use electric compressors and other equipment that release fewer gasses into the air. (Myers’ group is not a party to the lawsuit brought by Brookfield and Save the Sound.)
“Our air quality in Fairfield County is some of the worst in the eastern seaboard, and [DEEP] has an obligation to avoid making it worse,” Myers said. “They’re permitting a thing that only makes it worse.” 
In November, nine activists were arrested after staging a sit-down protest in Gov. Ned Lamont’s office, urging his administration to reject the permits for the project.
Lamont, while not weighing in directly on Iroquois’ proposal, has been generally supportive of expanding pipelines as a way of increasing the supply of natural gas flowing into New England and alleviating winter price spikes. The Iroquois pipeline is connected to another proposed project, the Constitution Pipeline, that would carry natural gas from Pennsylvania to upstate New York.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1117_SR_SunriseProtest_123-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:57:53.711924

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., said Thursday she looks forward to an investigation into the shooting death of a Minnesota woman by an immigration enforcement agent this week.
Capito told West Virginia reporters Thursday morning she had seen video of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shooting Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis. Good was shot through the window of her vehicle. Good, 37, has been described as a “legal observer” to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city. 
“First of all, I think it’s tough being an ICE agent, it’s tough carrying out our immigration laws, particularly in communities where they were in Minnesota where there’s a large immigrant community and broad pushback and fomented sort of protest to them,” Capito said. “Any loss of life is a tragedy. I think we see from the video there’s questions as to how all this happened and why it happened. 
“I look forward to the investigation that I believe President Trump has called for,” Capito said. “And I think that we’ll find the answers here. So I think that it’s tough to watch. It’s tough to watch.”
Capito made the comments in response to a question from West Virginia MetroNews during a press briefing with West Virginia reporters Thursday morning. 
Capito and the rest of West Virginia’s congressional delegation all voted in support of the Big Beautiful Bill Act, which increased funding for anti-immigrant enforcement, detention and deportation to $170 billion over four years. Trump signed the bill into law July 4. 
The shooting and videos of it has sparked division between people like Minneapolis city officials who see Good as a victim and Trump administration officials who claim the officer was acting in self defense. Congressional Democrats have demanded an investigation into the shooting.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Dylan Maher)The Trump administration on Thursday announced Indiana as one of two new national drone test sites — a designation that could attract jobs and spending from the industry.
Sen. Todd Young, who spearheaded the effort to land the site, applauded the move.
“It means that we have the ability and the private companies and universities and military will have ability to fly drones in Indiana’s airspace, which in turn will lead to more research and development, military exercises, more commercial development of drones in the state of Indiana and ultimately more manufacturing of advanced drones in the state,” he told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
“From an economic development standpoint, it burnishes our reputation … as a cutting-edge state for excellence and innovation,” he added.
Oklahoma was chosen as the second new site, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s website.
“From delivering lifesaving medicine to surveying pipelines, drones are already reshaping industries and changing how people and products interact. It’s our job to make sure the United States safely leads the way with this exciting technology – not China,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a news release. “We’ve added these new test sites to help us gather critical data and test new systems so we can safely unleash innovation in our skies.”
Young and the entire Hoosier congressional delegation expressed support for a bid from the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and the Applied Research Institute as the FAA expands its Unmanned Aircraft System Test Site program.
The federal agency currently designates seven drone test sites in Alaska, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Texas and Virginia.

Young said the site will also mean more training opportunities for the Indiana National Guard and other military who come here to train, plus spillover economic benefits to communities that host them — and, high-paying jobs for Hoosiers.
“This sort of work is high-tech, precise and the demand signal is very strong for these best-in-class drones right now,” the senator said. “But not so high-tech that regular Hoosiers who are high school graduates with a certificate from community college couldn’t land them.”
He said it will take about six months to establish the site’s boundaries. It will be a wide swath encompassing Purdue University and southern Indiana.
Universities and military assets were emphasized in Indiana’s application.
The December letter of support pointed to Purdue University, which lawmakers noted has “the first university-owned airport in the country, the largest indoor motion capture facility in the world, and a faculty dedicated to addressing the challenges of safely integrating UAS into the national airspace.”
Indiana’s congressional delegation unites behind FAA drone test site bid

Highlighted, too, was Indiana’s Technology Readiness and Experimentation initiative at Camp Atterbury, which in August “demonstrated the ability to neutralize a 49-drone swarm with a single electromagnetic pulse,” as well as testing space at the Muscatatuck Urban Training Center and counter-UAS work at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane.
Young said he was not concerned that Indiana’s failed redistricting effort would stall federal benefits to the state.
“I just continued to look forward and do my work, having confidence that President (Donald) Trump and the administration would be professional in their selection process and I’m glad they have been,” he said.
Young first pushed the site designation when meeting when then-FAA administrator nominee Bryan Bedford in June.
State-level coordination is additionally part of the argument.
The letter referenced Gov. Mike Braun’s Oct. 29 executive order establishing a statewide drone task force.
The new “Indiana Initiative for Drone Dominance Task Force” will coordinate work across government, universities and private industry to support federal efforts to strengthen U.S. leadership in drone technology and airspace security. The task force must deliver a strategic plan and recommendations to the governor by July 31.
Young, who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee and has worked on drone policy at the federal level, helped Braun craft the executive order.

The two awards are part of $256 million in Education Innovation and Research grant funding announced by the U.S. Department of Education in December. More than 65% of the awards, totaling more than $167 million, will support projects in rural areas, according to a news release from the federal agency.
Arkansas receives $1 million grant to support high-impact tutoring

Ten of the 24 awards went to state education agencies, the largest number of such state-led literacy grants awarded. Arkansas was the only state receiving multiple awards, according to a news release from the state agency. 
“These federal investments affirm the work Arkansas has undertaken to build strong literacy foundations for every student,” Education Secretary Jacob Oliva said in the release. “Through the LEARNS Act and targeted statewide initiatives, we have focused on early literacy, high-quality instruction, and support for students who need it most. These grants allow us to expand and deepen that work, particularly in rural communities.”
The LEARNS Act is a 2023 law that made sweeping changes to the state’s K-12 education system. Efforts to support literacy-related elements of the law include high-impact tutoring grants, increased literacy tutoring support of up to $1,500 for K-3 students who need additional assistance, literacy coaches for struggling schools and a policy prohibiting students who don’t meet the state’s third-grade reading standard from being promoted to fourth grade.
One of the federal grants awarded to Arkansas, worth nearly $15 million, will be used to evaluate high-impact tutoring initiatives at rural schools. The project will be used in partnership with Air Reading, a California-based company that provides virtual tutoring, and include an independent evaluation by Stanford University. 
The second grant, worth nearly $10 million, will be used to study a program that teaches early literacy skills in partnership with the University of Florida Literacy Institute.

,DC,2026-01-08 20:10:47+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Maybe, just maybe, there’s not another shutdown looming at the end of January",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maybe-just-maybe-theres-not-another-shutdown-looming-end-january,,"WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats in Congress are cautiously optimistic they can enact the remaining government funding bills before their deadline at the end of the month, avoiding another shutdown. The milestone would represent an accomplishment for the typically gridlocked Congress, though it comes months after lawmakers’ original October deadline and the longest shutdown in history that reverberated throughout the country.  Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, said recently negotiators are making “progress” toward agreement on the unresolved bills, which include funding for the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security.Those three bills are the most complicated to resolve and this year will be no exception given President Donald Trump’s actions on immigration, deportation and military intervention in Venezuela. Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray, ranking member on the committee, was somewhat less optimistic than her colleague about the likelihood all of the bills become law. But she didn’t rule it out. “It's up to the Republican leadership,” Murray said. “We're working hard to get our end of it done.”House approves some spendingCongress approved three of the dozen annual spending bills in the package that ended the shutdown in November, providing funding for their own offices and operations; military construction projects; the Agriculture Department; and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The package provided stopgap spending for the remaining federal programs in the other nine bills. The House voted Thursday to approve the Energy-Water, Commerce-Justice-Science and Interior-Environment spending bills, sending them to the Senate, where Collins expects that chamber will take a procedural vote Monday. Collins said the remaining six unresolved bills will likely move through Congress in two separate packages — one funding financial services, homeland security, the State Department and foreign operations as well as one funding defense, education, health care, housing and transportation programs. If Congress finishes work on the full slate of bills, which will likely account for about $1.8 trillion in spending, it would mark the end of the first annual appropriations process of Trump’s second term in office.Minnesota ICE shooting jolts processThe biggest hurdle to completing work on all of the bills will be reaching consensus on funding for the Homeland Security Department, especially after an immigration agent shot and killed a woman in Minnesota. Collins said a day after the Jan. 7 incident that members of both political parties in both chambers continue to work on the bill and praised subcommittee Chairwoman Katie Britt of Alabama for “doing a really good job.”Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, ranking member on the subcommittee, however, said there must be “constraints” on how immigration agents are operating. Murphy said the sharp increase in hiring at Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection, spurred by billions in additional funding included in Republicans’ big, beautiful bill, “likely resulted in people being out there on our streets who don't have the necessary training.”“Now I'm not saying that's part of the story yesterday, but we know that they are not applying the same standards and the same training that they have in the past,” Murphy said. “There's a broader question about whether CBP is qualified to operate in the interior at all. From my understanding, CBP was part of that deployment yesterday that resulted in the murder of this young woman.""Murphy said he has a “handful of ideas” about how to address his and other Democrats' concerns about how the Trump administration has approached immigration enforcement, while acknowledging any final agreement will need Republican support to move through Congress. “I won't be asking for the moon. We're not going to fix all of these issues. And I'm not looking for comprehensive immigration reform at all,” Murphy said. “But some targeted improvements in the way that ICE and CBP are operating, I think, are going to be necessary.”Murphy said he believes there is time to work out a bipartisan solution on that spending bill before the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a press conference that the leaders on the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee are having an “important and serious discussion” about the funding bill after the shooting. Congress could pass a stopgap spending bill for programs within the Homeland Security Department, which includes the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to keep everything up and running for the rest of the fiscal year. The fall-back option can be used when consensus on a full-year bill isn’t possible. That type of funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, would keep DHS’ funding mostly flat and avoid the need for it to shut down after the current funding law expires at the end of the month. It would leave in place the types of policies that DHS has been operating under all year. Negotiations continueHouse Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said Wednesday talks on the unsettled bills are “going well” and that she expects lawmakers to meet their Jan. 30 deadline.House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said his “goal” is to approve the leftover bills before the end of the month, avoiding the need for Congress to use another stopgap measure to keep the government up and running or face a shutdown. While the groupings Collins outlined may seem random, Cole said appropriators spent a good bit of time contemplating how to package the remaining bills. “There was a lot of thought given to how to work these things together and what would maximize support on each side,” Cole said. “Obviously, those discussions were had not just amongst Republicans but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other chamber. So we think that's the best package to move forward.” Congress rarely approves the final versions of the government funding bills one-by-one and used to approve all 12 in one omnibus package, though Republican opposition to that has led to smaller “minibuses.”Cole said negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on final versions of the full-year spending bills are being undertaken by subcommittee leaders. “If you can solve these problems at the subcommittee level, you've got the most knowledgeable people, the people that care the most on both sides of the aisle,” Cole said. “The further up the food chain it goes — whether to my colleagues in the four corners (of the Appropriations Committee) or to leadership — the more political decisions come, and the less knowledgeable the people making the decision are about the topic.”Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, the top Democrat on the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee, said that “great progress” had been made so far toward final agreement on that bill.“I'm very hopeful and encouraged, given the work that's been done so far, that we can do that,” Baldwin said. Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy cast doubt on his colleagues’ ability to reach consensus on the last six bills, saying it will be “difficult” to work out final agreements in the time left. “I wouldn't bet my house on it,” Kennedy said. “And if I were betting your house, it would be just a maybe.”Kennedy said he isn’t involved in the negotiations on those bills but expects negotiators are “fighting over something.” Kennedy is chairman of the Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which already completed work on its bill. Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Court System is preparing to finalize new ethics guidelines that will determine whether state judges must opt out from hearing cases due to personal conflicts.
An extensive new ethics code, modeled on a national standard drafted by the American Bar Association, is open for public comment through Jan. 23. 
The changes, which stretch for dozens of dense, jargon-filled pages, prescribe things like what a judge can ethically do during an election, how to respond if someone’s life might be endangered by secrecy and even what happens if an attorney is drunk in the courtroom.
“The primary purpose in my mind … is so a judge can look at it to determine whether what the judge is thinking about doing or is being asked to do is ethical,” said former Alaska Chief Justice Daniel Winfree, a key member of the committee that has been working on the redraft since 2018.
That predates recent concerns over the ethical standards used by the U.S. Supreme Court, whose members have been accused of accepting excessive gifts from people with issues in front of the court.
Alaska’s existing code of ethics dates to 1998 and was based on a model released in 1990 by the American Bar Association.
The association released a new model code in 2007, but Alaska didn’t adopt it. In 2018, as the court system dealt with a rising number of Alaskans representing themselves in court, judges were struggling with what they could and couldn’t do to help, Winfree said.
He suggested adopting part of the new model code to help with the issue.
“And all of a sudden, it got morphed into, ‘Well, we haven’t looked at the entire (code) since the whole thing changed. And so, would you like to chair a committee?’”
Winfree’s been working on the new code since then, continuing even after his retirement from the Alaska Supreme Court in 2023.
“It took a lot longer than I would have expected,” he said.
The code was supposed to become effective in April, but Winfree and others in the court system wanted a longer public comment period. It’s now scheduled for October 2026, time enough to make changes and fix any issues raised through public comments, according to Winfree.
The code applies to members of the Alaska Supreme Court, district court judges and superior court judges, but not magistrates, who are covered by the Alaska Commission on Judicial Conduct.
Federal U.S. District Court Judge Joshua Kindred resigned from Alaska’s federal courts in 2024 after an investigation found significant misconduct. He was later disbarred by the Alaska Supreme Court.
Kindred was a federal judge, not a state one, but the new draft gives a nod to his misconduct.
As Winfree explained, the new code “makes clear that judges are supervisors and that they have other obligations as supervisors than just an obligation to not be a bad person.”
Winfree said that as public comments arrive, the drafting committee will examine each one to consider whether changes need to be made to the existing draft code. 
“Depending on how many comments there are, we’ll probably have a couple of meetings with the Supreme Court to go over each of these things, make final changes, and then go to print,” he said.
“It’s a huge project. We’ll be so happy when it’s done, I bet.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/DSC01376-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes will run for state insurance commissioner, vowing to decline any campaign contributions from the insurance industry.
Sykes, a Lenexa Democrat, announced her intention Thursday to challenge House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a previously uncontested Republican from Wichita with decades of experience in insurance.
She described a platform focused on lowering costs, consumer protection and holding “big insurance companies accountable.”
“It’s simple: The cost of health insurance in Kansas is simply out of control,” Sykes said in the announcement. “Families and consumers can’t afford to keep up with the rise in premiums — on health care, auto, property or any other kind of insurance for that matter.”
She said she will not “take a single dime from the insurance industry.”
Sykes was elected to the Senate in 2016 as a Republican, switching parties during her first term. She was elected minority leader in 2020 and has held the position since. Before her tenure in the Legislature, Sykes ran her own business as a personal chef and a PTA president. She is a mother to two boys and married.
Hawkins announced his candidacy in May, rooting it in conservative values and deregulating the state’s insurance marketplace, which he speculated could lower costs and make insurance easier to navigate.
The insurance commissioner oversees the Kansas Insurance Department, which regulates insurance companies operating in the state. The current commissioner, Vicki Schmidt, is running for the Republican nomination for governor.
Hawkins said in a statement he and Sykes have a good working relationship, and he welcomed a spirited campaign. But, he said, “we arrive at things from a very different perspective politically and quite frankly, fiscally.” He said his focus is on increasing competition, easing marketplace navigation issues and ensuring people are not wrongly denied coverage.
He liked Sykes’ policy focus to “Zohran Mamdani-like woke politics,” referencing the newly elected Democratic mayor of New York City.
Former insurance commissioner and Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius and former insurance commissioner Sandy Praeger, a Republican, threw their support behind Sykes.
“As long as I’ve known Dinah, she’s stood up for what’s right and fought for Kansas families,” Sebelius said in the announcement.
Praeger said Sykes is a practical leader, focused on garnering results over partisanship.
“Kansans want leaders who will listen to them and fight against unfair and discriminatory practices by the industry,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PC022559-1024x576.jpg,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed Wilson to a vacant state Senate seat on Jan. 8, 2026. (Courtesy Chaves County Commission)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Thursday appointed Rex Wilson, a former healthcare administrator and longtime rancher, to assume a vacant state Senate seat ahead of the upcoming legislative session.
Wilson will represent Senate District 33, following the resignation of Alamogordo Republican Nicholas Paul last fall due to health issues. Wilson will serve the remainder of the term until the Nov. 3, 2026 general election.
Because Senate District 33 covers part of Chaves, Lincoln and Otero counties, all three commissions met to consider and submit nominees to the governor. 
Wilson was one of three candidates county commissions put forward for the governor’s consideration.Chaves County’s commission nominated Wilson; Lincoln County commissioners nominated their commission chair, Mark Fischer; and Otero County picked current state Rep. John Block (R-Alamogordo).
Southeastern NM counties submit three names to fill vacant NM Senate seat

Wilson told Source New Mexico on Thursday that he is eager to get to work, namely on healthcare and agricultural issues, though he did not have any plans as of Thursday to introduce legislation or co-sponsor any particular bills. 
“I don’t come with a loaded agenda,” he said. “More than anything is, just get acquainted and build the right relationships in this session and make a difference.”
He also said he is eager to work with Republicans and Democrats in the majority, particularly on health care issues. “I’m a conservative, but also a realist,” he said. 
Wilson was the Southern region healthcare administrator at Presbyterian Medical Service until 2024 and touts 18 years of healthcare experience, according to a cover letter he presented to county commissions. He is also a multigenerational rancher in Lincoln County who was the New Mexico Cattle Growers’ Association Cattleman of the Year in 2017. 
Citing health, NM GOP senator resigns after less than a year in office

He also founded Camp Sierra Blanca at Fort Stanton, a “nationally recognized alternative education model” that gives troubled young people a “second chance through non-traditional pathways,” he said in his cover letter.
Wilson’s arrival at the Senate maintains Republicans’ 16 seats in the chamber. Democrats currently hold 26 seats.
Sen. Bill Sharer, the Senate minority leader, said in a statement that Wilson’s “contributions in the Legislature will benefit every New Mexican and he will make a great addition to our New Mexico Senate Republican Caucus.”
The state Republican Party earlier this week criticized Lujan Grisham for not having filled the seat following Paul’s mid-October resignation. In a news release, the party noted the upcoming Jan. 12 deadline for capital outlay requests and said the delayed appointment created a disadvantage for whomever the governor chose “in their efforts to represent their constituents in southern New Mexico.”
Wilson told Source that he did not think the governor unnecessarily delayed his appointment. 
“I do know they did their homework. I’ll just say that,” he said of the governor’s office. “I don’t think there was any strategy behind it other than just doing their homework.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.13-PM-1024x586.png,,,2026-01-08 15:12:14.901300

The governor just announced Elon Musks’s company, xAI, is investing over $20 billion in the state to build a new data center and power plant in Southaven. This is the largest single investment in the state’s history, Reeves said, and is the fifth data center complex in the state.
“This is an exciting day for Mississippi’s kids and for Mississippi’s workforce and for Mississippi’s economy,” Gov. Tate Reeves said at an announcement live streamed from Southaven on X, formerly known as Twitter, owned by Musk.
The data center in De Soto County is the company’s third in the Memphis metropolitan area. This summer, xAI purchased an old power plant in Southaven where it is running 18 temporary gas turbines and plans to erect permanent turbines. 
Sen. Michael McClendon, a Republican who represents Southaven, said he welcomes the influx of investment to his district, but also has concerns about the impact such a project would have on natural resources in the area. 
“I’d say it’s a good thing,” McClendon said. “My only concern is the aquifers up there, how much water will be used, how much water gets replenished in those aquifers, is there any way that those will be damaged?” 
On Dec. 30, Musk posted on X that xAI had bought a warehouse in Southaven and planned to increase the company’s computing power.
The company will have 2 gigawatts of computing power in the Memphis area. 
“We’re going to do more,” said Anthony Armstrong, chief financial officer of xAI on Thursday during the announcement with Reeves. “It’s in large part because of the responsiveness and cooperation, governor, from your administration.
 Armstrong added that xAI wants its Memphis data center cluster to be the world’s largest supercomputer.
The artificial-intelligence boom has brought tens of billions of new investment to Mississippi. Local and state officials have welcomed these projects, citing benefits such as tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue and new jobs. The state also passed a data center tax incentive in 2024 that exempts companies from sales, use, corporate income and franchise taxes which xAI will be utilizing. 
“I’m not aware of any other state that even comes close to Mississippi in the scope of those subsidies,” said John Mozena, president of the Center for Economic Accountability. 
The Compass data center campus in Meridian was named the worst economic development deal of 2025. The Center who gave out the moniker cited extensive state tax breaks, little local economic impact and lack of transparency as some of the factors contributing to its decision. 
On Tuesday during a board of aldermen meeting, Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite confirmed xAI’s plans to build a data center citing conversations he’d had with the company. Musselwhite called the project “game changing,” adding that the new project would bring around 100 jobs to Southaven and increase the city’s tax revenue. 
Reeves said the center would bring thousands more indirect jobs.
The company has already faced pushback from some residents about the temporary gas turbines it is currently using and potential air pollution. The temporary turbines are less than a mile from a Southaven neighborhood and residents have reported the noise from the turbines has been disruptive. A petition by a local group, the Safe and Sound Coalition calls for the power plant to be shut down and has over 900 signatures.
“It feels like a slap in the face to every resident who’s been fighting for transparency around xAI’s power plant in Southaven,” said Shannon Samsa, a lifelong Southaven resident and cofounder of the Safe and Sound Coalition, “While the community has been kept in the dark for months, xAI is already expanding. Once again, the public wasn’t informed or given any say.”
Elon Musk was not in attendance for the announcement Thursday.

Mississippi poultry company Cal Maine, the nation’s largest producer of eggs, reported sales in the second quarter of FY 2026 were down 19.4% compared to FY 2025. Net sales were $769.5 million, compared to $954.7 million in the second quarter of 2025. The company saw record sales last year due to an egg shortage.
On Wednesday, Open AI and Future Caucus held a workshop with Mississippi legislators about artificial intelligence and ways they could use it in their work. According to the company, 24% of Mississippi Chat GPT users are between the ages of 18 and 24. Open AI demonstrated potential uses of AI including responding to constituents’ letters and creating a custom chatbot. Legislators who attended had a wide range of questions from AI safety and how to spot fakes to the future of state regulation of AI.
The Mississippi Legislature is back in session. Ahead of the session, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann spoke about the ongoing challenges the agriculture industry faces at the Stennis Institute of Government Capitol Press forum. Hosemann proposed eliminating the 1.5% sales tax on agriculture equipment and said that he’s looking into alternative markets for soybeans.

(Photo courtesy of the West Virginia Office of Inspector General)West Virginia has a new foster care ombudsman tasked with reviewing concerns and complaints in the state’s overburdened child welfare system. 
Jessica Bryant, a former Child Protective Services worker, will serve as director of the Foster Care Ombudsman Division. 
“The Foster Care Ombudsman exists to ensure concerns are heard, reviewed fairly, and addressed independently,” Bryant said in a news release Thursday from the state’s Office of Inspector. “I am honored to serve in this role and committed to listening carefully to children, families, and caregivers, while identifying meaningful opportunities for improvement that strengthen the system as a whole.”
There are around 6,000 children in West Virginia’s foster care system. 
Bryant plans to focus on clear communication, objective review of concerns and collaboration with child welfare partners while maintaining the independence and impartiality in the ombudsman’s role.
State lawmakers created the foster care ombudsman role in 2019 in an effort to bolster accountability in the troubled foster care system that has struggled with high CPS case loads, a lack of safe homes for children and communication to those involved in a child’s case.
Along with investigating complaints from foster parents and children, the ombudsman was tasked with advocating for the rights of children and families. 
In 2024, lawmakers passed a bill clarifying that the foster care ombudsman would work impartially under the state’s Office of Inspector General. There had been concerns that the role wasn’t able to work independently without interference from foster care officials.
Bryant previously worked in oversight roles within CPS focused on reviewing complaints, assessing compliance and identifying systemic issues.
She is also a kinship caregiver to a child involved in the foster care system, which “shaped her commitment to transparency, timely responses and respectful engagement with families navigating complex systems,” the news release said.
“Jessica Bryant brings exactly the right blend of experience, judgment, and compassion to this role,” said Inspector General Ann Urling. “Her understanding of child welfare from both frontline and oversight perspectives, combined with her commitment to independence and accountability, will strengthen the Foster  Care Ombudsman Division and enhance trust for the children, families, and caregivers it serves.”
The previous ombudsman, Elizabeth Hardy, resigned in September to become commissioner at the state’s Bureau for Behavioral Health.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has announced several foster care reform efforts since taking office, including an effort to bring 380 foster children in out-of-state institutions back to West Virginia. Foster children are in facilities in states including California, Texas, Utah and Washington, according to DoHS data. 
Morrisey also plans to expand a school-based program for at-risk children to reduce the number of children coming into foster care. He’ll use $8 million in unspent federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families dollars to pay for the project.

(Photo by Molly Rains/New Hampshire Bulletin)New Hampshire legislators are one step closer to loosening regulations on the state’s meat industry.
House Bill 396, which would permit the in-state sale of certain meat products processed at non-U.S. Department of Agriculture facilities, including cuts of beef and pork, passed the House, 214-119, on Wednesday.
Such sales would go against federal law, which calls for meat sold commercially in the United States to be inspected and approved by the USDA, or by a state agency partnered with the department. In New Hampshire, which does not have a state inspection program, meat for commercial sale must be processed at a USDA-approved facility with a federal inspector present during the slaughter.
There are four such USDA facilities in the state, but proponents of the bill said wait times for slaughter appointments are long and difficult to secure for small farmers. This bill, they said, was an important step to help those farms compete in the state’s meat market.
“We need to be cognizant that our consumers and our farmers want this. They don’t have to do it, but they want it, and it gives more security to our state by giving more options,” said Rep. Barbara Comtois, a Barnstead Republican and the bill’s prime sponsor.
Critics raised concerns about food safety, associated with the lack of oversight during processing, and liability that participating farmers could incur by violating federal law.
Rep. Peter Bixby, a Dover Democrat, said he agreed the problem the bill attempted to solve was legitimate. But the bill is problematic because it conflicts with federal law, he said. 
At a hearing in November, Commissioner Shawn Jasper of the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, Markets, and Food said the department would not take steps in violation of federal law. Bixby said this meant the state could not enforce the provisions of the bill, including some of its cold storage, labeling, and humane slaughter requirements. He also questioned whether farmers would take advantage of the program knowing they could incur liability or face legal consequences.
The bill still needs to win Senate approval before it reaches the governor’s desk.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/beef1-1024x694.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 14:58:59.245460

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY  – The head of a statewide Islamic advocacy group Wednesday questioned whether Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s decision to investigate a proposed mosque was a proper use of his office and taxpayer dollars.
Veronica Laizure, Council on American-Islamic Relations Oklahoma executive director, called the attorney general’s plans to use state resources to investigate a proposed mosque in Broken Arrow a “publicity stunt” and “witch hunt” by Drummond, who is running for the Republican nomination for governor.
Drummond on Wednesday issued a press release saying his office would investigate whether the proposed mosque and retail development in Broken Arrow complies with state and federal law and its funding.
“Given the realities of global terrorism, there can be no compromise on public safety and security,” Drummond said. “In our state, we have already seen a radical Islamist sentenced for plotting mass murder. Several 9/11 hijackers had attended an Oklahoma flight school. It is only appropriate to act with caution when the project in question might have connections to the Muslim Brotherhood.”
The Islamic Society of Tulsa is seeking permission from Broken Arrow city leaders to open a 42,000-square-foot community center. It would include a worship area, public medical clinic and retail space.
The mosque is to be built on 15 acres south of the Creek Turnpike along Olive Avenue. 
The  Broken Arrow Planning Commission approved a rezoning request. The Broken Arrow City Council is set to take up the issue next week. The land was purchased in 2014 by the North American Islamic Trust.
Drummond said the North American Islamic Trust “reportedly has ties to the radical Muslim Brotherhood.” The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, is an Islamic political movement. President Donald Trump last year created a process to designate certain chapters as foreign terrorist organizations.
Drummond did not provide proof of the Oklahoma group’s ties to the Muslim Brotherhood in his press release, but also said there are questions about the project’s ownership structure, governance and financing.
Drummond’s decision to invest the proposed mosque “mirrors a broader pattern of anti-Muslim initiatives we are seeing from public officials in multiple states,” Laizure said.
Laizure questioned whether Drummond had launched any similar investigations into other places of worship in Broken Arrow or elsewhere in the state.
“If not, that would seem like a pretty targeted attack on the Muslim community of Tulsa,” Laizure said.
She said there are many other concerns Drummond could address rather than the construction of an above-board and transparent house of worship for a minority  faith community.
The Council on American Islamic Relations is the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization.
Unrelated anti-Islamic remarks Drummond made in June drew pushback from a variety of sectors.
Drummond said Afghan evacuees that have resettled in Oklahoma should be sent back.
Tens of thousands of Afghan refugees were resettled in the United States after military forces pulled out of the country. Many of those relocated had assisted the U.S. military.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, one of four candidates seeking the Democratic nomination to be the next governor, is ringing the election year with a plan she says will ensure health care in the state is affordable, accessible and fair. 
“I’ve been traveling Michigan throughout the last year as a candidate to be the next Governor of Michigan and no exaggeration, every stop, from Iron River in the Upper Peninsula to here in Detroit, to Flint to Muskegon, every stop, Michiganders have shared heart wrenching stories about a broken, unfair, inaccessible and increasingly unaffordable health care system,” Benson told reporters during a Thursday.
Also seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination is Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla. Mayor Marni Sawicki. While a report from the Detroit News said Gilchrist could end his campaign to run for secretary of state instead, the lieutenant governor’s campaign has not commented. 
With Benson and her campaign have touting her work in reshaping Michigan’s Department of State – taking Michigan from 31st in the nation to 2nd in election administration and implementing several voter-initiated reforms including same day voter registration and no-reason absentee voting – Benson pledged to similarly transform the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the state’s largest department. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“As Secretary of State, I transformed our state’s second largest agency to be service driven, saving residents time and money and making their lives easier,” Benson said. “Now I want to make all of state government work that well.” 
At present, the state health department is too complicated, outdated and disconnected from the people it serves, Benson said, later telling reporters that a revamp of the department would be a centerpiece of her health care agenda. 
With many changes from Congressional Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act set to take effect during the next governor’s tenure, Benson said she would ensure the department works with residents to provide easy and seamless access to their medical coverage and other supports.
“That means also building an internal infrastructure that will use all the data that we already have as a state to ensure eligible Michiganders can keep their Medicaid or SNAP access without having to jump through additional hoops, fill out additional duplicative forms, and overall engage in an inefficient process,” Benson said.

Benson said her administration would also fund navigators and community health workers to reach out to individuals to help individuals stay enrolled in their benefits. 
“We’re going to be a helping hand, not an obstacle course,” Benson said. 
In addressing affordability, Benson also promised to establish a prescription drug affordability board within her first 100 days as governor. The board would have the authority to review drug manufacturing practices, approve price increases and hold pharmaceutical companies accountable for price gouging. 
Creating a prescription drug affordability was a key priority for Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer during the previous legislative session, when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. However legislation to establish the board never made it out of the House Representatives after passing through the Michigan Senate. 
Benson said she would use every tool in her toolbox as governor to pursue her health care agenda, and that she would be looking at legislative action as well as executive action in order to accomplish priorities like establishing the prescription drug affordability board.
To address medical debt, Benson said she would empower the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services to implement medical debt forgiveness programs, increase access to financial counseling and partner with hospitals to limit aggressive collection. 
Benson also said she would expand access by investing into more mobile health care units, which will provide low or no-cost medical services to residents of rural and underserved communities. 
Under Benson’s plan, the state would continue to invest in its health care workforce by expanding career technical education programs and scholarships for students pursuing medical careers, alongside creating tax and loan forgiveness programs.
She would also work to address the maternal health crisis within the state, particularly among Black Mothers who are more than twice as likely to die from causes related to pregnancy than non-Hispanic white women. 
According to her health care plan, Benson would direct state investments into culturally competent care, Medicaid-covered doula and midwife services, mandatory bias training for maternal healthcare providers and better access to life-saving prenatal and postpartum care to ensure all Michigan mothers can access the care they need. 
She also promised to take steps to make sure Michiganders have fair access to health care. 
“We need to ensure that medical decisions are based on transparent data and presented in ways that people can actually understand,” Benson said. “That means we’ve got to use technology to help people also appeal unfair health care coverage determinations made by insurance agencies.”
As governor, Benson would require hospitals to show patients their costs upfront and create an online portal where residents can report hospitals that do not comply, working with the Department of Attorney General to hold them accountable.
Her administration would also crack down on insurance companies who deny care to patients prescribed by doctors, by equipping the state health department to help patients file complaints when their insurers reject coverage for treatments. 
Benson also noted Michigan’s aging population as another area in need of action, with nearly 25% of the state’s population enrolled in Medicare, the nation’s insurance program for individuals 65 and older.
To help care for the state’s aging population, Benson pointed to another one of Whitmer’s priorities: the creation of a caregiver tax credit. 
In addition to expanding counseling services for seniors, Benson said she would work to pass a $5,000 tax credit for caregivers to help alleviate the financial burden of caring for an aging loved one.
“The bottom line for me is this: the next governor of Michigan must be prepared on day one to leverage every tool in the toolbox to ensure health care is affordable, accessible and fair in our state,” Benson said. “And I not only have a plan to do that, I have the experience necessary to transform state government to get this done.”

Mike Dunleavy have issued disaster declarations. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)After enduring weeks of record-breaking cold and snowfall that buried Alaska’s capital city, taxing local infrastructure and services, residents of Juneau are now bracing for an abrupt change to rain that will bring new hazards.
The City and Borough of Juneau and the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska issued a joint disaster declaration late Tuesday in advance of an incoming atmospheric river that is expected to create flooding, avalanche risks and possibly landslide risks. Gov. Mike Dunleavy followed that with a verbal disaster declaration that Juneau officials say will provide quicker access to state help to prepare for and respond to impacts of the coming atmospheric river.
Atmospheric rivers are elongated bands of heat and moisture that move north from more southern latitudes. They can dump vast amounts of rain and sometimes snow, and they have triggered deadly landslides in Southeast Alaska and other mountainous areas.
The coming atmospheric river is expected to bring more snow to Juneau at first, but that is expected to change to rain by early Friday, said Nicole Ferrin, a National Weather Service meteorologist.
Ferrin and other officials spoke at a Juneau news conference held late Wednesday by local and tribal officials.
The expected rains will come on top of snow levels that have already strained building roofs, made roadways impassable and caused other disruptions. Officials warned they could trigger lower-elevation floods from clogged waterways and storm drains and various types of slides at higher elevations.
“This storm and the atmospheric river that’s headed our way on top of this historic, unprecedented amount of snowfall that we’ve had does come with an increased chance for landslides and avalanches,” Ryan O’Shaughnessy, emergency programs manager for the City and Borough of Juneau, said at the news conference.
The city may issue evacuation notices if they are needed in certain parts of town, he said.
Dunleavy’s verbal disaster declaration adds to a series of other recent state disaster declarations. On Monday, he issued a declaration for a December power outage in the Yukon-Kuskokwim village of Napaskiak. On Dec. 10, he issued a disaster declaration for a wind storm that caused widespread damage in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. And he and the federal government issued disaster declarations in October for the damages caused to Western Alaska by the remnants of Typhoon Halong.
The new state, local and tribal disaster declarations are currently only for the City and Borough of Juneau. However, almost all of Southeast Alaska is under a flood watch from early Friday to late Saturday, with additional high wind watches also applicable in some areas, according to the National Weather Service.
Ferrin said the deep snowpack in the mountains around Juneau will likely absorb whatever rain is dumped by the atmospheric river.
That is not the case in more southern parts of the Southeast Alaska panhandle, where there is little to no snow on the ground, she said.
Those areas face some different types of flood dangers, including the possibility of landslides, she said.
The atmospheric river heading to Alaska will bring a little bit of snow to the more southern parts of the panhandle, but that will change to rain more quickly than in Juneau, she said. Rainfall in those areas is expected to total 2 to 4 inches or possibly more, she said.
Combined with expected high winds and flooding, there are landslide risks in the southern part of Southeast Alaska that have been noted by the National Weather Service, Ferrin said.
“We will continue to monitor any potentials for other impacts throughout the event and coordinate with the emergency managers in the southern Panhandle for what needs or any impacts that they’re seeing on the ground in real time,” she said.

(Photo courtesy of Layne Griffith)Florida businesses that purposely ignore whether employees are legally in the United States could face hefty fines or even criminal charges if they hire more than 50 undocumented immigrants, according to a sweeping new immigration package.
Filed Wednesday by Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin, the 34-page bill would presume certain non-citizens are at fault in car accidents, severely restrict their employment, and prevent state banks from loaning them money.
It’s the most wide-ranging immigration bundle proposed so far ahead of the 2026 session, and would extend a 2025 crackdown that removed in-state tuition for undocumented students, imposed state-level penalties for illegally entering Florida, and required all counties to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The nationwide push to quash all avenues for undocumented immigration has been exemplified in Florida, the first state to create a state-run migrant detention center. Since President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, Sunshine State officials have mirrored his anti-illegal immigration agenda.
This includes deputizing hundreds of state and local officials to act as immigration officers; Florida is the only state to have all of its (67) counties entering into 287(g) agreements, which are partnerships with ICE.
Martin didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
E-Verify penalties
SB 1380 would create civil penalties for employers who fail to properly use E-Verify, a federal database that checks whether new hires are legally authorized to work in the country. This builds off of another Martin bill, which would require all businesses to use E-Verify.
Employers who fail to check workers’ immigration status through E-Verify before submitting workers’ compensation claims would be personally liable for any costs, expenses, or benefits for undocumented employees.
Purposely not checking their status, however, would result in suspension of business licenses for one year and fines up to $10,000. Doing it again would result in a five-year license suspension alongside a $100,000 fine, and a third violation would mean permanent license revocation and a $250,000 fine.
If the employer purposely flouts this section and the undocumented worker then ends up injuring another person, the employer’s license would be suspended for five years with a $100,000 fine. If the worker kills another person, the licenses would be permanently revoked with a $500,000 fine.
In a similar vein, the bill would impose a third-degree felony charge for an employer who knowingly hires more than 50 undocumented workers. The business would permanently lose its license. The bill would create a cause of action against the employer for any person injured or the next of kin of a person killed by the actions of an undocumented worker.
These provisions evoke a recently closed, two-year federal investigation into Archer Western, a road-building company hired by the state that employed undocumented immigrants for years, as the Tampa Bay Times has reported.
Officials opened the investigation after an undocumented Archer Western employee driving heavy machinery in 2022 hit and killed a Pinellas County deputy. At least 18 of his coworkers on that state-funded construction site were also undocumented.
Car accidents, foreign remittances, and licensing
SB 1380 would create a rebuttable presumption of fault in car accidents involving undocumented immigrants from other states. This means if an out-of-state driver who is undocumented is involved in a car accident in Florida, authorities could presume he or she was at fault — as long as the other motorist wasn’t driving recklessly, under the influence, or clearly at fault.
Insurers could not pay benefits or settle claims with an unauthorized out-of-state driver, the bill says.
Additionally, the bill requires law enforcement officers investigating car accidents to verify whether the parties are legally in the country.
Other provisions would ban the state Division of Risk Management from approving a claim submitted by an adult undocumented immigrant. Unauthorized immigrants would be barred from sending money to other countries and state banks could not accept IDs traditionally used by undocumented immigrants or those illegally in the state with down payments or loans.
All licensing procedures, relicensing instruction, and licensing testing must be conducted in English, the bill says. Interpreters, translators, or alternate language accommodations would be banned.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Kevin Nance)A new Kentucky law that stands to put many peer support specialists out of work should be declared “void and unenforceable,” says a lawsuit filed in Fayette Circuit Court that seeks an expedited hearing.
The law, which took effect Jan. 1, sets new licensing standards for peer support specialists to be employed in many drug and alcohol treatment settings. It triggered the apparently unintended cut-off of Medicaid payments to support the work of the vast majority of Kentucky’s peer support workforce who have yet to obtain the new credential.
Peer support is considered an essential ingredient in recovery. Peer support specialists, who earn $15-$18 an hour in Kentucky, share their first-hand experiences of addiction and hope with those new to recovery. Their duties range from providing transportation to medical appointments and court dates to teaching problem-solving skills.
Mary Helen Shashy is executive director of Grin Grant Inc.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of peer support specialists Wes Hagenbuch and Adrianna Kenley and Grin Grant Inc., a Lexington-based nonprofit that employs and trains peer support workers.
The defendants are the Kentucky Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors; the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and its secretary, Dr. Steven Stack, and the state Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities.
The suit, filed Dec. 27 by attorney Frank Miller, alleges that no regulations for implementing the new law have been enacted by the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors, creating uncertainty and making it impossible to comply with the law’s new requirements.
Hagenbuch says in an affidavit that state government agencies have put out “inconsistent and shifting compliance expectations, enforcement standards, and timelines applicable to my work.”
As of Jan. 8, only 74 people had been licensed under the new law as registered alcohol and drug peer support specialists, compared with 16,883 who were certified under the previous standards.
The legislation, House Bill 505 enacted in 2024, includes a provision to allow Medicaid reimbursements to continue for peer support workers who obtain a temporary credential under the new standards, but the Beshear administration has said that Kentucky Medicaid rules, approved by the federal government, do not allow Medicaid reimbursement for services provided by someone with only a temporary credential.
The Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors has approved 755 temporary credentials for alcohol and drug peer support specialists.
Kentucky set to pull funding from peer support for recovery, is asked to reconsider

The lawsuit asks Fayette Circuit Judge Thomas L. Travis for expedited consideration and to issue a restraining order and injunction. 
In response to the lawsuit, Kendra Steele, spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said via email, “Team Kentucky is committed to ensuring those suffering from addiction have access to the support services they need.  
“CHFS would support any changes the General Assembly would take to update HB 505 to allow more peer support specialists to provide services and expand what Medicaid can cover for those services.   
“However, as it is currently written, the law passed by the General Assembly required these changes to go into effect January 1st, impacting what Kentucky Medicaid can legally reimburse for peer support specialist services — which this lawsuit seems to ignore.”
The Lantern is awaiting a response from the Public Protection Cabinet, which oversees the Board of Alcohol and Drug Counselors.
Last month before the law took effect, peer support specialist Chris Sudduth of Georgetown told the Lantern his work hours had already been cut because employers “don’t know how to navigate the new laws.”
Sudduth, 43, a peer support specialist for three years, said, “I’m afraid I’m going to lose my apartment, everything I’ve worked for these three years. Even more I’m afraid I’m going to lose my sobriety over it.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Peer-support_DxO-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

(Getty Images)State health officials won’t change their recommendations for childhood vaccines, endorsing the guidance of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services announced Thursday.
The announcement comes three days after the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday scaled back its list of recommended childhood vaccines — cutting its list of diseases for which childhood vaccines were recommended to 11 from 17.
The change has alarmed public health organizations and providers across the country.
“No new clinical data on either safety or effectiveness were presented that would justify these changes,” wrote Dr. Ryan Westergaard, the DHS chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for communicable disease, in a memo sent Thursday to providers and organizations that offer vaccination services in Wisconsin.
Ryan Westergaard, M.D., Wisconsin Dept. of Health Services
“The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) stands by our current clinical guidance regarding vaccines in Wisconsin, and will not be making any changes to Wisconsin’s school or child care recommendations,” Westergaard wrote.
“We have not seen any new scientific evidence that would justify changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, which is widely understood to have prevented millions of infections and continues to protect the health of children in the United States,” Westergaard said Thursday.
The department is following the childhood vaccine recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“Wisconsin providers should continue to follow evidence-based vaccine recommendations from AAP and other professional medical organizations, and parents should talk to trusted health care providers about timely vaccination,” said Dr. Stephanie Schauer, the DHS immunization program manager. “This is our best way to prevent the spread of diseases that can cause life-long health impacts for children, families, and entire communities.”
The CDC’s decision followed a directive in December from President Donald Trump to look to other developed countries, including Denmark, in revising its vaccine schedule. Federal officials said the change was based on that review and called the U.S. a “global outlier” for the number of diseases and vaccine doses in its recommendations.  
“The CDC’s new recommendations were based on a brief review of other countries’ practices and not based on data or evidence regarding disease risks to children in the United States,” DHS Secretary-designee Kirsten Johnson said Thursday. “This upends our longstanding, evidence-based approach of protecting our children from the viruses that pose a risk in our country.”
She said the CDC change ignored other factors.
“Copying another country’s schedule without its health and social infrastructure will not produce the same health outcomes,” Johnson said. “It creates chaos and confusion and risks the health of Wisconsin’s youngest and most vulnerable citizens.”
DHS administers Wisconsin’s Medicaid programs and said the health insurance program for people with low incomes will cover all the recommended vaccines, including for newborns. They will also remain covered under the Vaccines for Children program.
The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance issued a reminder Thursday that state law requires individual, small group and self-funded health plans to cover immunizations for patients and their dependents from birth without a copayment.

To check on a child’s vaccine status and recommended vaccines see the  Wisconsin Immunization Registry.

Newsom will tout a 9% reduction in unsheltered homelessness, cheaper insulin and increased clean energy use in California as among his accomplishments, in a speech delivered with an eye toward higher office. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom will promote California as an antidote to the Trump agenda on Thursday, telling lawmakers during a wide-ranging State of the State address that California still leads in a host of critical areas such as manufacturing, technology and agriculture. 
“Every year, the declinists, the pundits and critics suffering from California derangement syndrome look at this state and try to tear down our progress,” he said in prepared remarks released ahead of delivery. “California’s success is not by chance — it’s by design.”
He will tout a 9% reduction in unsheltered homelessness, cheaper insulin and increased clean energy use in California as among his accomplishments, in a speech delivered with an eye toward higher office. 
The address is his first State of the State before the Legislature since 2020. He will use it as an opportunity to highlight progress on some of his most ambitious promises, some of which haven’t been met, while positioning California and its leader as worthy of national leadership. 
He targeted the Trump administration on a range of issues, including excessive policing and immigration raids, saying the state “faces an assault on our values unlike anything I have seen in my lifetime.” And in a common talking point for Newsom recently, he criticized the president for deprioritizing clean energy as China surges forward in electric vehicle production.
“In California, we are not silent. We are not hunkering down. We are not retreating. We are a beacon. This state is providing a different narrative,” he said in the prepared remarks. 
On homelessness, the announced reduction in 2025 of unsheltered people, or the number of people who sleep outside, in cars or anywhere else not meant for habitation, is an important figure for the governor as he seeks to show improvement on one of California’s most stubborn challenges in his final year in office. 
A humanitarian and public health crisis and the most visible consequence of California’s housing shortage, homelessness is sure to be an issue on which Newsom faces national criticism should he make an expected presidential run in 2028. 
But the reduction came after years of increases in homelessness despite Newsom’s campaign promises to address the issue and his administration pouring over $24 billion into it during his two terms. In 2024, the year before the announced reduction, homelessness in California hit a record high: 123,974 were unsheltered while 63,110 were sheltered. That year, homelessness also spiked nationally.
Newsom on Thursday will not announce the number who were homeless overall in 2025. He will tout his administration’s focus on sweeping street encampments and building new mental health facilities paid for with Prop. 1, a bond he promoted and which voters approved in 2024.
He will also speak about making the state more affordable, an issue over which Democrats and Republicans nationally are jockeying for credit after the 2024 presidential election showed voters were heavily motivated by the high cost of living. 
He plans to seek out policies in his final year in office to crack down on large-scale investors buying up houses, forcing would-be homebuyers to compete — a day after Trump also announced a similar effort. It’s a new area for him in housing policy, after years seeking to boost construction. Newsom ran on a promise of building 3.5 million new housing units; the state has fallen far short of that. 
Newsom also ran on a promise of a universal public health care system; he has since shifted to expanding access to Medi-Cal, the state health program for low-income residents that faces punishing federal cuts under Trump. On Thursday, he will tout the state’s production of $11 insulin as one way his administration has tackled health care costs. 
Projecting a rosier budget outlook
The address was also a preview of Newsom’s last budget proposal, to be released Friday. 
Though the state began the year facing an estimated $18 billion deficit and remains threatened by federal cuts, Newsom said revenues have come in $42 billion higher than expected — a “windfall” officials mostly attribute to stock market gains and the artificial intelligence boom. 
That could allow him to avoid difficult fights with Democratic lawmakers over major cuts to programs in his final year in office, while maintaining funding for banner Newsom administration priorities like expanding public school to include all four-year-olds and providing more funding for community colleges. 
With a rosier-than-expected financial picture, Democrats will be sure to jockey for additional funding for their favored programs or to reverse scheduled cuts to Medi-Cal coverage for low-income undocumented immigrant adults they made last year. But Newsom will propose instead to put $7 billion into reserves and $11 billion toward pension obligations. 
And as Democrats debate a proposal to tax the wealthiest Californians to generate more revenue (an idea Newsom opposes), the governor instead will propose to renew a business development tax credit that has been often used by the technology and manufacturing sectors.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/011024_Newsom-Jan-Budget_MG_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

Joe Sweeney speaks at a press conference to outline House Republican priorities for 2026 on Oct. 30, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire House abruptly killed a Republican bill to impose budget caps on school districts Thursday, after some Republicans joined Democrats to dramatically alter the bill. 
The chamber also voted against reconsidering the bill, a parliamentary move that prevents the proposal from returning to the House floor this year, in a major setback for the Republican priority. 
After a chaotic series of votes, the chamber voted, 346-9, to strike down the bill, House Bill 675. But that vote came after Democrats teamed up with 22 Republicans to pass a floor amendment to override most of the original bill and limit the cap only to school district administrative expenses. 
That change, which passed, 182-173, proved to be a dealbreaker for the Republican supporters of the original bill. After the alteration, the bail failed an ought-to-pass nearly unanimously, and then was killed by voice vote. 
Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican, accused Democrats of deploying a “poison pill,” in which lawmakers alter a bill solely to make it unpalatable to pass.
“So weird how all the Democrats who voted to replace the bill entirely with the poison pill amendment then voted against the bill — comprised entirely of their poison pill amendment they supported minutes before,” Sweeney wrote on the social media platform X.
The idea of a mandatory cap on public school spending increases has become a major pillar of New Hampshire Republicans’ response to high property taxes. The original HB 675 would have restricted the annual budgets of school districts to increase from the year before only by inflation. In order to override that universal budget cap and pass a budget with spending increases, residents in those school districts would need a two-thirds supermajority vote, the bill stipulated.
Republicans have framed the bill as a necessary correction to years of increasing school budgets and rising local property taxes. They’ve said the caps would force school boards to be more thoughtful with any proposed budget increases given the need to convince a supermajority of voters to approve them.
“The number one issue I hear from voters and residents and neighbors is that our property taxes are just getting out of control,” said Sweeney in a speech on the floor. “It’s pricing seniors out of their homes. It’s making it harder for young families to buy into the New Hampshire market.”
Sweeney said residents have not seen relief. “They just go into the school districts where they just continue to propose higher budgets, because they take the money that the state sends them, they lightly increase their tax rate as much as they can before people really start to revolt, and the spending keeps going up and up and up,” he said. “Something has to give.”
But Democrats have slammed the idea as anti-democratic and a threat to local control. They’ve noted that all recent school district budget increases were approved by majorities of voters at annual meetings, and that voters already have the ability to adopt tax caps in their individual school districts if they want. Instead, Democrats have called for the state to contribute more funding to local schools, arguing that could help reduce property tax burdens. 
“The real harm done by this bill will be felt in the overcrowded public school classrooms by … the 90% of Granite State kids who are there, where they have fewer educational opportunities despite their community’s desires,” said Rep. Mary Hakken-Phillips, a Hanover Democrat, speaking on the House floor. 
The House added a number of last-minute floor amendments to the bill Thursday.
But the final — and crucial — amendment changed the bill from a broad cap on new spending in future school district budgets to a state requirement that school boards devote no more than 6% of their budgets to administrators. That amendment was sponsored by three Republican representatives: Lorie Ball of Salem, Ralph Boehm of Litchfield, and Joseph Barton of Littleton. 
Speaking in favor of that amendment, Rep. Kristine Perez, a Londonderry Republican, noted that she and other residents in her conservative town had recently advocated for a local tax cap. But voters ultimately decided to direct the school board to study the issue first, and the resulting study convinced Perez that a tax cap is not an ideal way to restrain spending. 
“We all agree that property taxes are rising too fast and school budgets are the largest driver. The real question before us now is how do we apply restraint without harming classrooms or stripping away local control,” Perez said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0690-1024x560.jpg,,,2026-01-08 13:59:22.184639

Oneida tribal leaders in Wisconsin announced they would end a contract to build ICE facilities with a the Oneida Engineering Science Construction Group and apologized saying they were previously unaware of the agreement. | Getty ImagesOneida Engineering Science Construction Group (OESC), a Limited Liability Company (LLC) of the Oneida Nation, is taking action to terminate two contracts it has with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to provide engineering services to at least 34 ICE facilities.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The action comes after tribal leaders only recently became aware of the contracts that OESC has through a subsidiary company: Oneida Environmental (OE) that is working in a joint venture with Stantec JV, called Oneida-Stantec JV, LLC.
In a Jan. 2 Oneida Live online meeting, Tribal Chairman Tehassi Hill said he had just learned of the ICE contracts on Monday morning, Dec. 29 through social media posts.
“I want to make sure that I clearly state that the Oneida Business Committee (OBC, the agency that runs the tribe when the tribal governing board is not in session) was not aware of this joint venture or the signing of the contract,” said Hill. “I also stand strong in my words and conviction that the business venture does not align with the nation’s values, our culture and who we are as Haudenosaunee People, and it is something the committee would have never entertained had it been made aware of this.”
Jeff House, chief executive officer (CEO) of OESC, took full responsibility for the contracts, adding  that his motives were to provide a service to ensure the ICE facilities were habitable for residents and also as a business venture to sustain the operation of the LLC’s 500 employees.
“I deeply apologize,” House said. “The decision did come to me and I green-lighted the proposals to go forward, and I know it was a huge mistake.”
House said when he made the decision he wanted  to ensure the facilities would be “up to code, making sure they meet human standards, making sure that it’s properly engineered.” And, he added, “while I don’t approve and am appalled by the ICE activities, these people are being detained and put in a facility somewhere, and what had gone through my mind was, ‘Who’s taking care of them? Who’s looking out for their best interest?’ As much as I have disdain for the ICE activities going on, that’s where my mind went, and I was flabbergasted that I didn’t reach out further and get more information.”
House said he was aware of the recent controversy involving the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in Kansas to terminate a subsidiary contract with ICE for designing large-scale migrant detention centers, and he applauded the Potawatomi Chairman for noting how Indian people had been treated by the federal government by being placed on reservations and drew parallels to ICE activities.
House said he hadn’t considered the history of tribes and detention when he pursued the ICE contracts, but was more focused on ensuring the ICE facilities would be humane facilities.
According to the Federal Procurement Data System for Oneida-Stantec JV LLC, the recent ICE contract signed on Dec. 26 is for $3.777 million, and another contract signed on Sept. 19 is for $2.601 million.
House said the immediate goal is to begin the process of terminating the Dec. 26 contract, but he noted that the Sept. 19 contract, initiated under the administration of former President Joe Biden, would be more complicated to terminate because work had already begun under that contract.
House emphasized the LLC  would sustain any loss or liability as it pursued the terminations.
To avoid potential liability to the tribe, Chairman Hill noted that the tribe doesn’t directly operate OESC or participate in day-to-day operations to maintain a “corporate veil.”
In a press release, the tribe explained the “corporate veil” is “a legal concept that recognizes a company as a separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders, and it protects shareholders from personal liability for the company’s debts and obligations (meaning the company itself is responsible for its own liabilities).”
However, the OBC does appoint members to the corporate board of OESC, and there are regular reports from the LLC to the OBC.
“It is important to reiterate that the Oneida Business Committee does not approve, negotiate or manage individual contracts of its subsidiaries,” said Hill, “and only provides high-level oversight.”
Hill read a recently passed OBC resolution that directs business decisions to reflect the Oneida Nation values and specifically states that “any employee or representative of Oneida Nation and its tribal corporations to disengage with all grant agreements and contracts that involve Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”
In the future, House said, he will keep the OBC informed of any gray areas of concern.
In 2025, House said, OESC processed $177 million in revenue and made $12 million in profit, most of which was reinvested in the LLC, with a small amount given to the tribe’s general fund. He estimated the valuation of the LLC as somewhere between $80-100 million.
House said one of his primary concerns in securing contracts, most of which are for engineering services, is keeping the LLC’s 500 employees on the job.

Free.,'We must respect and love one another': Steny Hoyer tells the US House he’s retiring,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/we-must-respect-and-love-one-another-steny-hoyer-tells-us-house-hes-retiring,,"WASHINGTON — Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer announced Thursday he will retire from Congress at the end of this year, telling colleagues from both political parties in a floor speech he made the decision with “mixed emotion and reluctant conviction.” Hoyer, who was first elected in 1981 and later became majority leader, joins the dozens of members who have announced they will not seek reelection this November. Hoyer said there is still considerable work he wants to accomplish during the remainder of his term, while cautioning lawmakers against heightened partisanship. “I am deeply concerned that this House is not living up to the founder's goal,” Hoyer said. “I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to examine their conscience, renew their courage and carry out the responsibilities that the first article of the Constitution demands.”Hoyer, 86, expressed concern the U.S. reputation among allied nations has eroded, in part because lawmakers and political leaders have stepped back from core ideals. “I fear that America is heading not toward greatness but towards smallness, pettiness, divisiveness, loneliness and disdainfulness,” Hoyer said. “We must respect and love one another. We must remember that we are not great or unique because we say we are great, but because we are just, generous and fair.”Standing ovation, hugs, handshakesThe House chamber is normally empty at the start of the day, when lawmakers are able to give floor speeches on any topic they wish, before members move on to debate and pass legislation. That was not the case for Hoyer’s speech. About 75 lawmakers rose to give him a standing ovation before he began speaking and embraced him with hugs and handshakes after he formally announced his upcoming retirement. House Democratic leaders, Republican Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Republican Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic members of Maryland’s congressional delegation and former Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin all gathered to listen to Hoyer.A couple dozen members of Hoyer’s family, including his wife, children and grandchildren, watched from the gallery overlooking the House floor. Terp, lawyer, state senator, congressman, leaderHoyer graduated from the University of Maryland in 1963 before receiving his law degree from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1966. He went into private practice but also ran and was elected to the Maryland state Senate in 1966. He was the chamber’s president from 1975 through 1979. Hoyer served as a member of the Maryland state board for higher education from 1978 through 1981. He was elected to the 97th Congress by special election in 1981 and represents Maryland’s 5th Congressional District, which covers part or all of several counties in the southern region of the state, including Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Prince George's and St. Mary's.Hoyer took on several leadership roles throughout the 45 years he’s been in the chamber. He was chairman of the House Democratic Caucus before becoming the party’s whip and ultimately the majority leader. He stepped back from leadership three years ago at the same time Pelosi stepped aside. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York succeeded Pelosi as the top Democrat in the chamber, while Massachusetts Rep. Katherine Clark became the whip, following Hoyer as the second-highest-ranking Democrat. The two watched as Hoyer reflected on his career during the nine-minute speech, telling those gathered in the chamber they are “extraordinary, decent people” who are only members of Congress because people from their communities thought they were up to the job. “The only way you got here was your neighbors said they wanted you to represent them,” Hoyer said. “With tremendous gratitude, I yield back.”",,,,2026-01-08 13:12:30.300069

When asked for a copy of the settlement, the community college directed the Iowa Capital Dispatch to submit a public records request, which was completed and no response was received by the time of publication. Drake University did not respond to requests for the agreement or comment.
Drake filed suit in federal court against DMACC in July 2024 after the community college launched a rebranding effort, claiming federal trademark infringement, unfair competition, injury to business reputation and unjust enrichment. DMACC was temporarily blocked from using the new designs. The community college filed a counterclaim for defamation, which was rejected.
According to the releases, DMACC tops the list of where students transfer from to attend Drake and the private college is “among the top five schools to which DMACC graduates transfer.” Both institutions belong to the Iowa Private Transfer Collaborative and participate in “cross-enrollment advising” to allow DMACC students guaranteed enrollment to Drake.
“Both parties look forward to continuing their long-standing partnership and shared programs in service to current and future generations of students,” both of the press releases stated.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deployed tear gas at Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis Wednesday afternoon as students were being dismissed, hours after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman a few miles away, according to the teachers’ union.
The incident occurred hours after an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis, sparking protests and a vigil that attracted thousands. 
Roosevelt High School is home to the Spanish immersion program for Minneapolis Public Schools. The student population is around one-third African American and one-third Hispanic American, according to the district.

Henifin also questioned the Mississippi Department of Health's recent results regarding the quality of the city's water. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)","After another hours-long hearing Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate said he would “deal with” his decision of whether to allow a water rate increase to move forward on Monday. The judge will have a phone call with the parties to hear their closing arguments, he said.
JXN Water manager Ted Henifin and his team of attorneys were visibly frustrated as the judge once again delayed the decision. The utility first introduced the idea of a 12% rate increase, which it says is necessary to keep Jackson’s water and sewer systems running, last February, nearly a year ago. JXN Water’s revenue for daily operations last year was about $30 million short of its need, the utility said. 
Wednesday’s hearing, the latest in a series of court sessions Wingate has held over the last few months to discuss the proposed increase, mostly saw attorneys question an expert the city of Jackson hired to review the utility’s financial records.
Michael Thomas, a former chief financial officer for both Jackson Public Schools as well as Jackson State University, testified that, if JXN Water improved its collections, it would see revenue growth “comparable” to what a rate increase would provide.
Numbers displayed in court showed the utility had greatly improved revenue collections since taking over the billing systems in October 2023. In that time, monthly revenue from water bills has nearly doubled, increasing from $4 million to about $8 million. Over the past year, the utility has stepped up collection efforts, shutting off water to thousands of accounts that were behind on payments.

Yet still, the rate of customers paying their bills stayed between 60% and 69% in recent months, records show. The improved revenue likely represents the utility collecting more payments from previously owed bills, Thomas said. 
Paul Calamita, an attorney for JXN Water, explained that collection efforts can take a while because the utility needs to ensure it can quickly turn a connection back on before shutting it off. That means the utility can only focus collections on certain neighborhoods at a time so that workers are physically present to restore connections, he said. 
Drew Martin, the Jackson city attorney, said it’s unfair for 60% of customers to bear 100% of the financial burden of the water and sewer systems. It’s also unfair for the utility to spend more than it can reasonably expect to recover from ratepayers, he argued. For example, JXN Water had already obligated over $7.5 million in monthly contacting expenses in October 2023, back when it only collected about $4 million a month from customers’ bills.

Calamita pushed back, arguing JXN Water is operating as efficiently and affordably as possible. He also disputed Martin’s point about contracting expenses, saying the utility had funds from the federal government it could use to supplement its revenue. Thomas, though, argued a company shouldn’t spend more than its “foreseeable” revenue. Last spring, the utility ran out of the $150 million of federal funds meant for daily operations, although it will soon see another $54 million originally intended for large projects. 
At the end of Wednesday’s proceedings, Jackson Mayor John Horhn said he mainly disagreed with a rate increase as the “only” solution. Horhn reiterated other avenues for relief, such as working with the state Legislature, “belt-tightening” around the utility’s expenses, and improving collections. He also said JXN Water needs a hardship process for those struggling to afford their bills. 
After the session, utility spokesperson Aisha Carson said the funding shortfalls are mostly impacting sewer service. Specifically, JXN Water is still delaying repairs to two large overflows in the city, one on Mill Street and another along I-55.  
City Council sends Wingate list of requests
The Jackson City Council on Tuesday approved a resolution sending a list of requests to Wingate. Council members Tina Clay, Kevin Parkinson and Lashia Brown-Thomas were in attendance at Wednesday’s hearing.
The requests included:

To extend Wingate’s order allowing amnesty from late penalties for customers who tell JXN Water they’re not being billed from Dec. 31, 2025, to April 30.
To order JXN Water to have in-person customer service available during business hours, from Monday to Saturday, without requiring an appointment.
To direct the utility and city to designate personnel to address billing challenges.
To require an affordability study around water rates.
To order JXN Water to send all sanitation revenue to the city and to do so on a quarterly basis moving forward. (The utuility has been withholding sanitation fees residents already paid on their water bills because the city owes about $6.4 million in upaid water bills, mostly stemming from leaks at the Jackson Zoo.)
To order JXN Water to offer a credit to the city in exchange for making bond payments JXN Water was responsible for. 
To prohibit Henifin from publicly commenting on the city’s attempts to secure alternative funding, “as such comments undermine public trust.”
To require equitable billing for customers in Byram and others outside the city limits.
To review “comparative contracting options” and “increase transparency regarding operational costs.”

Thomas, the city’s financial adviser, in his testimony said more customers would feel comfortable paying if they could more easily discuss their bill with someone in person.
Wingate said he would give JXN Water until Jan. 20 to respond to the council’s requests.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/06074532/AP24012739993750-scaled.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:59:07.823532

Jeremy Dean, a Springfield Democrat, speaks in February in the Missouri House (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri House should order a Democratic lawmaker who sent a “vulgar and sexual” message to a colleague during the September special session to stay at least 50 feet away from her, the Ethics Committee recommended Wednesday.
The committee, with a unanimous vote of its five Republican and five Democratic members during an Oct. 29 hearing, also recommended that state Rep. Jeremy Dean, a Democrat from Springfield, lose his committee seats, undergo sexual harassment prevention training and have his seat on the House floor and his parking spot moved.
The committee’s report and recommendations were made public for the first time after they were published Wednesday in the journal for the opening day of this year’s session. 
Ethics Committee Chairman Lane Roberts, a Republican from Joplin, said the recommended punishment is in line with punishments recommended during past actions of the committee. The ethics committee can recommend a range of punishments, including censure and expulsion from the House.
“Our goal here is to make sure that what we do is balanced, and part of that balance is looking back through our history, how we handled such things in the past,” Roberts said.
Dean was given 15 days to object to the sanctions and did not.
In an interview with The Independent, Dean said he did not object because he accepts that the texts were inappropriate. But he added that he thinks the ethics complaint was motivated by politics.
“It seems more to me that the Republicans saw this as an opportunity to bash a Democrat in the news while they knew that they were continuing to get bad press and losing elections across the country,” Dean said. “And so this is an opportunity for them to continue to try and hold on to the state of Missouri when they know things are going downhill for them.”
On Sept. 4, while Dean was engaged in a sit-in on the House floor, he sent a text message to state Reps. Cecelie Wiliams, a Republican from Dittmer, while she was participating in a hearing of the House Elections Committee.
Lawmakers were in special session in response to a call from President Donald Trump to gerrymander Missouri’s congressional districts to make it likely a Republican could win the 5th District seat held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat.
At the time of the text, the Elections Committee was taking testimony on a proposal to change how majorities are counted for constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
In the text, Dean included a description of an oral sex act with the president and questioned how Republicans could talk while engaged in it. The text message became public when a screenshot of it was shared on social media by former Republican state Rep. Adam Schwadron.
Dean was watching the committee meeting on an online livestream and sent another text after seeing Williams’ reaction, the report states. The report does not describe the content of the second message.
Williams “was shocked by these messages, which were unprofessional and disruptive to the legislative process,” the report states.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, removed Dean from his committee assignments and has not placed him on any committees for this year’s session.
Both Dean and Williams testified during the Oct. 29 hearing and Dean admitted sending the text, the report states.
Dean “stated that he recognized that the messages were inappropriate and unprofessional, and that he regretted sending them,” the report states. Dean “denied any intent to disrupt the legislative process, intimidate (Williams), or improperly influence her participation in the committee hearing.”
The Ethics Committee is the only House committee with equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats and a minority member vice chairman. The 10 members all approved the sanctions.
The committee’s unanimous vote shows members thought “the conduct was significantly egregious and that we needed to address it,” Roberts said. “Very serious consequences needed to be commensurate with the conduct, but again, it needed to be balanced with what we’ve historically done, so that we’re not guilty of treating one person differently than another.”
In the interview with The Independent, Dean said he sent the text to Williams because he thought he could joke with her. The are both serving their first terms in the House.
“Since the freshman bus tour, Rep. Williams and I had what I would consider a very good working friendship, and I obviously crossed the line with that text message,” he said. “I totally accept that.”
The biggest lesson learned is “that you’ve got to watch your back,” Dean said. “There are people in this city that you think are your friends, people that you can joke around with, but at the end of the day, a lot of people are here for their own political gain.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Jeremy-Dean-021125-scaled-e1758025686404-1024x614.jpeg,,,2026-01-08 12:59:07.823532

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska lawmakers voted 43-0 Thursday to suspend legislative rules to speed up the process of possibly expelling a fellow senator.
Lawmakers suspended a rule requiring seven days of notice before a hearing is scheduled. This allows the Legislature’s Executive Board to hold a hearing on Legislative Resolution 282 on Jan. 12 after the board introduced the measure Wednesday.
The Executive Board, a group of legislative leaders that serve as the human resources arm of Nebraska’s officially nonpartisan Legislature, filed the resolution pursuing the expulsion of State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
The board unanimously recommended expelling McKeon following allegations he inappropriately touched a legislative staffer, allegations he denies. The board also noted what it described as a “demonstrated pattern of behavior.”
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, Exec Board chair, said Thursday that the rule requiring seven days of notice serves an important function in informing the public of matters they might want to weigh in. However, he argued that LR 282 was not a policy matter, but a personnel issue.
Hansen said McKeon was given seven days notice of the Jan. 12 hearing in a letter Hansen sent him Jan. 5, outlining the process he planned to follow once the legislative session began. Only invited testimony will be allowed at the hearing, Hansen said, including from McKeon or his lawyer, and outside counsel Tara Paulson, who conducted the Legislature’s internal investigation.
Motion filed to expel McKeon from Nebraska Legislature

The alleged incident with the staffer prompted the Legislature’s investigation separate from a Nebraska State Patrol criminal investigation that led to McKeon being cited for misdemeanor public indecency in September.
The criminal allegation against him has since been downgraded to a misdemeanor disturbing the peace charge, to which McKeon pleaded not guilty after initially attempting to plead no contest and changing his mind.
The incident took place at an end-of-session party last spring, according to the Legislature’s internal investigation conducted by Paulson, an attorney serving as outside counsel. The staffer claimed McKeon made a joke about going to Hawaii to “get laid” and smacked her rear end after delivering the joke, according to Paulson’s report.
McKeon disputes this version of events and has previously claimed the incident was “exaggerated and mischaracterized.” In a written response to the Exec Board, McKeon argued that the board’s assertions include “material inaccuracies and unsupported characterizations.”
There was little debate Thursday on Hansen’s motion to suspend the rules. All present senators voted yes on the motion, save for State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Wendy DeBoer of Bennington and McKeon, who were present-not-voting.
DeBoer said she abstained from voting out of principle, as she is generally cautious about suspending any legislative rule. However, she said she understood why Hansen was pursuing the motion.
“It is a very close one for me,” DeBoer said.



How the expulsion process works
To expel a member of the Nebraska Legislature, first a senator must introduce a legislative resolution presenting the motion. That resolution is then referred to a committee for a public hearing.
Per the Legislature’s rules, there must be seven days between the notice of a public hearing and the date of the legislative hearing (In McKeon’s case, the Legislature is considering suspending this rule). It’s up to the committee to determine whether the public hearing will include only invited testimony, or open it up to public comment.
Following the hearing, the committee must vote to advance the resolution to floor debate. If the resolution advances, it can be scheduled for floor debate the next day.
An expulsion motion requires just one round of floor debate and needs 33 votes to remove a sitting senator. If successful, the motion would take effect immediately and the legislative seat would become vacant until the governor appoints a replacement.

(Cassie Stricker for The Texas Tribune)Faculty at Texas A&M University were told this week that roughly 200 courses in the College of Arts and Sciences could be affected by a new system policy restricting classroom discussions of race and gender, the implementation of which has already led administrators to direct a philosophy professor to remove Plato readings from a core course.
The changes are being made days before the semester begins and after some students have registered to attend.
The Texas Tribune obtained emails sent by college administrators showing the policy has already led to courses being cancelled or renumbered to remove them from core curriculum credit, with professors directed to alter course content or teach different classes.
The A&M System Board of Regents approved a policy in November requiring campus presidents to sign off on courses that could be seen as advocating “race and gender ideology” or topics related to sexual orientation or gender identity. The move followed a student’s secret recording of a professor discussing gender identity in a children’s literature class that went viral on social media, sparking conservative backlash.
Regents revised the policy in December, barring most discussion of those topics in introductory or core curriculum courses unless administrators determine the material serves a “necessary educational purpose” and approve it in writing. This set off a rapid review of courses ahead of the spring semester’s Jan. 12 start.
Emails sent by college administrators Tuesday show that an introductory sociology course on race and ethnicity was canceled, a communications course on religion and the arts was renumbered and stripped of core curriculum credit, and a philosophy professor was told to remove Plato readings and other material related to race and gender from a core course or be reassigned.
In an email to students who had enrolled in SOCI 217, Introduction to Race and Ethnicity, administrators said they “carefully considered” whether the course could comply with the revised policy and “concluded that we cannot teach this course in its present form.” The message acknowledged that students enrolled in the class for a variety of reasons and said those with a “demonstrable need” to complete the course for a degree or career goals could pursue it instead through an independent study course.
Introduction to Race and Ethnicity had drawn scrutiny in the past. Texas Scorecard, a conservative website that is widely read by elected Texas Republicans and A&M regents, published stories in September and October criticizing the course and its assigned readings and identifying the professor who taught it.
In another case, Professor Martin Peterson submitted his syllabus for PHIL 111, Contemporary Moral Issues, for review Dec. 22. On Tuesday, his department head told him he had two options: remove the modules on race ideology and gender ideology, including readings from Plato, or be reassigned to teach a noncore philosophy course. The email, obtained by the Tribune, gave Peterson until the close of business Wednesday to decide.
Peterson responded that he would revise the syllabus, saying he plans to replace the Plato readings with lectures on free speech and academic freedom.
In a statement to the Tribune, A&M said the decision did not amount to a ban on teaching Plato and that other sections of the same course that include Plato – but do not include modules on race and gender ideology – had been approved.
The course changes described in those emails followed a broader review process that College of Arts and Sciences Interim Dean Simon North discussed Monday during a regularly scheduled meeting with a group of about a half-dozen faculty members.
Three faculty members in attendance told the Tribune that when asked, North said the college had identified roughly 200 courses as potentially affected by policy restrictions.
Andrew Klein, another faculty member who attended the meeting but could not recall the specific number of affected courses, said he understood the number to be preliminary because departments across the college were working under different deadlines to submit syllabi for review.
Faculty were told some departments were in the process of renumbering courses to take them out of the core curriculum, even classes that already had students enrolled for this semester. Others would need to remove readings or discussion topics, according to Sally Robinson, a professor who attended the meeting.
Faculty can ask for an exemption if they demonstrate that topics of race and gender are core to the curricula. Robinson said North told faculty members he estimated the college would request about 30 courses to be exempt from the policy, which the university will need to accept or deny in the coming weeks.
“Everyone is worried about students and about what’s going to happen next week,” said Robinson, who is asking for an exemption for two of her courses. “It’s unclear to us, and I think it’s unclear to the college as well, how those decisions are going to get made and who actually is going to make them.”
The Tribune left a voicemail for North and emailed detailed questions but did not receive a response. Two associate deans who were also contacted did not respond.
Peterson told the Tribune that the directive he received undermines the purpose of a university as a place for open inquiry and debate.
“Plato founded the Academy, the very first university,” Peterson said. “If we cannot freely discuss Plato, we no longer have a university.”
The Texas A&M Chapter of the American Association of University Professors and the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression also criticized the move.
“This is what happens when the board of regents gives university bureaucrats veto power over academic content,” said Lindsie Rank, director of campus rights advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. “The board didn’t just invite censorship, they unleashed it with immediate and predictable consequences.”
The College of Arts and Sciences is one of 17 colleges and schools at Texas A&M University in College Station, the flagship campus that includes 11 other universities subject to the same policy.
Other public university systems are taking similar steps. The Texas Tech University System now prohibits certain race- or sex-related course content except if it is required for licensing, certification or patient care, and Texas State University administrators have urged professors to revise course descriptions and titles they consider ideological.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The FBI ousted the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from the investigation into the killing of a 37-year-old woman by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis, the head of the BCA said Thursday.
The BCA is the investigative arm of the state Department of Public Safety and typically investigates officer shootings.
The FBI did not immediately return a request for comment.
BCA Superintendent Drew Evans, in a statement Thursday, said the agency consulted with the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI, and the BCA’s Force Investigations Unit began conducting a joint investigation with the FBI.
But on Wednesday afternoon, the FBI told the BCA that the U.S. Attorney’s Office had “reversed course,” according to the BCA statement. That means the BCA will no longer have access to the case materials or the ability to conduct interviews to complete a thorough investigation.
“Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,” Evans said. “As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.”
Expelling the BCA is the latest maneuver in an ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and the state of Minnesota and has already drawn sharp criticism from local officials.
“This move from the federal government to remove our state BCA from the investigation of yesterday’s homicide in South Minneapolis is deeply concerning,” said Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, on X. “This investigation needs to be carried out with transparency, fairness, and without political influence.”

(Photo courtesy of Rose Rohrer UNM BBER)As state environment agencies remediate legacy pollution from uranium mines, one New Mexico lawmaker is seeking $50 million more to clean up a variety of abandoned sites on state land that could contaminate the state’s land, water and air.
Those sites include decades-old defunct dry cleaners, oil and gas operations and the abandoned uranium mines.
Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) prefiled a bill, which, if passed in the upcoming 30-day legislative session, would give state agencies additional one-time funding to address such sites.
Lax regulations and impermanent companies in decades past often mean state officials cannot determine the party responsible for cleanup leaving New Mexicans “holding the bag,” Steinborn told Source NM during a phone interview this week.
Steinborn called uranium mines and other polluted areas “ticking time bombs” for the state’s water and soil. In a presentation last year, the  New Mexico Environment Department found people living around abandoned uranium mines could be exposed to the equivalent of more than a decade of radiation exposure in just one year.
“People are being exposed to environmental threats that they shouldn’t have to live with, and it has been this way for decades,” Steinborn said. “Leadership is sorely needed to clean up these areas and make them safe for people, but also to bring environmental justice to local and Indigenous communities.”
Direct state intervention to reckon with the legacy of abandoned uranium mines is in the nascent stages.
Previously, the federal government was charged with cleaning up all sites related to the decades of uranium mining. In 2022, the Legislature passed the 2022 Uranium Mine Cleanup Act, which gave state agencies the power to plan for and address environmental risks.
In the 2025 session, the Legislature approved $20 million for cleaning up pollution. Environmental agencies allotted $12 million to clean up four uranium mine sites, $6 million for cleaning up two areas contaminated with petroleum and $2 million to hire attorneys to track down past owners.
Last month, the New Mexico Environment Department announced the start of cleanup operations at four McKinley County mines. The four mines stand among an estimated 1,100 scattered along New Mexico’s western edge, many on or near the Navajo Nation or Zuni, Acoma and Laguna Pueblos, the result of decades of unregulated uranium mining driven by the federal government’s demands for nuclear weapons and power.
Anti-nuclear advocates expressed optimism about the prospect of additional funding.
“It’s really a very positive move for the state to be providing some leadership at this point and hopefully for the legislature to continue to fund this effort in the future,” Susan Gordon, the retired coordinator of the Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment, told Source NM.
Leona Morgan, a longtime Diné anti-nuclear activist, told Source New Mexico in a phone call that cleanup is “better late than never,” but emphasized that the state should approach cleanup in a culturally-sensitive manner and establish permanent monitoring.
“The necessary work of cleaning up uranium contamination is going to be a long-term, maybe permanent process,” Morgan said. “So spending $50 million, $20 million is really not much, but I see it as a path forward, to what we really need: dedicated funding in perpetuity.”
State financial analysts conservatively project that addressing legacy uranium mines will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. A 2020 University of New Mexico study estimated the price tag could be “infinite,” due to the extent of possible contamination.
Additional funds would unlock further cleanups, NMED Uranium Mine Reclamation Coordinator Miori Harms told Source NM, noting that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency “technically has the jurisdiction, but they tend to prioritize their sites and these are the smaller ones that fall out the bottom. But they certainly present physical safety hazards and environmental hazards that we don’t want in our state.”
Steinborn said it was “incumbent” on the federal government to pitch in further.
“It’s great that we’re appropriating money to clean up some sites and help people out. But it’s a much bigger cost than what our state can afford,” he said.

The measure (SB 1160) is sponsored in the Senate by Ana Maria Rodriguez, who represents Monroe and a part of Miami-Dade County, and in the House (HB 889) by Susan Valdés, R-Tampa. The idea has been pushed for several years by criminal justice reform advocates. The bill says the legislation is necessary “to create an independent entity as a unit of the legislative branch of state government in order to restore public trust in the department.”
The bills come a month after an investigation into a Panhandle state prison by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that overcrowding and overstaffing resulted in a high concentration of complaints by inmates about excessive force and staff misconduct.
And they come more than five years after the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Middle District of Florida issued a report regarding Florida’s Lowell Correctional Institution, the state’s largest and oldest women’s prison. The report found reasonable cause to believe that Lowell failed to protect prisoners from sexual abuse by staff.
Nine states have created corrections ombudsman positions since 2018, while another two have created quasi-oversight bodies, according to Michele Deitch, director of the Prison and Jail Innovation Lab at the University of Texas, which runs the National Resource Center for Correctional Oversight.
“It’s greater recognition of deaths in custody, of the violence going on inside, of poor conditions,” Deitch said.
“A lot of those are coming to light through journalistic accounts and through advocates’ reports and from people who have been incarcerated, but it’s also the fact that legislators are recognizing that what we’re doing now isn’t working. There are high recidivism rates, and we’re spending a lot of money on prisons and not knowing if they’re getting anything of real value from it, given the high recidivism rates and the poor conditions.”
The Federal Prison Oversight Act in 2024 established an independent ombudsman office to investigate complaints from incarcerated people, their families, and prison staff.
The office would:

Receive, track, investigate, and attempt to resolve complaints concerning correctional facilities made by or on behalf of incarcerated persons, supporters of incarcerated persons, and the public.
Monitor and evaluate conditions of confinement and treatment of incarcerated persons in correctional facilities.
Collect and analyze data relating to serious incidents, violence, and deaths in correctional facilities.
Recommend solutions to systemic problems as well as policy changes and corrective actions necessary to “protect the health, safety, welfare, and rights of incarcerated persons.”
Provide information to incarcerated individuals, supporters of the incarcerated, and the public about the rights of those individuals.

The Legislature would create a Corrections Oversight Committee of 15 voting members to meet quarterly to advise the ombudsman. They would include four members of the Legislature and 11 members of the public representing various constituencies, including a man and woman who have previously served a prison sentence of at least three within the 10 years preceding their appointment.
The Legislature would appoint an ombudsman to a 5-year term, and he or she could be reappointed for an additional five years. The Legislature would be required to allocate $250,000 to fund the office.
Accompany legislation (HB 891/SB 1162) would create a public records exemption for correspondence and communications with the Office of the Corrections Ombudsman and the Corrections Oversight Committee.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/877e557ce702-tower.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:12:56.156231

Editor’s note: Below is an excerpt, permission of the Beacon Press, from “When It’s Darkness on the Delta: How America’s Richest Soil Became Its Poorest Land” by Mississippi author W. Ralph Eubanks, copyright 2026. The book will be released Tuesday. At 5:30 p.m. on that day, Square Books in Oxford  will host a conversation for the public by Eubanks and another Mississippi writer, Wright Thompson, about the book and the Delta. Mississippi Today Ideas also recorded a separate conversation between the two Mississippi writers you can watch at the link above.

In places of great poverty, hunger is a disease. When Jack Geiger and John Hatch began their work at the Delta Health Clinic, it didn’t take them long to recognize the depths of the Mississippi Delta’s malnutrition crisis. Hunger seemed to manifest itself like a fast-spreading virus. Public health nurses who made home visits often observed that people had little more than grits and beans to eat. One wrote that many children “live on a diet of cornbread, grits, and Kool-Aid” and that “the effects of malnutrition are staggering.” The inadequate diet of Delta residents materialized on the skin of children who were suffering from rashes, boils, dryness, and a protein deficiency that caused many of their bodies to consume their own protein tissue.
To combat rampant hunger, the two men decided to do something radical: they began to write prescriptions for food. These prescriptions for food – meat, eggs, vegetables, and milk – could be filled by a network of grocery stores in the Black community of Bolivar County, where the clinic was located, and the bill was sent to what was then called the Tufts-Delta Health Center for reimbursement. It was something Geiger learned from his time in South Africa, where dried skim milk was provided to starving children. In the South African townships where Geiger once worked, powdered milk came to be classified as medicine since – like a strong antibiotic used to fight an infection – it saved children’s lives.
Geiger and Hatch’s approach did not sit well with officials at the Office of Economic Opportunity, the agency that helped fund the clinic. They saw a doctor’s prescription only as a note authorizing the dispensing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of an actual disease, not as a directive to put food in the mouths of poor people. But Geiger didn’t budge. “If mothers and babies don’t eat, all the medicine in the world won’t work,” Geiger responded. What Geiger realized was that people in the Delta were hungry both out of extreme poverty and failed government policies regarding food. In the Mississippi Delta’s past and in its present, hunger is still a disease.
As Robert Kennedy’s 1967 trip to the Delta revealed, as farming in the region became mechanized, people were left without work and were hungry – some of them displaced from the plantations where they once worked, but all without any real economic future. Ignoring this change in economic conditions was a failure of public policy. Yet the bigger lesson of what Kennedy witnessed is not just what happened to the people of the Delta when farm mechanization took over. As historian Greta de Jong has written, “The black plantation workers who were pushed off the land by the modernization of southern agriculture were not to join the industrial working class in the post-civil rights era. Instead, they were the first to experience the transition from free labor to displaced persons that awaited millions of other workers in this new era of economic restructuring.” Kennedy may have been focused on the Delta, but he was also thinking about similar situations in other parts of the country. He witnessed how the economic restructuring of the Delta and the hunger that came with it would spread to other regions where economic shifts were also occurring, whether it was in the coal mines of Appalachia, or later in the industrial belt of the Midwest, or even in New York City’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a place that as US senator from New York he had personally observed as experiencing similar patterns of poverty.
Robert Kennedy believed in government action to confront mass unemployment, poverty and hunger, but that political ideology died with him when he was assassinated during his run for president in 1968. What replaced Kennedy’s idea of government intervention was belief in unfettered free enterprise. In the end, a blind belief in the power of market forces replaced Jim Crow laws as a way for whites to maintain economic power. Politicians like Ronald Reagan linked government social programs with economic decline rather than social justice. Government action to combat hunger and poverty came to be thought of as wasteful, and anti-poverty policies as creating an indolent class of people who would not work. Yet in the Delta and places like it, the reality was that there was little work and the work that existed could not sustain a family. The idea that people in places like the Delta were not hungry and just lazy is rooted in a myth of American individualism that only perpetuates poverty and hunger. Consequently, a new Jim Crow was born, but one that was visible only to those affected by it.

Over time, as the country moved from agricultural and industrial capitalism to financial capitalism in the late twentieth century and into the twenty first, the push toward market forces expanded from places like the Delta and spurred massive layoffs in other rural communities as well as places like the midwestern Rust Belt. Understanding what happened in the Delta helps us understand other economic developments in the post-civil rights era: the region’s economic circumstances may be particularly entwined with its long history of racial oppression, but what followed across the country links the circumstances there with structural economic changes on a national level. This happened without regard to the race of the people affected. As Delta civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer told novelist Paule Marshall in 1970, “hunger has no color line.” Hamer worked tirelessly to develop her Freedom Farm Cooperative to feed poor people in the Delta through grassroots participation. “All the qualifications that you have to have to become part of the co-op is to be poor,” Hamer proclaimed. Hamer knew the emphasis on market forces and the movement away from government intervention also knew no color line with respect to the people on whom it had an impact.
Although much has changed in the Mississippi Delta since Kennedy’s visit and the Delta Health Center’s prescriptions for food, food insecurity continues to be an issue, and food is still a political weapon. The people of the Delta may have more political power, but that power is diminished since they cannot use it to put food on their tables. Political power is concentrated at the local level, not the state or national level. Food and agricultural policies are set at the national level, and much of that power is in the hands of those who use the Delta’s rich farmland for the industrial farming of corn, cotton, and soybeans. Those with power have little interest or incentive to grow food to feed the region’s residents. The children and grandchildren of many of the families Kennedy visited continue to struggle to get food on the table – and the food that they can get is largely processed and high in fat.
In the years since the beginning of farm automation in the mid-1960s, the communities of the Mississippi Delta have experienced health inequities intertwined with discrimination, poverty and racial exclusion. In three Mississippi Delta counties that Kennedy visited = Bolivar, Washington, and Sunflower, whose aggregate population is roughly a hundred thousand = over 65 percent of residents identify as Black or African American and about 30 percent live at or below the poverty level, more than 50 percent of women and 40 percent of men living in these counties have obesity, and the rate of diabetes is 13.5 percent. All eighteen of the counties that comprise the Mississippi Delta are characterized by high levels of poverty, high prevalence of chronic disease, and mortality rates that significantly exceed the national average. In addition, mortality rates in the Delta have increased over the past 40 years while the national rate has decreased. In 2017 the death rate in the Delta from heart disease was the highest in the country, and it remains one of the highest today.
President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty promised to end hunger in America by making issues related to poverty and hunger the “urgent business of all men and women of every race and every religion and every region.” But in the Mississippi Delta, with its legacy of a plantation economy rooted in white supremacy, the eradication of hunger threatened the region’s politics. What the Delta reveals is not the failure of Johnson’s War on Poverty, but the ways farm policy – particularly farm subsidies – undermined those War on Poverty policies that could have had a long-term impact on the health of Delta residents and all poor Americans.
Where the War on Poverty did fail was in its architects’ and planners’ inability to predict changes in the economy that lowered employment and distributed economic growth unevenly. If economic growth had continued from the 1970s on, poverty rates would be much lower today. Consequently, there would have been fewer hungry people in the Delta. The failure narrative that blamed poverty on the poor in Mississippi – and across the United States – only reflects the success of politicians at rewriting history. Had more programs been allowed to begin and flourish in the Delta, the War on Poverty might have rattled some of the structures that created the region’s poverty and kept its citizens poor and hungry. Resistance was in the air, and that was exactly why Mississippi did not want the programs in place. White Mississippians did not want to disrupt the status quo. Once again, the Delta was left behind, along with poor people across America. And the mythology that some of the neediest people in the nation were lazy and just needed to get to work began to take shape and flourish. Ronald Reagan famously noted that America “fought a war on poverty and poverty won.” But a close look at the history of the enactment of Great Society programs in the Delta reveals that the Mississippi political power structure fought against the very changes those programs sought to confront.
The War on Poverty is often thought of as a program that tripled federal expenditures on health, education, employment and training, and economic security programs, all important to the Delta and other impoverished regions of the country. What is less well known is that the War on Poverty was also linked with the 1964 Civil Rights Act and leveraged federal funds to push for desegregation. This gave the government the ability to pressure local governments to reduce racial discrimination and segregation, turning them into pocketbook issues rather than social ones. That is why Mississippi’s congressional delegation fought so hard against the War on Poverty, including access to food.
Three powerful Mississippi legislators—John Stennis, James Eastland and Jamie Whitten—manipulated policies and programs at the intersection of agriculture, food, health, and welfare to maintain white supremacy and to thwart any efforts toward Black advancement in the Delta. The intense desire these men had to maintain white supremacy in the Delta led to policies that affected people far beyond it. But it is through the actions of Congressman Jamie Whitten that this desire to imprint white supremacy on public policy can be seen most profoundly.
Even before the Civil Rights Movement, Whitten had worked against the progress of Black Mississippians, particularly Delta residents. Beginning in the 1940s, Congressman Whitten used his legislative power to block several U.S. Department of Agriculture studies that attempted to identify economic problems facing Black army veterans returning from World War II to the South. The impact of Whitten’s legislative maneuvers also helped keep Department of Agriculture farm policy from considering the impact of its programs on sharecroppers or farmworkers. In the 1960s, Whitten used his power to ensure his district received $23.5 million in individual farm subsidies to reduce cotton production. These subsidies went to 0.3 percent of the population, yet in the same district, the 59 percent of the population living in poverty received only $4 million in federal food relief. This imbalance perpetuated poverty, food insecurity, and hunger.
Whitten also killed a federal program designed to teach displaced Black sharecroppers and farmworkers how to drive tractors and use the tools of farm automation that were displacing them. Rather than training people for the jobs that were part of the new agricultural economy of the Delta, Whitten effectively barred an entire group of people from those jobs. When Mississippi was placed on a Department of Agriculture list in 1967 that would have surveyed hunger in the state, particularly in the Delta, he got Mississippi removed from the list, which prevented millions of dollars of food aid from coming to the state and, thus, made living conditions in the Delta worse. The domination of politicians like Whitten supported the protection of wealthy white rural farmers in the South and fueled the resistance to civil rights and anti-poverty projects that could have changed the fortunes of the poor in the Delta and across the country. He was critical of programs like food stamps and opposed lowering their cost – on the basis of their income, recipients of food stamps purchased a monthly allotment sufficient to feed their family – arguing that “when you start giving people something for nothing . . . I wonder if you don’t destroy character more than you might improve nutrition.”  Never did Whitten acknowledge that farm subsidy checks for Delta planters were their own form of welfare, but only for the rich. Whitten’s legacy was to inextricably link federal farm, food, and welfare policy in ways that harmed poor people everywhere and not just in the Mississippi Delta.
Whitten’s power to control food policy persisted into the 1970s, which meant that Mississippi was excluded from any government-based intervention plans related to hunger and food insecurity even after Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society programs were being dismantled. Whitten’s drive to control national and state food policy contributed to the failure of the War on Poverty in the Delta. It also reveals the overlooked connections between food, white supremacy, hunger and poverty during the Civil Rights era. The logic of politicians like Whitten seems to have been that the only way to stop Black progress was to starve Black people.
Today, in the poorest state in the union, just under 1,600 families receive cash payments, even though over 100,000 families live under the federal poverty line. Cash assistance reaches only 4% of poor families in Mississippi who qualify for aid. Through a historical lens, the story of the Mississippi Delta begins to come into focus as a story of how we as a nation have failed the poor and allowed them to descend even deeper into poverty. The Mississippi Delta is not the poorest place in Mississippi or perhaps the entire nation because of the failures of its residents. It is poor by the design of its political leaders at the state and national level.

Former Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin is back in court making another effort to keep his estranged, adopted son from intervening in his divorce case.
In a pleading filed Wednesday with the Kentucky Court of Appeals, Bevin’s lawyers are asking the court to vacate a ruling from Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson that Jonah Bevin, now 19, may intervene in any settlement reached by the wealthy ex-governor and his former wife, Glenna.
The appeals court in October had rejected an appeal of the matter by the Bevins, saying such an appeal could not be pursued until the case was resolved in family court.
While the Bevins’ divorce was finalized in March 2025, a proposed settlement remains pending while Jonah seeks to be a party, arguing he was neglected, deprived of an education  and sent to an abusive child residential center in Jamaica at 17.
Jonah is among four children the Bevins adopted from Ethiopia. They also have five biological children; all but one are adults.

Matt Bevin’s pleading argues that the family court’s ruling permitting Jonah to intervene — seeking educational services and child support — is clearly erroneous.
“Simply stated, there is no law in Kentucky that allows a child to intervene in his parents’ divorce case,” said the pleading styled as a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking emergency relief from a lower court.
But lawyers for Jonah said the action filed by the one-term Republican ex-governor is yet another delaying tactic.
“This is another attempt by this disgraced governor . . .to leverage the court system to conceal his conduct or delay access to justice and accountability,” said a statement from Jonah’s lawyers, John Helmers and Melina Hettiaratchi. “This is not the act of a family-focused man.”
It added that Bevin is using “extremist talking points” to deprive Jonah of resources, stating “Jonah simply seeks the support he is entitled to under Kentucky law and in the eyes of any caring parent.”
Bevin, a conservative Christian, ran for governor in 2015 on a campaign of promoting adoption and foster care, often citing his own family’s experience.
The Bevins’ lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Matt Bevin’s pleading states that unless the appeals court intervenes, allowing Jonah to intervene in the divorce settlement would cause “great injustice and irreparable injury” to the Bevins. It also “would create a dangerous precedent in Kentucky divorce cases going forward,” it said.
But Dawn J. Post, a New York lawyer and child advocate who first intervened to help Jonah after he was removed from the Jamaican facility, said the only danger is to Jonah if he is excluded from the case.
“Jonah continues to struggle today as a direct result of years of abuse, coercive control, institutionalization, abandonment, and effective disappearance during his childhood,” Post said in an email. “If irreparable harm exists here, it is not the product of judicial deliberation. It is the result of years in which a child’s needs were subordinated, his welfare marginalized, and his existence treated as an obstacle rather than an obligation.”
Post has said in a court filing that she spent three weeks in Jamaica in 2024 working on behalf of the youths removed from a brutally violent facility, including Jonah, and said the Bevins were the only parents who did not “engage” with the U.S. embassy or Jamaican child welfare authorities to assist in the care and return of their child to the United States. The case attracted international media attention after hotel heiress and celebrity Paris Hilton — an advocate for children in the so-called “troubled teen” industry — flew to Jamaica to aid the youths.
Bevin’s pleading also asks the court to rule before a family court case scheduled for March 27, saying it would cause “unwarranted public scrutiny regarding private family issues.” 
It added: “The divorce case has already garnered substantial attention from the media and general public, and that attention will only intensify if there is a public hearing pitting the former governor of Kentucky and his ex-wife against their adult son.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/BEVIN-IN-COURT-1024x727.jpg,,,2026-01-08 12:12:56.156231
