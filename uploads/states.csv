(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.)Food shelves are facing a double crisis: cuts to direct funding and food shipments, and cuts to SNAP, the federal program that helps keep people out of food shelves by helping them buy food.
The GOP mega-law passed by Republicans in Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 will cut funding for SNAP by around 20%, or $187 billion over 10 years. 
U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison, who represents the west metro, visited Second Harvest Heartland headquarters in Brooklyn Park Monday to highlight the impact of the cuts. 
“Why did President Trump and the Republican majorities cut SNAP and leave Americans hungry again? …It was to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest,” Morrison said. 
The SNAP cuts come from expanded work requirements for parents of teenagers and people between the ages of 55 and 64; changes to how utility and internet bills are counted against an applicant’s income when determining benefits; and shifting costs to the states.
Minnesota, which is facing a budget deficit in upcoming years, could be on the hook for $86 million annually, plus another $40 million earmarked to defray administrative costs of the food program.
“We are seeing more families, more seniors, and more working adults asking for help finding food — and now with the cuts from the one big bill, we are bracing for even more desperation,” said Mesa Siebert, who manages the SNAP outreach program among others at Second Harvest Heartland. 
Families continue to struggle with food inflation, which was nearly 24% between 2020 and 2024, according to federal data. 
Dan Narr, executive director of ICA Food Shelf in Minnetonka, said donations are declining even as more families are visiting the food shelf. 
The GOP law also effectively eliminated the SNAP-Ed program, which educated SNAP recipients on healthy eating and how to lead a physically active lifestyle. Those cuts resulted in 60 layoffs at the University of Minnesota last month, the Minnesota Daily reported. 
The Trump administration has also canceled shipments of food to organizations including Second Harvest.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P1241067-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-08-18 21:56:59.661888

Eastern Montana saw thunderstorms last week, which National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Chambers said caused a few new fire starts. He said there were about 4,000 lightning strikes in the area during those storms. 
Some of the fires grew throughout the week. Weather is expected to be warm across the state during the next few days, said Chambers, who is based in Billings.
“It will bring an increased potential for those fires to grow and expand in places where they’re not under control,” Chambers said Monday morning. “But right now, the one thing that we’re missing from all of this is a strong wind event.”
Sustained wind can be a serious problem for fire crews, as it can create new spot fires or push flames over a containment line. High winds can also ground aircraft, meaning firefighters may not be able to get aerial support.
“So far, over the last little bit, it looks like the land management agencies have been getting on those fires pretty good,” Chambers said. “We haven’t seen them get too out of control at this point. So as long as those are fairly contained and we don’t have any big wind events, I think we’re going to be OK.”
Northeast Montana is under a Heat Advisory until Wednesday evening, with day time highs expected to be between 95 and 105 degrees.
Chambers said motorists should take caution, making sure they aren’t dragging chains or running their cars in tall grass. Anything that creates sparks can be dangerous, he added, and even harvesting fields needs to be done with caution.
“Also, welding becomes an issue at this time of year, people are outside doing some work on cars or whatnot, and welding sparks can cause fires,” Chambers said. “So just be extra careful over the next few days, and then we have improved conditions as we go into Thursday, Friday.”
 Mission Butte

Working the Mission Butte fire, burning in grass, BIA Forestry and Wildland Fire Management Crow Agency’s Randy Pretty On Top said fire crews were paying attention to the weather. That fire is burning about five to seven miles east of St. Xavier.
Pretty On Top added the Mission Butte fire was about 6,000 acres, burning in rolling hills and gullies. Crews were working to contain the fire, he said.
“It was primarily a fire that started in the rough terrain, and then it started spreading all over the place,” Pretty On Top said. “And accessibility is a problem.”
 Windy Rock

The Windy Rock fire, near Garrison, moved to 848 acres on Monday and was listed as 0% contained. The DNRC’s County Assist Team under incident commander David Hamilton is on that fire. All public lands in the area are closed, a Monday press release from the fire said.
Almost 100 more personnel were assigned to the fire during the weekend, which is now staffed by 216 people. Two helicopters were assigned to that fire on Monday, which was estimated to have cost $1.2 million to suppress so far. Fire costs are shared by state and federal governments and are divided at the end of the year.
Officials held a community meeting in Avon about the fire during the weekend. There are numerous structures near the fire.
Crews on the southeastern flank of the fire were scouting and conducting structure assessments and planning. On the northwest side of the fire, crews were digging hand lines. 
The fire had seen some precipitation, but was still active, creating spot fires and torching trees. Wind gusts reached 40 to 50 mph from isolated thunderstorms, according to Monday’s fire report.
 McAllister

The McAllister fire, burning 3 miles south of Norris and 3 miles north of Ennis Lake, was listed at 3,500 acres and 30% contained on Monday. More than 100 firefighters have been assigned to that incident, as well as one helicopter.
The fire was first reported late in the afternoon on Aug. 16. and DNRC is currently managing the fire. Crews were working to establish lines around the fire on Monday.
There are evacuation warnings in effect for the fire: All residents in the area between Bradley Creek, Shining Mountains West and US Highway 287 (between mile markers 61 and 64).
A situation report for the fire asked motorists to use caution when driving through Norris to get to Ennis on Highway 287 — equipment is staged near that area.
 Other incidents

The Bivens Creek and nearby Cloudrest incidents, burning in remote areas of the Tobacco Root Mountains, both grew over the weekend. 
The Bivens Creek fire was nearing 2,000 acres, while the Cloudrest incident was listed at slightly over 1,100 acres and are about 15 miles northwest of Virginia City. Both were lightning caused and are being managed by Northern Rockies Complex Incident Management Team 6.
There is a public meeting for those two fires at 7 p.m. on August 19 at the Sheridan Fire Station, located at 3284 Highway 287 South. Smoke may impact Pony, Harrison and Bozeman, a press release for the fire said.
About 140 personnel were assigned to those two fires, which included areas with hazardous trees. Dangerous fire weather over multiple days was also a concern for crews on those two incidents.

A federal trial judge in Florida has ruled that the state’s law banning books deemed “pornographic” from school libraries is, in part, “overbroad and unconstitutional.”
Carlos Mendoza, a President Barack Obama-appointed judge in the Middle District Court of Florida, issued a summary judgement in a lawsuit filed by book publishers against the 2023 law, HB 1069, this week.
The suit, filed a year ago, asked the court to deem the state’s interpretation of “pornographic” and content that “describes sexual conduct” unconstitutional.

“By leaving these items undefined, Florida has given parents license to object to materials under an ‘I know it when I see it’ approach,” Mendoza wrote in his 50-page judgement, referring to a lack of definition for “pornographic” and “describes sexual conduct.”
Publishers Penguin Random House, Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, Macmillan Publishing, and Simon & Schuster argued the law removes books without considering their literary or artistic value.
The law, Mendoza wrote, “does not evaluate the work to determine if it has any holistic value,” a key part of the legal standard to determine whether material is obscene.
“Educators must again perform statutory interpretation on the fly to determine what exactly is ‘inappropriate’ or ‘unsuitable’ because those terms go undefined. All the while, the specter of harsh penalties looms in the background,” Mendoza wrote.
Especially recently, the Florida Department of Education has made public threats and called superintendents in front of the state Board of Education to explain why certain materials are in school libraries.
Also on the plaintiffs’ side were The Authors Guild, John Green, Jodi Picoult, and other authors and parents.
Mendoza listed various books involved in the suit, including “The Color Purple,” “I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,” “Paper Towns,” “The Kite Runner,” “The Handmaid’s Tale,” “Water for Elephants,” and “Homegoing.”
“None of these books are obscene,” Mendoza wrote.
Mendoza determined “pornographic” in law is synonymous with “harmful to minors.”
A Florida Senate committee this year debated further defining what school boards should consider “harmful to minors” but after First Amendment concerns arose, the bill stalled.
Dan Novack, an attorney representing the publishers called it “a sweeping victory for the right to read, and for every student’s freedom to think, learn, and explore ideas,” in a statement to the Phoenix.
“We are elated that the federal court in Florida has upheld the First Amendment rights of students, educators, authors, and publishers. The Court ruled that books may only be removed from school libraries if they lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value when considered as a whole,” Novack said.

The Senate confirmed her appointment as secretary of the Department of Human Services on Friday. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders named Mann as secretary designate when Kristi Putnam stepped down in July to return to Kentucky. Mann had been deputy secretary of programs and Medicaid director at DHS.
She will continue to serve as Medicaid director, according to an agency press release.
Mann was sworn in by Arkansas Supreme Court Associate Justice Cody Hiland in a ceremony at DHS headquarters attended by her husband Doug and colleagues, the press release said.
“It is a true honor to lead this agency, and I look forward to continuing to uphold DHS’ mission of protecting the vulnerable, fostering independence, and promoting better health,” Mann said. “I am grateful to Gov. Sanders for the trust she has placed in me, and I’m excited to work with our amazing teams to best serve beneficiaries all across this state.”
Mann has worked in the public and private sectors for multiple states and clients, including within DHS and in Mississippi. 
She holds a bachelor of science degree in accounting from the University of Alabama and is a Certified Public Accountant. She has been married to Doug for over 32 years and has two grown children, Sydney and Will.

(Courtesy of Christian Espinosa Torres campaign)OMAHA — Christian Espinosa Torres, currently assistant director of the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department, announced his bid this week to become the first newly elected Douglas County treasurer in 20 years. 
The post was vacated two months ago when John Ewing Jr. — who was first elected treasurer of Nebraska’s most populous county in 2006 — resigned after 18 years to take the reins of the City of Omaha. Ewing was elected Omaha mayor in May, and in June the Douglas County Board named Tim Cavanaugh, who previously worked in the office, as interim treasurer.

In tapping Cavanaugh, county board members said he told them he would not seek election to the four-year term.
Espinosa, a Democrat, is the first to announce a run for treasurer, essentially the county’s banker who oversees the collection of taxes. It marks his first bid for elected public office. Whoever wins the treasurer seat in November 2026 will be sworn in the following January.
In an interview with the Nebraska Examiner, Espinosa said he would work to make the Treasurer’s Office and its mission more understood and accessible to the public. For example, he said he wants a more interactive website so county residents understand more fully where their tax dollars go and how they are used.
Espinosa said he wants to find a way to save county residents the transaction fees they pay to companies when they use a credit card to pay county taxes. 
“My career has been dedicated to advancing economic development, supporting small businesses and ensuring that public resources serve the entire community fairly and effectively,” Espinosa said. “As treasurer, I will ensure that public funds are managed and invested with the highest standards of integrity, transparency and responsibility.”
Espinosa, 45, has worked in the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department since 2017. For the past two years, he’s been assistant director, overseeing such initiatives as the Small and Emerging Business Program and the Economic Sustainability Program. 
He said his work managing budgets, evaluating contracts and ensuring regulatory compliance reflects the skills needed to oversee public funds.
Espinosa has an undergraduate degree in economics and earned a master’s degree in sociology from the University of Northern Iowa. He said the treasurer job would allow him to put his economic expertise and community service to use in a position with broader reach. 
His previous jobs included being a congressional staffer working with small business and economic development for the late U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford, D-Neb. Prior to that, he directed a get-out-the-vote program for the Heartland Workers Center, was a researcher for the University of Nebraska at Omaha’s Office of Latino-Latin American Studies and served in the protection department of the Consulate of Mexico’s Omaha office. 
His volunteer service includes roles as chair of the Nebraska Early Childhood Collaborative Board, member of the NU Institutional Review Board and as an advisory board member for the Greater Omaha Chamber’s REACH program.

,WyoFile,2025-08-18 23:13:36+00:00,WyoFile,"Ranchers, landowners, conservatives urge Supreme Court to hear Wyoming corner-crossing case",Angus M. Thuermer Jr.,,,,,https://wyofile.com/ranchers-landowners-conservatives-urge-supreme-court-to-hear-wyoming-corner-crossing-case/,"

Three livestock groups, a Montana property association and a conservative group ask justices to consider the case, which pits property rights against public access.
The post Ranchers, landowners, conservatives urge Supreme Court to hear Wyoming corner-crossing case appeared first on WyoFile .","Five groups are supporting Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman’s petition for the U.S. Supreme Court to review a 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that he cannot block the public from corner crossing to reach public land surrounded by his ranch.
The groups filed briefs Monday urging the Supreme Court to take up the matter. The 10th Circuit ruled earlier this year that four Missouri hunters did not trespass when they corner crossed to hunt on public land on Elk Mountain in Carbon County.
Eshelman wants that ruling overturned, claiming that the hunters trespassed. They did not touch his land but passed through the airspace above his property.
United Property Owners of Montana, The Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, Wyoming Stock Growers Association, Wyoming Wool Growers Association and Montana Stockgrowers Association joined Eshelman on Monday in seeking a high-court review.
Corner crossers step from one piece of public land to another where they meet at the common corner with two pieces of private property. Corner crossers do not set foot on private land, but they pass above it.
“There is a need for a nationwide rule addressing corner crossing.” John Gabel Connors
At issue is public access to 2.4 million acres of public land in Wyoming and 8.3 million acres across the West that would be “corner locked” and inaccessible to the public if the Supreme Court sides with Eshelman. By controlling access at common corners, a landowner can essentially have exclusive use of public property, the Missouri hunters have said.
The 10th Circuit decision applies to Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. But it leaves a gray area elsewhere in the West, Eshelman’s supporters say.
“The outcome of this case affects 150 million acres of public and private land,” John Gabel Connors wrote in a brief for Montana landowners. “There is a need for a nationwide rule addressing corner crossing, and this case may be the only opportunity for the Court to consider the issue.”
Unconstitutional?
The groups suggested numerous reasons for the Supreme Court to take up the issue. The three ranching associations also urged justices to reverse the lower-court decision.
Attorneys argued that the 10th Circuit decision was an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation. The appeals court, however, said the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act prevented Eshelman from blocking public access to public land in the checkerboard area of Wyoming.
Eshelman never had a right to exclude others and so there was no taking, according to the ruling.
That rubs Montana landowners the wrong way.
“The fundamental flaw in the decision … is the Tenth Circuit’s belief that the UIA ‘permit[s] limited trespass’ and ‘functionally operates like a limited easement’” the brief states. The lower court concluded that corner crossing was legal and Eshelman “was not entitled to compensation for the property right that had been taken.” That “taking” is unconstitutional, the group said.

The 10th Circuit ruling also opens “previously inaccessible property” to the public, creating headaches for federal and state governments and even limiting the federal government’s power to purchase public access easements, the brief says.
In another brief, the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence reached back to English common law in its arguments. “[T]he ‘poorest man’ in the meanest hovel can deny entry to the King,” John Eastman wrote of the foundation of the United States’ legal framework.
“The natural right to own and use property … is a foundation of individual liberty,” Eastman’s brief states. “One of the core principles of the American Founding is that individual rights are not granted by majorities or governments but are God-given and inalienable.”
The 10th Circuit decision allows corner crossing in the checkerboard area of southern Wyoming where the government granted land to enable railroad construction. That created the pattern of alternating square-mile sections of public and private land and the ongoing embroglio.
“Congress created the patchwork mess,” Eastman wrote, “it can fix it as well.” That would be by purchasing easements, he argues.
Ranchers see disruption
Stock growers leaned on potential damage to ranchers and cases known as Leo Sheep and Camfield.
In the Leo Sheep conflict, courts concluded the federal government did not have a right to construct a road across a common corner because the road was partly on private property. In Camfield, fences constructed on private land wrongly prevented access to public grazing pasture, courts decided.
The Camfield decision essentially abated a nuisance and is centered on laws preventing such things, attorney Brandon Jensen wrote for the stock and wool growers. But Leo Sheep addresses implied easements.
The Leo Sheep precedent rejected an implied easement at common corners, albeit for a road. “Certiorari must be granted to provide necessary clarity on the application of existing legal reasoning and Leo Sheep’s effect on precedent under the UIA,” the brief states.
“The [Montana Stock Growers Association] believes corner-crossing is a serious threat to the integrity of private landownership, undermines long-standing property boundaries, and may set a harmful precedent that erodes the ability of landowners to manage and protect their property,” Jensen’s brief states.
The 10th circuit unleashed chaos, the brief suggests.
“Without a systemic and strategic method to acquire access to corner locked federal lands, the public will have access to lands that the state and federal government may not regulate or maintain,” the filing states.
Public access to public lands “can cause great stress to livestock,” stock growers said. Ranchers will be shouldered with “the burden to absorb the costs to their livestock operation if livestock are disturbed or livestock is lost to an errant hunter’s shot (which certainly happens); the burden to clean up the public lands intermingled with their private lands from trash, empty cartridges, plastic water bottles, gut piles and waste which can attract predators that may also choose to prey on livestock.”
The 10th Circuit decision also creates a gray area with respect to liability, the filing states.

Congress’ recent paring back of federal food programs will impact New Mexico’s food from the farm to the table, state officials told lawmakers Monday.
At a Las Cruces hearing, state agency deputies overseeing New Mexico’s agriculture, food assistance programs, school lunches and senior care told the interim Water and Natural Resource Committee cuts will likely deepen children and senior hunger.
However, the full impacts of the Congressional spending bill signed by President Trump in July remain uncertain, they told lawmakers, as some cuts go into effect immediately, but others are implemented in later years.
State lawmakers have met over the summer to address cuts to federal programs like Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) as New Mexico ranks the highest enrollments per capita in both programs. Members of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office has said she will call a special session in late August or September to address federal policies.
Just over one in five New Mexicans — 457,655 participants — use SNAP benefits and nearly 40% are children. Niki Kozlowski, the acting deputy secretary for the state’s Health Care Authority told lawmakers that cutting eligibility and stricter enforcement of work requirements will likely worsen outcomes for low-income children.
“We have a very high rate of child food insecurity, about 23%, which we do believe is likely to worsen due to the downstream impacts of this bill,” Kozlowski said.
While $5.5 million of the cuts to school SNAP programs are not immediate, the state is working to transition schools to a different federal program, said Michael Chavez, the senior manager for student success and wellness at the state’s education department.
“We’ve got to stay ahead of the curve of what these cuts are going to be,” Chavez told Source NM.
The state’s senior population also has the fifth highest poverty rate in the nation with 64,000 New Mexicans over 60 years old receiving SNAP benefits as of fiscal year 2022.
“The impact of funding cuts, although unknown, is very alarming for this population because we do know that our aging population is growing and they’re in need,” said Denise King, who directs aging network services for the New Mexico Aging and Long-Term Services Department.
Reduced federal funds will impact state programs for produce safety inspections and climate funding for sustainable farming, Les Owen, the deputy director at the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, said.
The 40% reduction in the federal budget will not impact actual inspections of produce, but will limit how much outreach and education the agency can do. Owen also noted the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled hundreds of  millions of dollars in funding, which impacted a few programs in New Mexico for soil health and reducing carbon in ranching.
Originally, New Mexico was awarded funds for 22 projects according to a USDA dashboard, but Owen said he didn’t have a full figure of the grant cuts when reached by Source NM.
“All of these changes, the shake-ups and the reorganizations have created just a tremendous amount of uncertainty,” he said.

Union and management agreed on a contract Monday, Aug. 18, but it still needs to be ratified by union members. Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)After three months on the picket line, Butler Hospital’s unionized workers have reached a tentative agreement with the psychiatric facility and its owner, Care New England.
According to a joint statement from Butler’s President Mary Marran and Jesse Martin, the executive vice president of SEIU 1199NE, the two parties have arrived at satisfactory agreements for union workers of all pay grades. 
“On behalf of both Butler Hospital and members of the bargaining committee representing all job classifications of the hospital, we are pleased to share that a tentative agreement has been reached,” Marran and Martin wrote in a joint statement. “More details will be forthcoming in the coming days.” 
The strike, purported to be the longest hospital labor strike in state history, began on May 15, after the roughly 720 unionized members of SEIU 1199NE who work at Butler failed to acquire new contracts after the old ones expired in March. A set of four contracts covered Butler’s union workforce, which includes nurses, mental health workers, and dietary and clerical staff.  
Members of the union’s bargaining committee said multiple times that the strike’s duration continued because the lowest-paid workers, such as those in the dietary and clerical departments, would still see wages around $18 an hour, which the union argued is not a livable wage in the Ocean State. 
Care New England, meanwhile, closed three units at Butler over the strike’s duration, leaving the hospital at roughly half its capacity of around 197 beds. 
As recently as Tuesday, Aug. 12, union workers maintained at a press conference that no bargaining talks were scheduled after negotiations had failed once again the previous week. Union members also said that they had made significant movement on their end, although statements from hospital leaders offered a different interpretation of events. 
More recently, on Thursday, Aug. 14, Butler posted to its website, “As they have since the beginning of their indefinite strike, SEIU 1199NE continues to misrepresent facts about the state of negotiations …After 18 hours of negotiations last week on August 6-7, it was the federal mediator — not the Hospital — who ended the session … The union leaders, who have never worked in our hospital, are misleading the public and placing unnecessary strain on patient care.”
The agreement still needs to be ratified by union members, and spokespeople for both sides would not divulge more details Monday ahead of any final vote.
But the absence of details did not stop Gov. Dan McKee and Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley, one of the state’s top labor leaders, from issuing a joint statement.
“My office worked closely with RI AFL-CIO and Care New England to play a supportive, convening role during this process,” McKee wrote.
“Working through this dispute took a great deal of patience and a commitment to problem-solving, and both sides deserve credit for taking this step forward,” Crowley said.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)A crucial passenger rail link between central Pennsylvania, Philadelphia and New York could be in jeopardy if state lawmakers don’t act to stave off public transit cuts in the commonwealth’s largest metro area, U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-2nd District) said Monday.
Boyle said Amtrak President Roger Harris told him the loss of more than $71 million in payments from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) would severely impact Amtrak’s operations, possibly leading to the suspension of the Keystone Service.
“Many people in our area rely on the Keystone Service. If SEPTA cuts or eliminates that funding to Amtrak, that rail line will cease to operate,” Boyle said in a call with reporters Monday.
The train makes 13 daily round trips between Harrisburg and New York with stops in Lancaster, and several smaller communities in southcentral and southeastern Pennsylvania, in addition to Philadelphia. The trains, which are primarily funded by PennDOT, carried 1.27 million passengers last year, according to Amtrak. That makes the Keystone the railroad’s fifth-busiest service.

Amtrak officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Facing a $213 million deficit, SEPTA plans to reduce or eliminate service throughout its system. The cuts could begin as soon as next week if the legislature is unable to increase public transit funding in the state budget, which is now more than six weeks overdue. The reductions could impact up to 800,000 people who use the transit system daily.
The cuts to bus and rail service include the elimination of SEPTA’s regional rail routes that operate on lines owned by Amtrak. They include the Northeast Corridor between New York and Washington and the Keystone Corridor between Philadelphia and Harrisburg.
SEPTA contributed $42.3 million for capital projects including track and signal improvements and $28.8 million in operating expenses including policing and station operations, according to Boyle’s office.
By eliminating five commuter rail services that use Amtrak’s lines, SEPTA can put the cost savings toward its structural deficit, spokesman Andrew Busch said. While service on the remaining eight commuter lines is slated to be reduced by 45%, SEPTA owns those rails and would not see comparable savings by cutting them entirely.
“SEPTA does not know how the elimination of regional rail service on Amtrak-owned lines will impact Keystone Line service,” Busch said. “We understand that Amtrak will have to make decisions in the coming weeks whether to pause or postpone infrastructure projects on the Keystone Line in response to the planned elimination of SEPTA’s lease payments on Jan. 1.”
It’s also unclear whether the loss of SEPTA’s payments would affect Amtrak’s once-daily Pennsylvanian Service between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In 2023, the state won a federal grant to make improvements to tracks owned by Norfolk Southern Corp. to allow a second daily Pennsylvanian run.

PennDOT officials did not respond to a request for comment Monday. 
While cuts to Amtrak service are not a certainty even if SEPTA makes its planned cuts, the possibility shows how the public transportation crisis “puts tens of millions of dollars in serious jeopardy for the operation of Amtrak in our regions,” Boyle said. 
“It’s yet one more reason why the SEPTA funding crisis needs to end,” he said.
While SEPTA is the state’s largest mass transit agency, public transportation providers in every county have faced a financial crisis since ridership dropped precipitously during the COVID-19 pandemic. With a larger number of people working remotely since then, revenue from fares has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
At the same time, lawmakers have struggled to find reliable sources of funding for transportation generally as more fuel-efficient vehicles and the proliferation of electric vehicles have chipped away at fuel tax revenue. 
It has also highlighted the duality of the commonwealth’s urban and rural divide. Republican lawmakers have opposed more funding for transit without additional money for roads, bridges and other transportation infrastructure such as regional airports that serve rural districts.

Gov. Josh Shapiro has proposed increasing the state’s contribution of sales tax revenue to public transportation in his last two budgets to provide about $300 million more for transit. Last year, however, the compromise budget included only $80 million in additional money for transit. Shapiro redirected $153 million in federal highway funding to keep SEPTA afloat.
Despite a flurry of activity last week, the impasse between the Democratic-controlled House and Republican-led Senate appears no closer to breaking. 
House Democrats shot down a $47.6 billion budget proposal Wednesday that had cleared the GOP-controlled Senate late the night before by a party line vote, effectively prolonging the stalemate. 
The Senate’s proposal is about $3 billion less than the one that passed the House last month.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)JAMESTOWN, N.D.  – As shovels dug in for the first time Monday at the site of the new State Hospital in Jamestown, state health officials said they believe North Dakota is turning the page on addressing mental health challenges in the state.
The new State Hospital will be on 12th Avenue, directly across from the current hospital, and house about 140 beds, an increase of 19 beds from the old facility. The new hospital will be smaller, about 316,000 square feet, than the current 650,000-square-foot hospital complex.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong said the new hospital reflects the state’s focus on modernizing important public services, like mental health and addiction services.
“I will be the happiest governor in the world if those 19 beds are eventually sitting empty,” Armstrong said to the standing room only crowd at the groundbreaking ceremony. “Because that will mean we’ve successfully served people upstream, well before their cases become so acute that they require an institutional setting.” 
He said the new facility will be “safe and secure” not only for the patients, but the staff that serves them.

The state has budgeted $300 million for construction of the new facility, which was downsized from $330 million that was initially proposed by House lawmakers during the legislative session.
Dr. Eduardo Yabut, medical director for the State Hospital, said behavioral health care has changed and improved over the decades, but the facilities at the old hospital complex remain in the past.
“We’re talking about the seriously and persistently mentally ill. Those that do not do well in a private setting,” Yabut said. “If it takes three to four months, if they stay at the State Hospital for that amount of time, they never end up coming back. They do well in the community.”
The new hospital will provide the similar treatment services as the old facility, such as: short-term inpatient psychiatric treatment, substance abuse services, forensic services and secure inpatient evaluation and treatment services for individuals deemed sexually dangerous.
Other amenities that will be part of the new state hospital are: an arts room, a bank, barber, a botanical garden, chapel, fitness areas, group therapy space, a library and teaching and vocational spaces.
Yabut said the hospital focuses on rehabilitation, which is why there are amenities like a bank and library because patients need to learn how to use those services to become positive community members.
“When they get out into the community they know how to go to a clinic, know how to show up for their appointments, know how to manage their finances … that can never be replicated in an acute care hospital,” he said.

Pam Sagness, director of the behavioral health division for the Department of Health and Human Services, said Armstrong and the Legislature have invested in the new facility because they view it as important to the well-being of the state.
“It’s recognizing how mental health and looking at addiction … that we’re going to make it a priority in the state of North Dakota,” Sagness said. 
She said the new hospital will take advantage of simple things that may have been overlooked in the 1800s that can contribute to better mental health and wellbeing of a patient, like natural light.
“Being able to have natural light in your windows so as you are healing, you don’t have that darkness that you see in the older brick buildings,” she said. Sagness added it will also improve the lives of the hospital staff to only need to be in one building, instead of six buildings that make up the current complex.
“Even just little things like the outside courtyards, we’re able to have a labyrinth where you can walk and do nature trails,” she said. “And we’re looking at therapeutic things like gardening, things that other people get to do at home, that we can do in the community, but we can also do them at the hospital.”
Construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2027, according to the project website, but isn’t expected to be operational until early 2028.
“I think people have been waiting for this,” Sagness said. “This is one of those projects that, session after session, it was always discussed, but never signed, stamped and endorsed, and this time, it’s our day.”

(Photo provided by Washington State Patrol)Police in Washington are sometimes waiting over a year for the state to test firearms evidence, as the Washington State Patrol deals with a growing backlog.
For the past four years, the state patrol’s forensic crime labs in Vancouver, Tacoma, Seattle and Spokane received an average of 628 requests for testing firearms per year, according to the state patrol. But the labs are only completing 418 of those requests annually.
The state patrol says it is making strides to address the issue, which can delay trials and hinder attempts to quickly find suspects.
As of July 1, over 950 cases awaited forensic analysis of firearms, with the current wait time stretching 54 weeks. The state patrol expects the backlog to peak at more than 1,050 cases this summer as demand for testing grows.
Larger departments can do some testing on their own. This is the case for the King County Sheriff’s Office, according to Undersheriff Jesse Anderson. The sheriff’s office, Anderson said, also uses the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network to examine bullet shell casings.
But for more technical needs, King County still relies on state crime lab scientists.
Tests can include matching a bullet found at a crime scene to the exact gun that fired it. Detectives can then try to track down that gun. Scientists can also try to decipher serial numbers that a person attempted to remove from a gun to help find its owner.
But getting results back from the crime lab can take anywhere from six to 18 months, said Anderson, a former detective.
“Demand continues to grow. It doesn’t go down, it just continues to increase,” he said. “The challenge for all law enforcement agencies and forensics labs is just to be able to keep up with that workload and the expectations that the prosecutors have for building these cases.”
While awaiting testing, police and prosecutors may still have enough evidence to charge suspects, but have to wait to go to trial. In other cases, the forensics may be key to developing leads detectives can follow up on to track down a suspect.
In the past couple years, the crime lab added eight forensic scientists focused on guns, doubling capacity. But it takes two years to train them, said state patrol Chief John Batiste.
Half have completed their training and are examining firearms. As of early August, two more were on track to join the ranks this month, and the other two are expected to finish training by the end of the year.
“The bottom line is that the number of cases where firearms play a part in criminal activity has grown, and we must restructure and grow our forensics capacity,” Batiste said in a statement. “This is a process, not an event. But we are getting closer to meeting our needs every day.”

Once all the new scientists are on board, state patrol expects to reduce its firearm backlog by 35% by next July, and 60% by January 2027. The goal is to consistently finish testing within 120 days by 2028.
Anderson said he thinks the crime lab “is doing what they can to try to keep up.”
“This is just going to be a challenge all the time,” he said.
Washington State Patrol has also faced backlogs in blood toxicology as well as DNA testing, specifically for sexual assault kits. The state auditor said in December that the backlog of sexual assault testing kits had been “effectively eliminated.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Firearms-Lab-DSC_7272-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-18 19:56:39.369414

Debra Bazemore and National Alliance on Mental Illness Georgia Chapter Executive Director Kim Jones deliver letters calling on Georgia Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner John King to enforce Georgia's Mental Health Parity Act. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderMental health advocates gathered at the state Capitol in Atlanta to urge Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King to step up enforcement of the state’s mental health parity laws just a few days after King’s office announced it would fine health insurance companies $20 million for failing to comply. 
The fines, announced Friday, mark the first major instance of the state enforcing a 2022 law aimed at ensuring that insurers cover mental health care alongside its coverage for physical health.
Georgia residents have long faced barriers when it comes to seeking mental health treatment. The state ranks 47th in the nation for access to mental health care, according to an annual report from Mental Health America, and nearly 35% of adults with frequent mental distress said they could not seek care because of the cost – with Georgia ranking last on that metric.
King’s office, which is tasked with ensuring that insurance companies comply with Georgia regulations, said it found over 6,000 violations involving 22 different insurance providers. Companies can be fined up to $2,000 for every violation, or up to $5,000 per violation if they knew or reasonably could have known they were violating the law.

“The time to get in compliance with the law was yesterday,” King said in a statement Friday. “Today, we are taking decisive action to hold those who think they can skirt the law accountable.”
A spokesperson for the Office of Insurance and Safety Fire declined to name which insurers had received fines, saying that more information would become available once the final orders had been issued.
Georgia’s Mental Health Parity Act was signed into law in 2022, and was aimed at improving enforcement of a 2008 federal law requiring health insurance companies to treat behavioral health benefits on par with physical care, meaning that deductibles, co-pays or limits on the number of visits or days of hospitalization should be the same for both mental and physical services.
The law also mandates that Georgia’s Office of Insurance and Safety Fire conduct an in-depth review of insurer data and submit an annual report to the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the House of Representatives every August. This year’s report has not yet been publicly posted. 
At a rally for mental health parity outside King’s office Monday, advocates called for greater enforcement of Georgia’s existing parity law and urged King to uphold other aspects of the legislation, including a requirement that the commissioner’s office establish a separate portal for parity-related complaints.
“It’s the parity law, not the parity recommendation or suggestion,” said Jeff Breedlove, the strategic policy advisor for the Georgia Council for Recovery. “It is a privilege for an insurance company to do business in the state of Georgia and serve Georgia families, not a right. And if you want to profit off of Georgians, then you need to at the very least follow our laws.”
And while mental health advocates said they were excited by King’s announcement, many also expressed disappointment in the outcome.
“I’m a little underwhelmed by it,” said Roland Behm, one of the co-founders of the Georgia Mental Health Policy Partnership, adding that the $20 million fines will be split between the numerous insurance companies who failed to comply with the law.

“We’re looking at individual insurers bearing a cost of about a million dollars,” Behm said. “And once again, while more than I have in my checking account, it’s not really a lot of money in the context of insurers who might begin to think that the best thing for them to do is to not comply with the parity act and then just pay whatever fines might be assessed.”
Georgia state Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, a Decatur Democrat who was a co-sponsor of the 2022 measure and who attended Monday’s parity rally, said she hopes to pass additional legislation aimed at closing the gaps in enforcement when the Legislature reconvenes in January.
House Bill 612, which was introduced by Rome Republican Katie Dempsey, would create a formal mechanism to review and address parity complaints by establishing a parity compliance review panel. It would require health care providers to report suspected violations by health insurers. The bill stalled in the Senate insurance committee, but could be picked up again in 2026.
“I am grateful that we are having some demonstrable evidence from the commissioner today that we’re moving forward, but there is much more to do,” Oliver said.

State officials maintain Vermont is not a sanctuary state but received a letter Monday from the U.S. attorney general’s office alleging it has immigration enforcement policies in place the federal government sees as unlawful.
“For too long, so-called sanctuary jurisdiction policies have undermined this necessary cooperation and obstructed federal immigration enforcement, giving aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires,” reads the letter dated Aug. 13, shared with VTDigger.
Studies show immigrants in the United States commit crimes at lower rates than the U.S.-born population. Meanwhile, immigration authorities this year have been detaining and deporting record numbers of immigrants who have little or no criminal record, according to the Marshall Project.
Gov. Phil Scott is reviewing the letter from Attorney General Pamela Bondi and is preparing a response to push back on that assertion, according to Dustin Degree, a spokesperson for the governor.
“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration and enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States. This ends now,” Bondi’s letter states.
Degree rejected Bondi’s assertion Monday.
“Importantly, Vermont is not a sanctuary state. Vermont does not have any law or policy that impedes the enforcement of federal immigration law,” Degree wrote to VTDigger in an email.
“In fact, the opposite is true: Vermont State law is very clear that the State does not prohibit or impede any public agency from complying with the lawful requirements of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1373 and 1644,” he stated.
Those laws state local law or governmental entities may not prohibit or restrict the sending or receiving of information from federal authorities regarding a person’s immigration status.
Any policy or practice that existed in Vermont that conflicts with federal immigration requirements has been abolished, according to Degree.
“Governor Scott will convey these important details in a response to the AG, which we expect will be sent tomorrow,” Degree wrote.
The letter, which was sent to multiple communities, threatens criminal charges, civil action and potentially withholding federal funds if entities don’t comply.
The letter comes on the heels of the Justice Department announcing its latest list of 35 sanctuary jurisdictions, which includes Vermont, as part of the federal government’s continued effort to target communities that it believes are interfering with immigration enforcement.
An earlier list in May named more than 500 jurisdictions across red and blue states in response to President Donald Trump’s April 28 executive order directing federal authorities to identify so-called sanctuary jurisdictions nationwide that are “deliberately obstructing the enforcement of federal immigration laws and endangering American citizens.”
The whittled down list naming about three dozen sanctuary jurisdictions, largely Democratic, makes no reference to the older list which has been quietly removed from the Department of Homeland Security’s website.

(Photo by Paul Mansfield Photography/ Getty Images)Though Maine’s newly enacted food waste ban won’t start until 2030, advocates and food waste experts say the state needs to take steps in the meantime to prepare. 
Maine was the last New England state to pass legislation creating what’s known as a food waste ban, which diverts food waste from traditional waste streams by prioritizing the donation or recycling of organic material, rather than sending it to landfills or incinerators. It took multiple legislative attempts, but Gov. Janet Mills allowed Maine’s ban to become law earlier this year without her signature.
Because of a first-of-its-kind study in 2024, there is concrete data showing that more than 360,000 tons — or about 520 pounds for every person in the state — of food is wasted or lost in Maine annually. While much of that could be recovered to feed the one in eight Mainers who face hunger, it instead rots in landfills creating methane, a harmful greenhouse gas, according to a study the Maine Department of Environmental Protection asked the University of Maine’s Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions to complete. 
Proponents like Peter Blair, policy and advocacy director for the national environmental advocacy organization Just Zero, believe the ban will help the state better address its challenges managing waste, including the fact that a state-owned landfill that currently collects just over half of landfill waste in Maine is expected to reach capacity in 2028. But there is work to be done in the next few years to make sure the state is fully prepared when the new law takes effect. 
Susanne Lee, a faculty fellow at the center the completed the study, said her team at Food Rescue MAINE is already doing some of that work and doesn’t think of this new law in terms of a “ban.” Rather, she said it reinforces the idea that food is a resource and gives credence to the work that is underway to remove it from the waste stream.
“This legislation has really clarified, ‘We’re not kidding. Here in the state of Maine we see food as a resource, a valuable resource that should never be treated as waste,’” Lee said.
A recycled, refined proposal
When Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) proposed LD 1065 earlier this year, it was the third session in a row that such a ban had been introduced in the Legislature. She told the Environment and Natural Resources Committee that her bill built on the earlier bills. 
“LD 1065 incorporates and improves upon that language, offering us a polished, ready-to-go path forward,” she said during the April public hearing.  
The new law prohibits significant generators of food waste — which could include schools, hospitals, food producers and others — from disposing of food waste in traditional landfills or incinerators if they are close to a facility that could compost or otherwise dispose of the waste. It takes a gradual approach to expand the requirement based on someone’s proximity to an organics recycler and the amount of waste generated.
Previous attempts to pass a food waste ban garnered support from lawmakers, but failed due to a lack of funding. Those bills were projected to cost more than $500,000 to implement because the Department of Environmental Protection said it would need multiple new positions and other resources to get such a program up and running. 
This year’s bill seemed like it was headed for the same fate based on the department’s initial testimony on the proposal, but Brenner worked with the department to get that cost down to less than $20,000, allowing this year’s attempt to make it over the finish line. The department ultimately determined it could do the work with existing staff, but that required pushing the start date back by a few years. 
2030 start date 
Blair said the delayed start has the potential to be beneficial, but only if the state prepares for the policy in the meantime. 
If the state ignores this impending policy for the next few years, Blair anticipates issues with its roll out, so he said he would “really urge the state to start proactively getting ready to implement this.”
To do that, he’d like to see the state create a list of which businesses, grocery stores, restaurants and more will be subject to the first wave of the law and educate them on what to expect. Once those entities have been identified, Blair said the department could educate them on the harm of food waste and how to recycle or donate what they would typically throw away. 
The state Department of Environmental Protection did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.
Lee said for the past few years her team has been working with communities, schools and businesses on food waste education. The study completed last year helped quantify the issue and led more communities and schools to work with her team, she said. 
Specifically for businesses, her team has already been offering free services to track their food waste and develop solutions to mitigate it. 
The multi-year timeline gives Lee and her team the ability to work with even more entities that will be affected by the new law, figure out what it means for them and how best to prepare. That way, she said, “when 2030 comes, it’s a non-event.”
For Lee, the new law is less about telling people what they can’t do and more about teaching people alternative ways to make use of excess food, such as by feeding other people, animals or nourishing the soil. But the state also needs to have the infrastructure in place to support those behavior changes. 
Maine currently has 83,600 tons of composting and anaerobic digesting capacity, according to testimony from the department shared with the environmental committee. However, many composting facilities are at capacity, with the exception of an anaerobic digester in Exeter in Penobscot County. 
Existing composting infrastructure in the state is concentrated in southern Maine along the coast, so Blair said there is also work to be done to make composting more accessible in northern Maine, especially Aroostook County, which is an agricultural hub for the state. 
Lee echoed the fact that there are gaps in composting infrastructure throughout the state. Her team is already working with food producers in Aroostook County to encourage composting and said there is interest in increasing facilities in that part of the state. 
Now, she said they can leverage LD 1065 being on the books to help get loans or other resources to develop the resources that will be needed come 2030.

(Photo: Clayton Henkel)The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled last week that the federal courts lack jurisdiction to declare the arrest of Maurice Wells Jr. at a 2020 Black Lives Matter protest in Alamance County unconstitutional.
Wells alleged he was racially discriminated against when he was arrested by Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson and charged with disorderly conduct and failure to disperse at a July 11, 2020 protest over the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Wells was convicted of both charges in March 2021, and has appealed for a new trial before the Alamance County Superior Court, which remains pending.
In his lawsuit, Wells requested a declaration from the federal courts that Johnson violated his First Amendment rights.
Wells was arrested following an argument with supporters of Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County, a neo-Confederate group, as the BLM protesters demanded the removal of a Confederate statue at the county courthouse in Graham. His initial complaint, filed with the Alamance County Superior Court, says that members of ACTBAC, as the group is known, who also refused the sheriff’s order to disperse were not arrested.
“The plaintiff, Mr. Wells, was deprived of his constitutional rights of free speech and assembly by the defendant, Sheriff Johnson,” his attorneys wrote. “Sheriff Johnson’s actions are evidence of a practice or policy to disfavor the speech of people of color when applying and enforcing the law in Alamance County.”
In a response to the complaint, attorneys for Johnson wrote that he believed Wells to be “inciting a fight” at the protest and denied that his civil rights were violated. Johnson arrested Wells as he continuously rang the courthouse bell and refused to disperse when ordered, testifying at trial that he told Wells, “Son, quit ringing the bell or you’re going to jail. It’s time to disperse.”
“It is denied that Plaintiff’s arrest was part of a pattern and practice in which ACSO suppressed the rights of protesters to speak on matters of public concern following the death of George Floyd in May, 2020,” lawyers for Johnson wrote.
On Aug. 12, a Fourth Circuit panel made up of Judges Paul Niemeyer, Jay Richardson and Henry Floyd found Wells cannot be granted relief because he sought only a declaration that the arrest was unconstitutional, not damages, and failed to show that a declaration would protect him from future harm.
“[A plaintiff] must either allege or show that the preclusion is likely to help redress his injury by doing some work in future litigation. Wells does not,” Richardson wrote. “We therefore hold that the declaration Wells seeks does not offer constitutionally adequate redress. For this reason, Wells cannot seek it in federal court.”
The judges wrote that Wells did not show that a ruling in his favor would protect his rights going forward.
“Even if he again faced arrest and again sued, Wells does not say why Johnson is the defendant against whom he would need preclusion. Wells gives no reason to think he will again protest in Alamance County or be arrested by Johnson himself,” Richardson wrote. “Yet if he protested elsewhere or faced arrest from officers belonging to another agency, no preclusive effect from this case would help him.”
The appeals court vacated a district court ruling dismissing Wells’s case and returned it to the Alamance County Superior Court.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ConfederateMonument_AlamanceCourthouse_chenkel-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

A political action committee tied to Vermont’s sole U.S. representative — though separate from her campaign — reported thousands of dollars in donations from Google, Nike and Universal Music Group in its latest federal filing.

U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has made a point in recent appeals to supporters that she serves in Congress free from corporate influence. “Hi, it’s Becca,” she wrote in an email to potential campaign donors last month. “I don’t take corporate PAC money.”
But a recent financial disclosure filed by a political action committee Balint uses to support and win favor with other members of Congress — known as a leadership PAC — paints a less clear-cut picture of the second-term representative’s fundraising. 
Over the first half of 2025, Balint’s “Courage PAC” accepted thousands of dollars in contributions from political action committees tied to major corporations, according to its latest Federal Election Commission report.
The leadership PAC is separate from Balint’s main campaign account, or what the FEC calls a “principal campaign committee.”
According to its July 31 filing, Balint’s leadership PAC reported $13,500 in contributions over the first half of the year. More than half of that total came from political action committees linked to big-name companies: $5,000 from Nike’s federal PAC; $2,500 from a PAC tied to Universal Music Group; and $1,000 from Google’s federal PAC.
Some of those contributions came at or around the same time Balint was disavowing corporate support to potential donors. Her leadership PAC reported receiving the Google donation, for instance, on June 12; less than a week later, she wrote in an email seeking donations directly to her campaign that “unlike other politicians, Becca doesn’t take money from big corporate donors with a hidden agenda — she relies on support from people like you who pitch in $10 or $5 at a time.”
The remaining $5,000 in last month’s report came from Equality PAC, which is the political arm of the Congressional Equality Caucus and raises money to elect more openly LGBTQ+ people — such as Balint — to the U.S. House and Senate.
Balint’s leadership PAC also accepted more than $12,000 from corporate PACs during the 2024 election cycle, according to previous FEC filings. That included donations from PACs tied to Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Amazon, Paramount, Sony Entertainment and Toyota, as well as the Nike, Universal Music Group and Google-affiliated PACs.
Many members of Congress, including the two other members of Vermont’s delegation, have their own leadership PACs. Politicians often use these PACs to fundraise for other candidates within their party, which can in turn bolster their own image and influence.
Leadership PACs are legally separate from politicians’ own campaigns, though, and the former cannot directly fundraise for the latter. That’s a point Sophie Pollock, a Balint spokesperson, made in a statement to VTDigger about Balint’s PAC’s fundraising. 
“These funds are used to donate to other campaigns that the Congresswoman believes in, progressive candidates rooted in their communities, fighting for working people,” Pollock said. “To be clear, these funds do not go toward Rep. Balint’s campaign for her own reelection.”
She added that Balint sees her leadership PAC as a tool to help elect more members of Congress who will counter President Donald Trump’s administration in the coming years. Right now, Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress.
“She’s laser focused on taking back the Republican controlled House that’s doing so much damage. We must defend our democracy from Donald Trump,” Pollock said. “The stakes are too high.”
Filings show Balint’s leadership fund has contributed in recent months to Rep. Chris Pappas, D-New Hampshire, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in 2026; Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, who narrowly overcame a Republican challenge to her seat in 2024; and JoAnna Mendoza, a Democrat running for a GOP-held House seat in Arizona.
Still, the recent big-brand donations to Balint’s leadership PAC stand out compared to the list of contributors, over the same time period, for the leadership PACs used by Vermont’s Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch.
Sanders’ leadership PAC, called “Progressive Voters of America,” reported a total of $200,650 from at least 179 contributions over the first half of the year, according to FEC filings. Nearly all of those came from individual donors, filings show, while just one — $5,000 from the National Education Association, or NEA — came from a PAC.
Welch’s leadership PAC — “Maple PAC” — raised $70,500 in that time from at least 34 contributions. Most of that money came from PACs, though none are affiliated with corporations. The largest contributors, at $5,000 apiece, include PACs representing the hospitality industry, mortgage bankers, realtors, dermatologists, broadcasters, sheet metal workers and electric co-ops, according to the committee’s latest filing.
Neither of the senators’ leadership PACs reported contributions from corporations during the 2024 election cycle, either, previous FEC records show.
Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College, said it’s common for leadership PACs to take in money from many different sources, including corporations. Balint is not running afoul of any laws by spending corporate money on other candidates she likes, he said. But Dickinson added the leadership PAC’s activities could appear “in tension” with Balint’s campaign messaging, which in part entices people to donate using a pledge that she takes no corporate contributions. 
“It’s all legal. But perhaps, ethically, some might view that it tarnishes the claim not to accept corporate money,” Dickinson said in an interview. “She’s not lying in her email. But she’s not telling you the whole story.”
The latest FEC report filed for Balint’s campaign account, which is called “Becca Balint for Vermont,” also lists a handful of donations from PACs that are tied to corporations — something that would directly conflict with Balint’s campaign messaging. But Pollock said the campaign had, as of last week, rejected those donations and was returning them. (The donations made up a relatively small percentage of the total receipts.)
“Rep. Balint does not and will never take corporate PAC money into her own campaign account. Period,” Pollock said in a statement.
July’s FEC filings show that about two-thirds of the money Balint’s campaign brought in over the first half of the year came from individuals. Much of the rest came from PACs representing different industries, labor interests or cooperatives — including one, notably, that featured in the contentious final stages of Balint’s 2022 primary race against Molly Gray. Balint beat Gray and was later elected to her first term.
At the time, Balint’s campaign skewered Gray over a donation Gray received from a PAC tied to American Crystal Sugar Company, which is the country’s largest producer of beet sugar. Balint’s campaign charged that the Minnesota-based cooperative was the “number one donor to GOP congresspeople who willfully encouraged and supported the insurrection on Jan. 6th.” Later that year, a report from the nonpartisan watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington found that American Crystal Sugar’s PAC ranked among the top campaign contributors to members of Congress who voted against the certification of the 2020 presidential election.
Balint was also caught up in controversy following the 2022 primary after campaign filings revealed that Nishad Singh, then a top advisor to the now-disgraced cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman-Fried, had donated $1.1 million to a PAC that then used Singh’s money to buy pro-Balint advertisements. Balint’s campaign later said it had no coordination with Singh during that process.
This April, Balint’s campaign took a $5,000 donation from American Crystal Sugar’s PAC, FEC filings show. (In both the 2022 and 2024 election cycles, the PAC donated more to Democrats than to Republicans, according to an OpenSecrets analysis.)
Asked for comment about that contribution, Pollock said only that Balint “accepts donations from agriculture associations who support her progressive agenda.”
“She’s looking ahead toward taking back the House,” Pollock said.

Bailey was appointed attorney general in 2022 after Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate. Schmitt got the job in 2018 after Josh Hawley resigned to join the Senate. He announced his decision to leave the attorney general’s office Monday evening.
“My life has been defined by a call to service, and I am once again answering that call, this time at the national level,” Bailey said in a news release announcing his departure. “But wherever I am called, Missouri is and always will be home,”
Bailey’s last day as attorney general will be Sept. 8. Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe will name his replacement, who will then serve until the current term expires in 2028. 
Bailey had never run for public office before former Missouri Gov. Mike Parson tapped him to replace Schmitt in 2022. At the time, he was serving as Parson’s general counsel. He previously worked as an assistant prosecuting attorney in Warren County and as an assistant attorney general. 
Andrew Bailey says his approach as Missouri Attorney General is shaped by faith, war

Weeks after being elected to full four-year term last year, Bailey was vying to be President Donald Trump’s new attorney general or FBI director. He will now join the FBI as it faces a torrent of criticism from across the political spectrum over the Trump administration’s refusal to release government files on the late sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. 
His short stint as Missouri’s attorney general was largely defined by confrontation — lawsuits against the federal government, investigations of health care providers and public fights with other statewide elected Republicans.
Bailey’s most high-profile cases since becoming attorney general included twice suing to block federal student loan forgiveness and carrying forward an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging the Biden administration was colluding with social media companies to censor conservative speech.
His office is also involved in four different lawsuits regarding medical records of transgender children — part of his effort to end gender-affirming care in Missouri. 
The attorney general’s office under Bailey helped force St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner out of office and is pursuing felony charges against St. Louis County Executive Sam Page. 
Bailey has also been unflinchingly loyal to Trump, including publicly endorsing the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and unsuccessfully attempting to intervene in the criminal case against him in New York that resulted in 34 felony convictions. 
But Bailey’s tenure as attorney general has also been marked by accusations of corruption, incompetence and grandstanding, with his critics alleging he’s more interested in scoring appearances on Fox News than effectively running the sprawling office or winning in the courtroom.
Among the many lawsuits Bailey inherited from his predecessor was a case against Missouri school districts that implemented mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. After a judge ruled in support of the school boards, Bailey’s office missed its deadline to appeal.
Last summer, he narrowly avoided being questioned under oath about his contact with a defendant in his own case against Jackson County. One of Bailey’s deputies lost his license because of the meetings, according to a filing from the county’s attorneys.
Bailey was also the focus of a formal complaint about the behavior of his office after he falsely blamed the Hazelwood School District’s diversity, equity and inclusion program for the off-campus assault of a student.
He’s also faced criticism over his contributions to his campaign. 
Bailey recused himself from a gambling lawsuit filed against the Missouri State Highway Patrol after PACs connected to the lobbyist of the companies suing the state wrote checks to the committee supporting his campaign.
He raised eyebrows after accepting $50,000 in campaign donations from Doe Run, a St. Louis-based company being sued by thousands of Peruvians over allegations of lead smelter poisoning in their mining town in the Andes. A few months before the donation, Bailey filed a brief asking the federal court to move the lawsuit out of Missouri.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana House Republicans met privately Monday on the north side of Indianapolis to discuss the possibility of redrawing Indiana’s congressional map — but it’s still unclear where the caucus may land on the politically-charged proposal.
House Speaker Todd Huston told the Indiana Capital Chronicle after the roughly two-hour meeting that “we had a good conversation” but did not give details about where the caucus stands, overall.
“We’re still talking, and we’ll work on all this together,” Huston said. 
He said there was no timeline for the caucus to make any decisions and declined to comment on whether a special session seemed likely or not.
While other state lawmakers were mum — with several declining to speak to the Indiana Capital Chronicle following the meeting — members of Indiana’s GOP congressional delegation have jumped on board.
“Democrats have proven they will use every tool available to them to gain and keep power. For years, Republicans have idly stood by while the Left has weaponized government against us,” U.S. Rep. Marlin Stutzman wrote Monday on X. “It’s time for us to drop the gloves. At this moment, our state has the opportunity to give conservative Hoosiers the representation in DC they deserve. I stand with President Trump, it’s time to redraw Indiana’s congressional map!”
Stutzman’s northeastern seat is probably the most isolated from any redistricting threats, though some worry that cracking deep-blue Indianapolis into several districts — rather than packing all the voters into one — could erode the safe margins Republicans currently have in other seats.

— Rep. Marlin Stutzman (@RepStutzman) August 18, 2025

Of Indiana’s nine congressional districts, seven are held by the GOP. Outside of Indianapolis, Democrats hold the northwestern Indiana district. 
U.S. Rep. Victoria Spartz — whose 5th District in central Indiana grew redder in the last map process — also came out in support. She pinned her statement to a post from California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling “to meet fire with fire.”
“This fall, Indiana will have the chance to respond to Democrats’ gerrymandering and stand with President Trump and the state of Texas to stand up for our REPUBLIC! Given developments across the country, I fully support mid-cycle redistricting,” Spartz said. 
And U.S. Rep. Mark Messmer, R-8th, posted this statement: “I am proud to support Hoosier State Legislators and our great @GovBraun in fighting the long history of weaponized voter manipulation in CA, NY, and IL. Redistricting in Indiana will accurately reflect the will of Hoosier voices.”
Messmer was in state Senate leadership when the current congressional map was drawn in 2021 by Indiana Republicans. 
U.S. Rep. Rudy Yakym, R-2nd, posted “Democrats have long used every tool to advance their agenda and hold power. Republicans can’t afford to stay on the sidelines any longer. Indiana now has a chance to ensure conservative Hoosiers are truly represented in Washington. I stand with President Trump — it’s time to redraw our congressional map.
Just after 6 p.m., southern Indiana U.S. Rep. Erin Houchin also publicized her support.
“Democrats will stop at nothing to push their radical agenda. Republicans can’t accept that any longer. Indiana can act to guarantee that all Hoosiers have the strongest possible conservative voices in Washington. I’m standing with President Trump — it’s time to redraw Indiana’s congressional map,” Houchin said.
Pressure on Hoosier Republicans
The push comes after national Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have pressured red states to reconfigure their maps ahead of 2026 to maximize GOP control in the U.S. House. Indiana was launched to the forefront of that conversation following recent meetings between Vice President JD Vance and top state leaders. 
Indiana GOP legislators are headed to the White House next week for a visit that was previously scheduled, but now redistricting will be a topic. 
  Gov. Mike Braun addresses reporters on Aug. 18, 2025. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Gov. Mike Braun reiterated Monday afternoon that he remains noncommittal on whether to call a special session for redistricting, saying the decision will depend on consensus within the General Assembly. 
“I’m not going to call one unless there is going to be general agreement that we need to,” Braun told reporters, noting a session could cost taxpayers roughly $150,000. A special session in Indiana in 2022 cost about $240,000.
Braun acknowledged the national political pressure but emphasized that Indiana is already solidly Republican. 
“Yes, there will be political pressure put on, and it will be cranked up, probably closer you get to the finish line of when they’d like to get it done.”
He added that Republicans “run 88% of the local government offices,” he said. “When southern Indiana, where I’m from, flipped 20 years ago, [it] started into become solidly red congressional districts. It changed, and it’s going to change until something else will flip the other way”.
Still, he left the door open to GOP lawmakers’ demands. 
“We could create nine Republican districts,” Braun said. “But … many things that should evolve (should) not be done out of context”.
Divisions in the caucus
But not all Republicans are on board. 
Rep. Ed Clere, R-New Albany, blasted the idea of an emergency session to redraw congressional lines.
“Under no circumstances will I vote for a new map,” Clere said in a written statement provided to the Capital Chronicle. “Special sessions should be reserved for emergencies. The president’s desperation to maintain a U.S. House majority by stacking the deck in favor of Republicans does not constitute an emergency.”
Clere, speaking before Monday’s caucus, warned that rushing the process without public hearings could open the state to legal challenges and set a dangerous precedent. 
“It would be another step toward a full-time legislature, and that’s the last thing Indiana needs,” he continued. “There is nothing that can’t wait until the next regular session.”
A White House visit and poll amplify redistricting fight in Indiana

He added that redistricting could even backfire on Republicans: “Be careful what you ask for — a new congressional map could have the effect of making some Republican-held congressional districts more competitive.”
Meanwhile, GOP activists have ramped up pressure on lawmakers through telephone calls to Hoosier constituents. 
Longtime Republican Jewell DeBonis told the Capital Chronicle she received multiple automated “robocalls” urging her to contact local legislators, though several initially targeted the wrong representatives. She has since filed a complaint with the attorney general’s office.
“Braun said wait and see what Texas does. I’m offended by that,” DeBonis said. “It shouldn’t matter to us in Indiana what people in Texas or California or Illinois do. We’re better than that. We should stand up for what’s right for Indiana, regardless of what other states are doing. If we go down this path of redistricting every time we get concerned about what the outcomes of the next election might be that’s just perilous. It’s just wrong. … The Republican Party is better than this.”
Josh DeFonce, the communications director for Attorney General Todd Rokita, confirmed that the office had received calls to investigate the legality of Forward America’s robocalls. 
“We rely primarily on complaints to investigate consumer related matters including robocalls,” DeFonce said. “… we now have multiple to review. Only just receiving them today and as you can understand, it will take some time to review those appropriately and fully.”
Conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a co-founder and the executive director of Turning Point USA, also took to social media to threaten Indiana’s GOP incumbents.
“We will support primary opponents for Republicans in the Indiana State Legislature who refuse to support the team and redraw the maps. I’ve heard from grassroots across the country and they want elected Republicans to stand up and fight for them. It’s time for Republicans to be TOUGH Don’t let California steal the 2026 house from us.”

Restoring an 18-acre floodplain at 5 Home Farm Way coupled with the dam removal just downstream could significantly reduce flood risk in the city’s center.

In Montpelier, city officials plan to remove the Pioneer Street Dam and restore a nearby floodplain. Together, the projects are predicted to have compounding positive effects that reduce flood risk in the city.  
The Pioneer Street Dam — an old mill dam — is about 1.3 miles upstream from the capital city’s downtown along the Winooski River. Not only is the dam filled with cracks, but engineers consider it a flood hazard. 
“It’s got about everything wrong with a dam you can imagine,” said Roy Schiff, an engineer who’s monitoring the dam. 
Nearby sits an 18 acre parcel of land at 5 Home Farm Way, where the Stevens Branch of the Winooski River joins the main branch. That land, which houses the Jacob Davis Farmstead, was historically a floodplain. Restoring it to such, coupled with the dam removal just downstream, could significantly reduce flood risk, Schiff said.

The project offers a look at how recovery efforts from the 2023 flood are underway in the city. After years of monitoring water levels and studying the feasibility of the project, officials are starting to seek permitting and funding approval for their plans. 
“There is a real sense of forward momentum and progress,” said Jon Copans, executive director of the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. 
The Vermont River Conservancy first pushed for Montpelier to take down four dams along the river back in 2021. Along with taking down the Pioneer Street Dam, they encouraged dismantling the Bailey Dam, the North Branch Dam and the Hidden Dam. Removing them could mitigate flood risk, improve river ecology and offer recreation opportunities, Randzio said.  
The four old dams hold back a large amount of sediment and a small amount of water, Randzio said. The sediment built up behind their structure pushes water levels even higher during times of peak flow.

The conservancy selected consulting firm SLR International to perform feasibility studies of the four dams in 2021, she said. A grant from The Lake Champlain Basin Program paid for those studies, Randzio said. 
After floods pummeled the state in 2023 — and hit Montpelier especially hard — river experts pointed to thousands of what Schiff calls “deadbeat dams” around the state. Then, city officials and state lawmakers started taking notice. 
In Montpelier, Randzio’s proposals became a high priority. Necessary evaluations of the dams were already underway — putting the project on a fast track, Randzio said. 
The Pioneer Street Dam dates to when people used water to turn wheels or millboards or grind grains, Schiff said. But dams are expensive to maintain and they deteriorate fast, he said. 
Those working on the project anticipate the sediment built up behind the dam contains pollutants from an old coal facility that once operated along the riverbank upstream, Randzio said. Digging out that sediment while breaking down the dam is an iterative process, Schiff said. 
“You have to lower the water a little bit, remove some sediment, lower the dam a little bit,” to prevent sediment from being released downstream, he said.
Just upstream from the dam, at 5 Home Farm Way, sits The Jacob Davis Farmstead, a historic building declared a public safety hazard in 2019, according to The Barre Montpelier Times Argus. The city is currently working with The Preservation Trust of Vermont to remove the building from the property and restore some pieces of it, Copans said. 
That way, the 18 acre property would again be a floodplain. By using that land “we can create more flood storage to help protect the local area and store some more water to protect Montpelier,” Schiff said. 
The city’s also considering ways it can use the land for recreation and public enjoyment, Copans said. 
Schiff’s firm worked with city officials and employees at the regional planning commission to submit a list of projects to request funding from the state. The firm concluded the removal of the Pioneer Dam coupled with the floodplain restoration would offer significant flood mitigation risk compared to other proposed projects, and it made sense to tackle the two projects together. 
The city hopes to get funding from part of FEMA’s hazard mitigation grant program funding offered to Vermont, Copans said. So far, they’ve received positive signals from the state and remain hopeful, he said. 
Then, the project proposals must clear a number of Act 250 and permitting processes before a contractor is hired and work begins, Schiff said. 
But all acknowledge the project is just a piece of the puzzle. Randzio hopes the town can remove all four dams, especially the Bailey Dam by Shaw’s grocery store downtown. 
“Each one of these projects is a step forward and there are more projects sort of in the pipeline,” Copans said.

But the council’s affirmation highlights a growing divide between the City of Wilmington and New Hanover County over government’s role in fostering diversity, equity and inclusion. The conflict is playing out in real time as state and local government officials await a possible veto override of House Bill 171, which targets DEI initiatives in state and local government.
The measure prohibits state agencies and local governments from using state funds to “promote, support, fund, implement, or maintain diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives or programs.” It passed along party lines with Republicans voting for the bill and Democrats against it. Gov. Josh Stein vetoed the legislation but it could face an override attempt.
The legislation came on the heels of President Donald Trump’s executive order terminating diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, positions, and programs in the federal government and equity-related grants and contracts.
Wilmington Council member Kevin Spears said city officials must do what they think is right for the citizens of Wilmington.
“I couldn’t care less about what the federal government at this moment mandates or what the state government at this moment mandates as it relates to how we work to better this community,” he said during a recent council meeting.
However, after a lengthy and spirited discussion last month, the New Hanover Board of County Commissioners voted 3-2 along party lines to withdraw from the partnership on the community relations committee. The three Republicans argued that the committee overstepped its authority by attempting to become a “quasi forum” for fair housing complaints, unfair hiring practices and complaints about other forms of discrimination.

County Manager Chris Coudriet, who recommended ending the county’s participation on the committee, agreed with the three commissioners.
“It should have never been contemplated that the CRAC [Community Relations Advisory Committee] was a clearinghouse for housing complaints,” Coudriet said. “The county had made the decision to eliminate the Human Relations Commission for that very reason.”
In 2009, New Hanover’s commissioners disbanded the county’s Human Relations Commission, which was created decades earlier to assist residents with discrimination complaints regarding racism, sexual harassment or their sexual orientation. Critics of that decision argued that the Human Relations Commission provided ordinary citizens a chance to be heard when complaints regarding discriminatory practices arose.
Similar arguments were made last month in support of the Community Relations Advisory Committee.

“Absent this committee, for the general public, there’s no established platform to be able to come to on a regular basis and bring up issues,” said Commissioner Rob Zapple, one two Democrats who argued in favor of the county continuing to support the Community Relations Advisory Committee.“We pull that away, and we’ve taken a step back 20 or 30 years. I don’t think it’s the best way to serve our citizens.”
 
Concern over civilian review board
For the three Republican commissioners, the larger issue appeared to be the Community Relations Advisory Committee’s past attempt to create a civilian review board for the Sheriff’s Office.

“The sheriff is elected by the people of New Hanover County, that is the civilian review board of the sheriff,” Commissioner Dane Scalise said during a July board meeting. “The sheriff does not need another organization coming in and telling him how to run his office and the fact that that came about is an indication that the committee has misplaced its priorities.”
Commissioner LeAnn Pierce, the board’s vice-chair, was equally blunt in her remarks about the nearly decades-old civilian review board discussion.

“The committees that we appoint citizens to, they work at the pleasure of the county commissioners and if we feel like they have gotten off track, this is where it lands,” Pierce said.
Zapple noted that the committee’s debate over a civilian review board happened long ago.
“We took a look at it and our sheriff weighed in on it and we said ‘No, we don’t think this is a great idea,’” he said. “To use that as justification here in 2025 to disband it [the Community Relations Advisory Committe] was not fair, it wasn’t right.”
Coudriet acknowledged that the the civilian review board discussion wasn’t the work of the current Community Relations Advisory Committee.
“That is not recent discourse but is very prominent discourse in the nature of that body,” Coudriet said.
  Antrevonn Tate (Photo submitted)
Antrevonn Tate, chairman of the committee, said a civilian review board does not reflect the mindset of current committee members. The city appointee said it’s unfair to hold current committee members responsible for actions of past boards.
“If someone had talked to me, we could have sat down and explained to them where we are today,” Tate said. “We are not where we were back in 2016. We’re actually shifting and aligning a lot more with what our bylaws are today and that’s really focused on prejudice and discrimination.”
Pushing race relation efforts out of the county
Tate said the committee’s mission is clear.
“CRAC [Community Relations Advisory Community] wasn’t formed to legislate. It wasn’t formed to force anything, any policy or action from a local perspective. It was really more so to advise our elected body and governing officials.”
Tate acknowledged the committee will feel the loss of county appointees, some of who are employed by New Hanover County and brought invaluable insight to the committee
“These are people that are with the county, so they have good perspectives,”  Tate said. “They’re in the health field, so they’re professionals in the health field, they have their doctorates and a lot of these people have master’s [degrees].”
Republican commissioners didn’t push DEI to the forefront of arguments against ending county participation on the Community Relations Advisory Committee. Their critics, however, said the commissioners goal to rid the county of such initiatives has been undeniable.
“I think without a doubt, it seems like anything that dealt with race relations in a community or in an official capacity, is getting a spotlight put on it,” Zapple said. “It either being changed or eliminated.”
The views of at least one member on the subject are well known.
In January, Scalise railed against a request by the New Hanover County Commission on African American History, Heritage and Culture to adopt a National Day of Racial Healing.
Scalise criticized the county’s Office of Diversity for bringing the proclamation to commissioners.
“The County’s Office of Diversity or DEI department has amply demonstrated that it should not be funded in this year’s or future budgets,” Scalise said in a prepared text he later posted on X. “It is time, as President Donald Trump correctly noted during his inaugural address yesterday (Jan. 20), to ‘end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.’ I will work tirelessly to make that a reality at the local level during our coming budget discussions.”
Commissioners approved the proclamation on a 4-1 vote, with Scalise voting against it.
But the county’s Office of Diversity disappeared and a new Office of Civic Engagement took its place. That office’s stated mission is to “promote an engaged, fair and equal environment that fosters a strong community and culture where residents and employees are respected, valued, and contribute to the county’s success.”
“Commissioner Scalise and the other two Republican Commissioners could not deny the good work that was coming from that office,” Zapple said. “I think what they objected to was the name of the office.”
The office did lose three of its five member staff because of deep county budget cuts, Zapple said.
Meanwhile, at City Hall, the council discussed whether to continue the Community Relations Advisory Committee without county participation.
HB 171 does not prohibit local governments from establishing DEI programs Wilmington City Attorney Meredith Everhart, said. But she warned the council that state lawmakers hold the “purse strings.”
“And what they say [state lawmakers] is that the city has to make a report to the state auditor every year [stating] that we do not engage in any DEI programs and the [state] auditor is supposed to check in on those things and if the auditor reports back [that we’re engaged in DEI programs], we could lose state funding,” Everhart said.
Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo said the Community Relations Advisory Committee has been invaluable in helping Wilmington through civil strife and could continue to play an important role helping to “break through some of the silos” that prevent people from coming together to discuss issues that threaten to disrupt the community.
“I think it can play an important role if it’s properly structured and it’s something that we think could help,” Saffo said.
Saffo said the city understands the risks that come with HB 171.
“We understand the consequences of what’s being held over our heads,” Saffo said. “We get that.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wilmington-Riverwalk-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 22:22:22+00:00,CT Mirror,Emails: Lamont sought counsel as HB 5002 housing bill opposition erupted,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-lamont-hb-5002-169strong-emails/,"CT Gov. Ned Lamont involved his wife, a former state senator and others in discussions over how to respond to opposition to HB 5002.","In the weeks leading up to the veto of the most significant piece of housing legislation to ever cross Gov. Ned Lamont’s desk, he, his wife and key members of his staff calculated the public perception and politics related to whether he would sign the bill, according to internal emails obtained by The Connecticut Mirror.
Less than a month before his decision to veto House Bill 5002, the governor debated how to combat the rhetoric of CT169Strong, a group strongly opposed to the legislation. He called their assertions “gross misrepresentations” of the housing bill, as he considered running for a third term.
“Here’s an example of the anti housing literature, which is catching fire in Fairfield County,” Ned Lamont wrote in a May 31 email seeking the advice of a former Connecticut politician. “I’m trying to figure out how best to respond to these gross misrepresentations before it is too late.”
The literature he was referring to was a lengthy email detailing 169Strong’s concerns about the bill and an explanation of their interpretation of the measure. Lawmakers and housing experts who worked on the bill have repeatedly said the group’s messaging misinterprets the bill and classified it as misinformation.
A CT Mirror review of more than 14,000 pages of communications sent to and from the governor and key members of his staff showed that, in the weeks that followed, the Democratic governor received thousands of emails from people opposed to the housing bill, many featuring identical or similar language.
The governor’s office was particularly interested in gauging the temperature of voters as the bill came to his desk, emails show, asking staffers to tally the number of people in favor and against. They reported that much of the opposition came from Fairfield County residents who appeared not to have read the actual bill.
Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s communications director, said in a statement Monday that the governor wanted to “ensure that all views were being expressed and shared on the housing bill, rather than one group controlling the conversation.” 
We won’t be sidetracked by some small group of housing extremists who are probably more worried about where they’ll be ‘summering’ this season than they are about someone else’s plight to find housing.Statement from democratic senators
“The Governor ultimately did not sign the housing bill into law because of concerns he had around whether local leaders would be able to achieve the goals outlined in the bill— no current or future politics played a role in his decision,” Blanchard said. He added that Lamont has been working to add more state resources to housing construction and is committed to working on an improved housing bill.
“One thing we have learned from that work is that local leaders need to be bought in to the solution — and it was clear that was not the case with this bill,” he said in the statement. “Additionally, rhetoric that spreads misinformation or villainizes efforts to fix our housing can also make that mission harder.”
House Bill 5002 was a sweeping piece of housing legislation that addressed issues from parking to zoning and homelessness. It aimed to increase the state’s housing supply as Connecticut faces a dire lack of homes, particularly those that are affordable to its lowest-income residents. A report released earlier this year from the state’s largest business association also showed that the lack of housing is holding back Connecticut’s economy.
The bill was years in the making and was a priority for House and Senate Democrats. Lamont’s staff helped negotiate it, and lawmakers passed it with assurances that the governor would sign.
But it faced fierce opposition from Republicans and groups that represent towns. CT169Strong, which operates largely out of Fairfield County and has opposed state-level changes to zoning policy, also launched a campaign to get Lamont to veto the bill.
“People are recognizing that if they want to find out what’s in the bills, they come to us as a source for that information when their legislators are not necessarily doing that,” said Maria Weingarten, one of the 169Strong co-founders, in an interview Monday.
On June 23, Lamont vetoed the bill, saying he wanted lawmakers to try again and that he thought he could get towns on board with a new bill to be addressed in a special session.
He said he particularly wanted to work on a provision in the bill that would have banned off-street parking minimums for smaller housing developments and a measure that assigned each town a number of units of housing to plan and zone for.
“I think we can make it better,” Lamont said when he vetoed the bill. “I think the only way to really make it work is if you have buy-in from the local communities. And I think the vast majority of those communities want to do the right thing.”
In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London, and Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, said it’s unfortunate the original bill was vetoed, but they are working with Lamont on a new housing bill.
“Meanwhile, we won’t be sidetracked by some small group of housing extremists who are probably more worried about where they’ll be ‘summering’ this season than they are about someone else’s plight to find housing that is affordable, or a business owner’s plight to find employees who can actually afford to buy a home in Connecticut,” the statement said.
Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe expressed concern about 169Strong’s influence in the process.
“I think it’s just a little concerning that 169Strong has such a hold on folks’ opinions when there were plenty of us within the legislature that worked closely with the governor’s office, and the governor himself, that had different opinions,” said Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “It felt like this group, as large as they are, had more sway in the moment, or had more say on our policy than us as policymakers.”
Framing the message
Internal emails from the start of the session until the day of the veto show very little discussion of the policies in the bill. Lamont’s office raised a few technical concerns in the spring but appeared to be on board by the time the bill was signed, although the governor and Annie Lamont, his wife, raised concerns early on about public perception.
On May 29, the day before the Senate gave final passage to H.B. 5002, Annie Lamont received an email containing a message from 169Strong outlining their opposition to the bill. She sent it along to the governor. 
“Let’s get a response to this so I can send back,” Ned Lamont responded, forwarding the message to his spokesman, Blanchard. “I don’t think we have an equivalent of 169 strong.”
The Senate gave final passage to H.B. 5002 on May 30. On May 31, Lamont emailed former Sen. Will Haskell, D-Wilton, to ask his advice on controlling the “anti housing” messaging from 169Strong.
The group, which is registered as a corporation and takes donations, formed five years ago. 
Haskell told the governor the best way to tamp down the opposition was to sign the bill. He suggested framing the law as both a “moral and economic imperative” and gave the governor specific suggestions on how to announce the bill signing, including an example of a social media video to mimic to promote the effort.
“This bill isn’t about changing our towns, but rather ensuring a few more people can enjoy what makes this state special,” Haskell said in the email. He also spoke about what he considered 169Strong’s weaknesses.
“I would sign the bill loudly, go on offense, and attempt to put the CT169Strong crowd on their heels. I know Maria (who wrote that 169 email), and she doesn’t do well when forced to reckon with big-picture policy questions,” he said, referring to Weingarten, one of the founders of the group.
Haskell declined to comment on Monday.
Weingarten said Monday she wasn’t bothered by Haskell’s email but more focused on ensuring that the policymaking process is transparent. The omnibus bill started as a study, and during the legislative process, several bills were added together to create H.B. 5002. They got public hearings earlier in the process under different names.
That’s typically the process for Connecticut’s legislature, but Republicans have criticized it, saying it’s misleading.
“Listening to the governor’s comments, it still wasn’t clear to us that he had fully grasped what was in the bill,” Weingarten said. “We stand by everything we’ve said about what’s in the bill, and we encourage everybody to continue to understand and look at the details of what’s in the bill and the potential implications.”
Haskell’s idea didn’t stick with the governor’s office. 
Blanchard said Lamont regularly consults with allies and colleagues on policy matters.
“This bill was no different,” he wrote. “The Governor heard from and met with many who requested he sign the bill and others who asked that he not. He appreciated hearing different viewpoints and strategies and will ultimately incorporate some of them into a new housing bill.”
The governor and first lady heard from fellow Greenwich residents about the reasons Lamont shouldn’t sign the bill.
A Greenwich resident on June 4 emailed Annie Lamont asking what she thought about a 169Strong message. Annie forwarded the message to Ned.
“We need to get our talking points out there !!!” she said.
That wasn’t the only time the Lamonts heard from someone who knew them. On June 5, a Wilton resident the governor met at a boat show emailed him.
“I find HB 5002 an extreme government overreach of the state to towns and cities. I am frankly shocked that this bill passed with bi-partisan opposition,” the resident wrote, referencing the Democrats and Republicans who voted against the bill.
Annie Lamont intervened directly with Blanchard on June 4, forwarding him the 169Strong email. 
“It must be going all over the state and we have no response. Lots of people commenting. Concerted effort on R’s [Republicans’] part to say ned raised taxes and destroyed the guard rails,” she wrote. “They are gearing up fir a compaign. We need to provide a bullet point by BP [bullet point] response.”
The governor’s staff emailed about a few questions about the policy but ultimately agreed with the measures.
“I think policy-wise we are fine with most of the list, but there are fiscal notes on many pieces that we’ll have to oppose/ will be negotiated in the budget pieces,” said Megan Krementowski, a legislative director at the governor’s office, in an April 29 email.
Patrick Hulin, Lamont’s policy director, emailed in mid-May requesting smaller changes to the bill and thanking lawmakers “for engaging us so thoroughly in this process.”
Voices of voters
In the weeks leading up to the veto, the governor’s office got thousands of emails and calls from residents about H.B. 5002. Most of them, especially early on, implored the governor to veto the bill.
The opposition to the housing bill organized early and pushed what political pundits say was a last-ditch attempt to ensure it didn’t become law. Meanwhile, supporters thought Lamont planned to sign the bill and didn’t organize until later when it became clear the governor was wavering.
“We had every indication that the governor was on board with the bill as it passed the House and Senate,” said Erin Boggs, executive director of the Open Communities Alliance, which advocated for the bill. “So there was no reason to mount the campaign to ensure the Governor did not veto it, particularly because his staff was deeply involved in developing it.”
Blanchard asked staff answering the phones for daily counts of the numbers in favor or against the bill.
While the numbers fluctuated, the majority were in opposition, according to the reports. The majority were also from a few towns in Fairfield County — New Canaan, Greenwich, Fairfield, Darien and Westport were named specifically. 
“Many callers mention preserving the ‘culture’ of their town as a big reason they oppose the bill,” wrote one of the governor’s staff members in an email to Blanchard. “We have had some supporters, but not many likely less than 50 in total. It seems many of the callers are using information they are getting from the CT169 organization.”
Staff answering the phones also noted that most of those callers didn’t appear to have read the bill. “Many callers are relying upon mailers from special interest organizations as their sole source of information,” the June 23 email to Blanchard read.
Many of the opposition emails also appeared to be form messaging, using much of the same language. The Senate Republicans posted suggested language asking for a veto online, and 169Strong’s emails included a button that could send an email to Lamont’s office with just a couple of clicks.
“I most politely urge you to veto HB 5002, a sweeping bill that threatens local control, environmental protections, and public participation in land use decisions across Connecticut,” one common email began.
Many environmental advocates were in favor of H.B. 5002. On June 11, an official with the CT Roundtable on Climate and Jobs asked Blanchard whether Lamont would be interested in participating in a celebration and public signing of the environmental wins during the session, and listed 5002 as one of those.
That celebration didn’t occur as proposed.
Emails in favor, while fewer in number, differed more from one another.
“I understand that concerns have been raised, particularly from Fairfield County,” wrote Eliza Massaro, chair of the Avon Democratic Town Committee. “But as you know, Fairfield is just one of [the] … counties in Connecticut. While their voices matter, we cannot allow the perspective of a single region to dictate the direction of a statewide solution.”
Blanchard said Monday that the staff carefully reviewed all messages that came into the office about the bill. 
“While there were hundreds of calls or emails, some simply opposed the bill through generic form letters, while others may have been opposed but provided detailed thoughtful legislative feedback, in addition to those who were supportive,” he said.
Planning and Development Committee co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, said in a Monday interview that she spoke with the governor ahead of the veto about what she viewed as the outsized influence of Fairfield County on the rest of the state.
“While I understand the importance of Fairfield County, that is not our only place that needs housing, and make no mistake, they need housing too,” Kavros DeGraw said. “So I think it was accurate to say that they [169Strong] were grossly misrepresenting what was in the bill … They were unfortunately legitimized by the veto.
“We often hear that a city or a town doesn’t want Hartford making decisions for them. Well, it sounds like we had a handful of towns making decisions for the entire state. That’s not fair or acceptable either,” she said.
When Lamont vetoed the bill on June 23, Blanchard gathered a list of news coverage and responses to the decision, including some from angry and disappointed lawmakers and housing advocates. Lamont forwarded the message to his wife.
“On plane to Nashville.. thanks for sharing this.. know it’s not going to be as fun.. but what third term is.. and world getting more angry and divided not less,” she responded.
Some advocates and lawmakers said the emails show Lamont thinks more people oppose the bill than actually do. Kavros DeGraw, who represents a district that has been represented by Democrats and Republicans and who has been a leader on housing policy for years, said many voters want to see better housing policy.
Last session, in a race largely centered on housing and zoning policy, one of the 169Strong co-founders, Alexis Harrison, lost a House race against incumbent Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, by a landslide. That race, among others, has led pundits to question whether Connecticut voters are really as opposed to housing development as traditionally believed.
“I actually think we had greater consensus than ever before that there is an important housing crisis we need to deal with,” Boggs said. “And proposals in House Bill 5002 were a major step in the right direction. So while it’s true that disinformation can accentuate the divides that exist, I think they were actually hearing from a smaller group of folks who oppose this bill.”
Lawmakers said they were looking forward and continuing to negotiate with Lamont on an adjusted version of the bill.
“My hope is that we are still moving in a productive direction for the state of Connecticut on housing and ensuring that the people who want to live here are able to stay here in an affordable way, and that people who are looking to move here are also able to find a home here,” Kavros DeGraw said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lamont-Veto-0623-DE-014-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

(Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State leaders continued to stand firm against federal demands for personal data of Kansans who have received food assistance, even after a letter last week threatened funding losses. 
Kansas Department for Children and Families secretary Laura Howard laid out objections to turning over the data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program applicants and users in a Monday news release. The data includes Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses and more.
“The USDA’s data request is for the purpose of creating a federal database of SNAP participant information that may be disclosed to other entities, and it is unclear whether those entities are legally allowed to access that information,” the release said. 
Collecting the extensive dataset, which is more than has been required in the past from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, may cost as much as $100,000, the release said. In addition, the current secure way DCF transfers data to the federal government is not set up to handle that amount of information. 
Howard said state finances would be affected by the data collection process. 
“We also believe this request places a significant burden on DCF and state resources, and it’s not something that can be accommodated on a short deadline,” Howard said. “Providing this magnitude of data could take months and come with a hefty price tag.”
Gov. Laura Kelly joined a lawsuit with other states challenging whether the data should be turned over, and the press release said it would be appropriate to wait until the lawsuit was decided before sending any information. 
Previously, USDA secretary Brooke Rollins said her agency would hold off on requesting the data until the lawsuit was decided.  
Beginning in May, DCF refused the USDA’s requests for personal data of SNAP users. 
The USDA escalated its push for the information in the letter last week, demanding Kansas officials make “adequate progress towards meeting the data collection requirements,” setting an Aug. 15 deadline to submit a plan to do so.  
The letter also said refusing to comply would put SNAP administrative funding at issue. 
Kansas leaders stood firm, even as Republicans have lambasted Kelly and Howard for failing to share the information. 
Rep. Dan Hawkins, R-Wichita, challenged Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach last week at the Legislative Coordinating Council meeting to find whether Kelly has the right to withhold the data. He also repeated misinformation that the error rate in the SNAP program is 12%. The most recent error rate is 9.98%, according to the USDA. \
The error rate refers to the percentage of errors found in SNAP applications and is calculated annually. 
Kobach told Hawkins he has a team of attorneys investigating that question, and he added that providing information is a requirement for receiving the federal money. 
“We certainly know that the federal government has the ability at this stage, if the governor continues to refuse to provide the information, to deny the funds, and I understand that that’s a very substantial amount of money we’re talking about,” Kobach said. “She is putting at risk the receipt of Kansas of those monies, which I guess is sort of ironic, and probably why you asked the question, because that is a very substantial amount of money.”
In 2024, Kansas SNAP recipients received $408 million in benefits.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Laura-Howard-5-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

The official ICE account reposted it.,"The timing and reach of a social media posts accusing a Connecticut state lawmaker of impeding federal immigration agents are drawing the FBI, state police and Capitol police to assess the threat posed by the resulting deluge of abuse.
It is the latest and highest-profile example of what House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford says is is an all-too-common drill: divining the differences between political speech, harassment and credible criminal threats.
“That line can be very small and thin at times,” said Ritter, who estimates that half of all lawmakers will need threat assessments in any given two-year term. “We have a protocol in place.”
The shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers on June 14 had lawmakers on edge long before “@LibsofTikTok,” a right-wing poster with 4.3 million followers on X, urged federal charges against Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.
Three days ago, it accused him of divulging, in an Instagram post, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents’ “live location and warning illegals to stay ‘vigilant.’ He’s helping illegals evade arrest and impeding ICE. Charge him.”

It was reposted a day later by the official ICE account, tagging the Justice Department account. That was enough for “@LibsofTikTok” to proclaim Sunday that ICE had referred Paris for prosecution.
Paris did not identify any locations where Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were gathered, instead sharing unverified reports that ICE agents were active in his House district.
“While we are still working to verify the full scope of these reports, I urge all residents to remain vigilant, stay aware of your surroundings, and, above all, prioritize your safety,” Paris wrote in his post.
The @LibsofTikTok critique was viewed 970,000 times, a number amplified by other reposts. The reaction over the weekend was furious and abusive, much of it racist, friends said.
Paris is Black.
“I think the dehumanization of public officials is horrifying — and coming out of what happened in Minnesota is particularly concerning,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford.
Candelora returned Monday morning on a red-eye flight from Los Angeles, where he was attending a small bipartisan legislative conference. One of the attendees was a friend of Melissa Hortman, the Democratic legislative leader killed in Minnesota. Her husband also was killed, and a second lawmaker and his wife were shot and wounded in a separate attack the same night.
“Her life is changed forever. I’ve gone to several conferences with her,” Candelora said. “People forget that public officials are human beings.”
Whether anyone disagreed with Paris does not justify abuse and harassment, he said.
Candelora said even before the incident with Paris that state legislators in Connecticut were removing legislative plates from their motor vehicles because they feared being identified.
One anonymous caller to Paris’ cell phone said his life and family connections were known and being distributed widely, a chilling claim, said other lawmakers.
The call was recorded by Paris’s fiancée. They were together in his car when his phone range, and she answered. She used her phone to record it. A copy was provided to the Connecticut Mirror.
“You’re messing with someone that was a subcontractor for the NSA, you stupid [expletive] idiot,” the caller said. “This content is being replicated and duplicated all across Christian networks, all across Trump supporters, MAGA supporters and right wing newspapers.”
ICE did not respond to a request for comment.
Christine Bartlett-Josie, a political consultant and family friend of Paris, said the FBI has a copy of the recorded call and is investigating, as are the Capitol and state police.
“It is unfortunate and alarming to be wrongfully targeted by a federal agency and even called for arrest by the DOJ,” Paris said in a statement released by the legislature’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus. “However, my commitment to compassion, courage, and community — and my refusal to be silenced when the safety of my neighbors is at stake — will never be shaken.”
Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said angry calls and emails come with the job, but what Paris is experiencing is of another scale — as is the role of a federal law enforcement agency in fueling the abuse.
“The federal government should be a place that you go to protect yourself when you’re facing these attacks, not a place that amplifies them and calls people against you,” he said.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, a Black and Puerto Rican Caucus member who is accustomed to online abuse as the co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over hot-button issues such as gun control, said it has become unwise to dismiss harassment as merely offensive words.
Winfield spent time with Paris, reviewing the threats.
“Some of these folks seem unhinged,” Winfield said. “It’s been a crazy day and a half.”
Like the anonymous caller, many made clear they know where to find Paris and people in his immediate circle. 
“There may not be a direct threat, but there is an implied threat,” Winfield said.
Candelora, the Republican leader, agreed.
“That is the danger of social media. It brings everyone into your living room,” he said. “You don’t know.”
Candelora said the accused shooter in Minnesota did not have any direct contact with his victim.
“It was random,” he said. “It was evil.”

(Photo by Gage Skidmore)Toward the end of a four-hour hearing in central Pennsylvania on Friday, the judge overseeing a challenge to the constitutionality of Alina Habba’s appointment as acting U.S. attorney made a comment that will cause New Jersey Democrats’ hearts to sink.
“I think it’s very likely that Ms. Habba is going to end up, at some point down the road, as the United States attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Judge Matthew Brann said.
I don’t think Brann was signaling how he plans to rule on this matter later this week, because he noted that he has no “crystal ball.” I think what he may have intended to communicate to both sides in the matter is how this saga will likely end if it lands in the U.S. Supreme Court’s lap.
Let’s back up a bit for the uninitiated.
President Donald Trump named Alina Habba, a personal attorney who represented Trump in a civil defamation case, as New Jersey’s chief federal prosecutor back in March. That’s a role that requires confirmation from the U.S. Senate, but Trump didn’t nominate her until the tail end of her 120-day term as acting U.S. attorney. When her term was drawing to a close and there was no movement on her nomination — our two U.S. senators, both Democrats, object to Habba, and her confirmation is unlikely without their approval — New Jersey’s district judges were tasked with naming a more permanent replacement. They chose Habba’s second in command, Desiree Grace.
The Trump administration then fired Grace, Habba resigned as U.S. attorney, and the administration gave Habba the No. 2 job in the office. Because the U.S. attorney spot was now vacant, Habba automatically assumed the role of acting U.S. attorney again, this time for 210 more days, the Trump administration says. Two men facing federal criminal charges then challenged Habba’s appointment as unconstitutional, leading to Friday’s hearing in Pennsylvania (the matter was handed to Brann because New Jersey’s district judges had conflicts).
I went into Friday’s hearing with a significant bias against Habba. I’ve written before about my distaste for her swooning over an alleged sex trafficker in January. I think her stated goal to help New Jersey Republicans get elected is disqualifying. And the zeal with which she tossed Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) behind bars — on a charge so flimsy she had to retreat just days later — was obscene.
Nothing about the hearing changed my mind on whether Habba is fit to serve as U.S. attorney. But the arguments persuaded me the law is murky enough that the fight to prevent her from staying in office will fail.
There’s no smoking gun here, despite the valiant efforts on both sides to argue their case to Brann. Yes, the Trump administration’s maneuvering was an obvious end run around the U.S. Senate confirmation process — but the administration’s reliance on the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which allows first assistants in various government agencies to be the default acting No. 1, is convincing. And the challengers’ response is less so. They argue that the statute is automatic, triggered by a vacancy — meaning the U.S. attorney spot was vacant when Habba resigned, and so she can’t resume that position by later taking the No. 2 spot.
“What happened here was the president or the executive, they terminated the first assistant in order to backfill the role, and Ms. Habba then created the resignation — well, she resigned, created the vacancy to fill it herself. It’s circular. I mean, it doesn’t make any sense. And it goes completely against what the statute is meant to protect,” said attorney Thomas Mirigliano, who is representing a man seeking to nullify Habba’s appointment.
Henry C. Whitaker, representing the Trump administration, countered that the vacancy in the U.S. attorney post existed not just at the moment Habba resigned — it also existed when she subsequently accepted the No. 2 post that allows her to become acting U.S. attorney for a new, 210-day term.
“The vacancy is a continuing condition,” Whitaker said.
Like I said, Brann gave no hint how he might rule on this — though he wisely conceded that he will not be the final word and said Habba and the New Jersey judges who tried to replace her may have to find a way to coexist. The judges, Brann noted, are appointed for life and are not likely to resign.
“They’re going to have to find a way to maneuver things together after this immediate issue, which is quite interesting, is resolved,” Brann said.
Brann is smart enough to realize that this matter may only be resolved by the nation’s highest court. The Roberts court has embraced the power of the executive, most recently in its June 27 decision limiting the power of federal judges to institute universal injunctions. Do we think the same justices, faced with a controversy over who gets to pick the U.S. attorney of New Jersey, will side with our state’s federal judges over Donald Trump?
If the Trump administration wins here, it may be a short-lived victory. Its own arguments on Habba hinge on her current appointment lasting for 210 days. That means her term has an expiration date of mid-February 2026, giving the administration plenty of time to find someone who has the qualifications to win confirmation from the U.S. Senate. Or enough time to think of a new legal strategy to keep her in the post no matter what.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa Department of Corrections)A state corrections officer fired for misconduct has been awarded jobless benefits, with a judge finding the state’s own evidence failed to back up its claims of wrongdoing.
Samantha Holub worked for the Iowa Department of Corrections at the Anamosa State Penitentiary from November 2023 through February 2025, when she was placed on administrative leave. She was fired on April 2, 2025 for allegedly violating rules related to employee conduct.
According to the DOC, a review of security-camera footage indicated that in early February, Holub took a Ziploc bag out of her pocket, removed a pill, and then gave the pill to an inmate. The DOC allegedly discovered another incident that occurred at around the same time that involved Holub giving a handwritten note to an inmate while they were in the infirmary.

The department also alleged Holub had been using the workplace Google Chat software to communicate with co-workers at non-work email addresses — a potential security violation.
According to state records, DOC investigator Michael Griffith interviewed Holub, who allegedly explained the incident with the pill by stating that nurses withheld ibuprofen from inmates who visited the infirmary since it was hoped the inmates would instead purchase the drug through the commissary.
Holub allegedly explained that it can take days for the commissary-ordered medications to arrive after they’re ordered, leaving the individuals in pain – and so, after seeing a nurse refuse one inmate’s request for ibuprofen, she gave the inmate the drug.
As for the note passing, Holub explained she had talked to an inmate who was interested in applying for a part-time job in the infirmary and had written down for the inmate the names and job titles of administrators who handled such applications.
Holub admitted using Google Chat to communicate with others through non-work email addresses, but indicated she was unaware that was not allowed.
Recently, Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson presided over a hearing on Holub’s request for unemployment benefits, which the DOC had challenged.
At the hearing, the DOC chose not to offer any witness statements, any video evidence, or any records to support its decision to discharge Holub, Johnson noted. “The employer’s own testimony also failed to support its stated reasons for discharging (Holub),” Johnson said in her ruling, adding that Holub’s explanations for her conduct were credible.
Johnson also pointed out that while the DOC claimed Holub’s use of Google Chat had violated security protocol, that claim was “undermined by a supervisor” who had initiated one of the conversations the department was citing as evidence of wrongdoing.
“Out of the alleged 324 pages of messages in the employer’s possession, it did not submit a single message as evidence for the hearing,” Johnson stated in her ruling. “The evidence in the record does not establish the employer discharged (Holub) for disqualifying, job-related misconduct. It may have complied with its internal policies in ending her employment, and this decision does not question the soundness of the employer’s business decision.”

(Courtesy photo)Citing violations of state law and other concerns, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Monday filed a petition with the New Mexico Supreme Court to consider removal of Eleventh Judicial District Attorney Bernadine Martin in McKinley County.
The move, according to a New Mexico Department of Justice news release, follows a request from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and a “detailed investigation” by the agency.
The petition’s findings include: a hostile workplace environment; failure to prepare or subpoena witnesses in McKinley County; violations of procurement law, despite a prior settlement with the State Ethics Commission; “improper reliance” on contract attorneys; and Martin’s alleged continued work in private legal practice while serving as district attorney, in violation of state law.
A voicemail and email to Martin was not returned prior to publication.
Martin was elected to her second four-year term in November of 2024. According to the petition, at least 48 employees in the Eleventh Judicial District Attorney’s office either resigned or have been terminated during Martin’s tenure. The investigation on workplace issues was based on 14 interviews, including with Martin, the petition says.
“Nearly every person interviewed during NMDOJ’s investigation reported [Martin’s] office to be a hostile work environment,” the petition says, with two “seasoned investigator” saying they resigned due to her “yelling, screaming, and belittling behavior.” The petition notes that Martin said “she never raised her voice or yelled at any of her employees.”
The petition also alleges Martin “consistently fails to properly prepare or subpoena witnesses for court proceedings in a timely
fashion,” and cited Gallup Police Chief Erin Toadlena-Pablo who said Martin didn’t meet with officers prior to court, unlike her predecessors. McKinley County Sheriff James Maiorano confirmed to investigators “that subpoenas were being faxed to the sheriff’s office the same day cases were scheduled for hearings. When officers didn’t appear, [Martin] blamed the sheriff’s office for dismissing the cases.”
According to the petition, Martin’s office does not have any assistant district attorneys, but instead relies on contract lawyers for felony prosecution and DWIs. Moreover, the petition claims those lawyers are being used in ways that also may violate state law, including for conflicts of interest as one of the contract lawyers maintains a private practice that has both civil and criminal cases.
Martin herself retains a private practice, the petition says, a violation of state law.
“This is an extraordinary step, but it is necessary to protect the integrity of the justice system,” Torrez said in a statement. “The people of McKinley County deserve a district attorney who can fulfill the responsibilities of the office. It is now up to the Supreme Court to review the evidence and determine whether Ms. Martin should remain in that role.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bmartin-1024x1024.png,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

 A VTDigger investigation found that UPS workers in Vermont had their paid time off taken without their consent. The issue has drawn attention from an international union and potential action from the attorney general. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont workers allege UPS violated family leave law.","Workers at two United Parcel Service package centers in Vermont are accusing their employer of violating state family and medical leave laws by using their paid time off without their knowledge or consent.
UPS workers at package centers in Brattleboro and Wilder shared documents with VTDigger showing that their previously approved unpaid family and medical leave had been switched with their paid time off. In making the switch, the UPS locations effectively reduced the amount of paid days workers can take off.
The federal Family and Medical Leave Act, passed in 1993, entitles workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a one-year period for certain family or medical needs. Vermont law has continually expanded those rights since the 1990s, including giving workers up to four hours of unpaid short-term leave every 30 days for purposes such as taking children to medical appointments or school activities and taking family members to appointments related to their well-being.Vermont law also states that employees can use accrued paid leave, including vacation and personal leave, in lieu of unpaid family and medical leave “at the employee’s discretion.” However, the UPS workers claim management used their paid leave without their permission.This accusation has prompted action from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters — a labor union that represents 1.3 million workers globally — and a potential incoming response by the Vermont attorney general’s office.
A UPS spokesperson told VTDigger in a statement on Friday that the company is “aware of the issue,” and is taking “necessary steps to quickly correct the situation and ensure this is not an issue in the future.”
Issues for package center workers in Wilder began in February, after Driver Supervisor Nick Webster allegedly expressed his frustration over drivers using FMLA during a snowstorm in a way he thought was improper, according to a June 9 complaint filed with the Vermont attorney general’s office.
Webster said that after a meeting with the UPS’s labor department, it was decided that anyone attempting to use FMLA would have that unpaid leave swapped with their paid time off, the complaint alleges. It also says  that a union steward told Webster this would be illegal, but that Webster did not seem to care. 
Webster declined comment for this story, and two UPS labor managers covering the Vermont area did not reply to requests for comment.

Two workers at the Wilder package center who spoke to VTDigger described being confused about how the situation around the FMLA unfolded. Despite the issue being discussed in February, the workers said, it took until late May for them to see their previously approved family and medical leave swapped with paid time off. One worker at the Brattleboro package center also said that the issue began for them in May.
One of the Wilder package center workers, David Kendall, a driver, said that by changing his leave from FMLA to personal and sick days, management left him with fewer days available to spend with his teenage nephew, Jerimiah. Kendall has had full custody of Jerimiah since 2014.Kendall, who has been with UPS for almost a decade, said he enjoys his route that regularly weaves through the backroads of Springfield and Eastman, a journey so rural that when he’s driving he often doesn’t have cellphone service. 
“When I’m out on the road, I’m essentially my own boss. I enjoy the freedom of not having somebody looking over my shoulder every five minutes, like if I was in an office setting,” Kendall told VTDigger. “I enjoy when I’m delivering a parcel to someone and they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh, we were hoping for you to be here on time for so-and-so’s birthday or an important event,’ and they’re like, ‘We weren’t expecting you so soon!’ and have a huge smile on their face.”Kendall said, in interviews with VTDigger, that he first noticed the issue after a previously approved FMLA full-day leave on May 27 was switched to an option day. This is a form of paid time off earned by UPS workers. This switch was made by Webster without Kendall’s knowledge or consent, he said. Since May, Kendall said, he has had six days of paid time off taken without his permission: four of his five sick days and two of his three option days.

“Now I have no sick days. So if I’m sick, I still have to go to work,” he said. “And, they took the option days I would use to spend more time with my nephew … to attend school events that he wanted me to attend, and stuff like that, ’cause he plays basketball for the youth basketball team.”
Kendall said that until May, he had been allowed to use family and medical leave to take Jerimiah to medical appointments. Jerimiah has developmental and cognitive challenges, as well as mental health issues, Kendall said.
“Whenever we took FMLA, it wasn’t an issue,” he said. “I would go into work and I’d work like four, five, six hours, and then I would take the rest of the day off to get him to his appointments.”
Payroll and insurance documents obtained and reviewed by VTDigger show that six of Kendall’s previously approved family and medical leave days were switched with sick and option days by various members of UPS package center management. 
Kendall is not the only worker alleging that their unpaid family and medical leave was switched without their consent. 
Justin Doubleday, an employee at the UPS package center in Brattleboro, said that in one instance this issue led to a workplace confrontation. He  said he took his 10-year-old son to a medical visit using previously approved short-term family leave. When he attempted to return to work at the Brattleboro package center, he said, he found his truck wasn’t loaded. He said he discovered that management had put him in for a sick day.
“I put in for four hours of short term FMLA … instead they put me in for a sick day. They put in the system that I called out sick, even though I gave them a week in advance a short-term family medical leave form and let them know that I would be into work after. … Everybody there, other management included, were like ‘This is fucked up. This isn’t right. You put in for FMLA.’”
Doubleday said he confronted the supervisor who had put in the sick day without Doubleday’s consent. After an argument and pressure from other members of management, the supervisor reversed the decision, Doubleday said. The supervisor gave Doubleday back his sick day and paid him for the 33 minutes he had spent arguing in the facility that day before going home.“This is the shit that they do and that we put up with. Isn’t that ridiculous?” Doubleday said. 
Documents obtained by VTDigger show that one of Doubleday’s previously approved short-term family and medical leave was replaced with an option day. 
UPS did not respond to a request for comment Monday on the specific allegations made by the workers. 
Union action
After learning his paid time off had been used, Kendall said, he alerted the union — Teamsters Local 597, a chapter of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Kendall filed multiple grievances with the union, and union officials communicated the FMLA issue directly with UPS management, according to the June 9 complaint filed with the Vermont attorney general. 
On June 26, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters sent a letter to UPS’s counsel, demanding they “immediately cease and desist from requiring our members in Vermont use their accrued paid leave during FMLA-qualifying leave,” further stating that they were prepared to take legal action if they did not hear from UPS by July 4.
“They’re not just violating the law, they’re violating the collective bargaining agreement. So it’s not just a law enforcement issue, it’s also an issue for the international union,” said Curtis Clough, president of Local 597.The union’s contract with UPS states that the company, “may require the employee to substitute accrued paid vacation or other paid leave,” when a worker is taking FMLA, but that workers are permitted two weeks of paid vacation that cannot be substituted for FMLA. 
However, the contract goes on to say that these provisions, “shall not supersede any state or local law, which provides for greater employee rights,” meaning Vermont’s family leave law supersedes the contract.Clough, who worked his way up from a seasonal helper at UPS to a full-time driver before leaving to take a position at the union, said the paid time theft is an escalation in what has become a fractious relationship between management and workers. The union does not know why UPS has stood so firmly behind what he sees is a clear violation of the law, he said.
“UPS is pretty antagonistic. … UPS routinely harasses drivers, so it’s hard to pick out a reason why,” he said. “There is no longer a culture where the driver supervisors come up through the ranks.”
According to communications obtained by VTDigger, at least one of the attorney general’s senior investigators has reviewed the alleged violations at the package centers. A representative from the attorney general’s office told VTDigger that the office could not comment on what cases they are investigating.

Luna-Perez is accused of killing a woman and her daughter in a drunken driving crash in Lakewood. (Tim Hawk for New Jersey Monitor)TOMS RIVER — The undocumented immigrant accused of driving drunk and killing two people in Lakewood last month, landing himself at the center of a political firestorm because of his immigration status, will remain jailed pending trial.
Raul Luna-Perez, a 43-year-old resident of Red Bank, consented during a brief hearing in front of Superior Court Judge Guy P. Ryan on Monday to remain detained. Luna-Perez is facing multiple counts of aggravated manslaughter, assault by auto, and vehicular homicide.
Attorneys revealed no new details about the case during Monday’s 10-minute hearing.
Luna-Perez was charged July 27 in connection with a crash the day prior that killed Maria Pleitez and her 11-year-old daughter. Police say Luna-Perez was behind the wheel with a blood alcohol content over three times the state’s legal limit when he crossed into oncoming traffic and hit Pleitez’s car head on. 
In an earlier hearing, a different judge ordered him released pending trial on home confinement with an ankle monitor despite arguments from the county prosecutor to keep Luna-Perez detained. Luna-Perez has two prior arrests from earlier this year on drunken driving charges, and was the subject of a 2023 domestic violence complaint that was later withdrawn, according to court documents and court officials.
After his initial release from jail, immigration agents took him into custody and jailed him at an Elizabeth detention center. Ocean County prosecutors then added additional charges, retrieved him from Elizabeth, returned him to the county jail, and asked the court a second time to detain him pending trial.

The White House has highlighted Luna-Perez’s case to criticize New Jersey’s Immigrant Trust Directive, which restricts when local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents, and it has placed the blame for the fatal crash on Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who supports the directive.
Murphy in response has said Luna-Perez “shouldn’t have been on the road, and frankly, he shouldn’t have been in the country.”  
The state Attorney General’s Office has said the directive did not bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration officials to deport Luna-Perez. The directive allows for cooperation regarding undocumented immigrants facing some serious and violent charges, including assault.

Free.,"Trump, Zelenskyy exit White House talks hopeful about security guarantee for Ukraine",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-zelenskyy-exit-white-house-talks-hopeful-about-security-guarantee-ukraine,,"President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies at the White House Monday celebrated Russian President Vladimir Putin’s concession of NATO-like security protections for Ukraine as part of a future peace deal between the two countries.Zelenskyy and officials from Western Europe called Putin’s acceptance of security guarantees for Ukraine protecting the nation against another attack a major step toward ending the three-year-old war.Dating to before the war, one point of tension between Ukraine and Russia has been Ukraine’s increasingly warm relationship with the West, with potential membership in NATO a major issue for Putin.But Trump said Putin accepted something like it during the pair’s meeting in Alaska last week.“The Alaska summit reinforced my belief that, while difficult, peace is within reach,” Trump said before a group meeting in the White House’s East Room. “In a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine.”Trump and Zelenskyy met one-on-one in the Oval Office before a handful of European leaders joined them for a multilateral meeting in the East Room.During introductions for the multilateral meeting, Zelenskyy said it had been his best meeting with Trump to date, and he was “very happy” with Trump about the possibility of winning security guarantees.“We spoke about it, and we will speak more about security guarantees,” he said. “This is very important that (the) United States gives such (a) strong signal and is ready for security guarantees.”The other attendees Monday were NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.‘Article 5-like’Several European allies highlighted the issue of security guarantees for Ukraine, which they compared to the NATO charter’s Article 5 that compels every member state to defend any other member that has been attacked.“It's very good to hear that we're working on the security guarantees,” von der Leyen said. “Article 5-like security guarantees: so important.”The next step in the peace process would be to set up direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy, possibly also to include Trump.Trump said he had spoken to Putin “indirectly” on Monday and that he planned to phone the Russian president following the meeting with European leaders.Ceasefire needed?Before meeting with Putin, Trump had supported a ceasefire as a path toward a permanent end to the war, though he came out of the Alaska summit closer to Putin’s position that a ceasefire was not necessary before a final peace agreement.Monday, he said he would like a ceasefire to immediately end violence, but that it was not strictly necessary from a diplomatic point of view. The United States had helped negotiate the ends of other conflicts without a temporary ceasefire in place, he said.“All of us would obviously prefer an immediate ceasefire while we work on a lasting peace,” he said. “I don't know that it's necessary.”Germany’s Merz pushed back, saying a ceasefire should be a precondition for a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting.“I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire,” Merz said. “So let's work on that, and let's try to put pressure on Russia, because the credibility of these efforts we are undertaking today are depending on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of the serious negotiations.”Smoother meeting with Zelenskyy in suitAt the open-press portion of Trump’s meeting with Zelenskyy, the two appeared on friendlier terms than they had during the Ukrainian leader’s last Oval Office visit in February, when Trump and Vice President JD Vance complained Zelenskyy was not appreciative enough of U.S. aid.As the February meeting turned heated, Trump told Zelenskyy he had “no cards” to fight Russia on his own or make demands of the United States.But Monday, Trump resisted an option to return to that argument, brushing off a reporter’s question about which country had “better cards.”And Zelesnkyy also wore an all-black suit Monday after a writer at a pro-Trump media outlet questioned him at the February meeting about wearing military-style attire.“You look fabulous in that suit,” the same writer said Monday.“I said the same thing,” Trump echoed.",,,,2025-08-18 18:56:53.443786

U.S. Agriculture officials announced a new initiative Monday to stop subsidies for solar energy panels that take up farmland while supporting cuts in agriculture grants to Tennessee universities.
Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Last week marked the first time since mid-June that statewide precipitation levels were below normal, while temperatures were 2-4 degrees above normal for the period, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan.
Despite the diminished precipitation levels, soil moisture remains high. Crops rated highly during the Aug. 11-17 reporting period, though developments for corn and soybean acres are slightly behind the five-year average, according to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Twenty-seven percent of corn has reached the dent stage, one day behind the average. Nearly 80% of Iowa corn is in the dough stage, making the crop three days behind the average. The crop continues to rate well, however with 30% of corn acres rated excellent for the reporting period. 


Crop phenological stages:
— Corn in dough stage: a thick or dough-like substance is present in all kernels.
— Corn in dent stage: all the kernels have dented, ear is firm and no milk is present in the kernels.
— Soybeans setting pods: pods are developing on lower portions of the plant, with some blooming still on top of plant.

All but 4% of soybean acres have started blooming across the state and 83% of soybean acres are setting pods, which is four days behind normal. Soybeans also rated well, with 60% of the crop good and 22% excellent. 
Agronomists and plant pathologists have noted this crop season has good conditions for sudden death syndrome, a fungal disease that can impact soybean yields. Cases of SDS have cropped up in most of the state but the total acreage impacted has not been calculated. 
Oat harvest is 91% complete across the state, and 65% of alfalfa hay acres have had a third cutting. 
Soil moisture conditions improved slightly from the previous reporting period, with a small decrease in the percent of surplus soil moisture. Overall, 72% of topsoil moisture conditions and 73% of subsoil moisture conditions were adequate. 
North central parts of the state continue to have the wettest soils, with 55% of topsoil rated surplus.
Glisan noted in the report that portions of eastern Iowa had above-average precipitation during the reporting period, but as a whole, the state average was eight-tenths of an inch, a little more than one-tenth below the normal. 
Some areas of the state recorded temperatures as high as 16 degrees above normal, though the average temperature for the period, at 74.8 degrees Fahrenheit, was just 2.8 degrees above the normal. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the “warm and muggy conditions didn’t deter visitors from enjoying another successful Iowa State Fair.” 
Naig, in a statement, also noted that Iowa had no drought conditions, per the U.S. Drought Monitor map, for the first time in more than a year. 
For farmers in southwest Iowa, where drought has been most persistent, the rain has been a welcome reprieve. Dale Maassen, who farms near Avoca, said he has had more rain since June than he got all of last year. 
“Right now, I can’t complain,” Maassen said. “It’s the best I’ve seen in quite a while.”

Standing near him is Gov. Larry Rhoden. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)National Guard troops on both sides of South Dakota are now processing paperwork for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden announced Monday that three guard members in Sioux Falls and three in Rapid City have begun to document and process ICE arrest information, which Rhoden said will let immigration agents stay in the field in search of migrants eligible for deportation. 
The National Guard also assigned a liaison to serve as the communication point between ICE and the six people working on immigration paperwork.
The news is part of a flurry of immigration enforcement activity in South Dakota since the inauguration of President Donald Trump. Rhoden ascended to the state’s chief executive post following the departure of his predecessor, Kristi Noem, to serve as secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the federal agency under which ICE operates.
‘Operation Prairie Thunder’ will assist with deportations and boost Sioux Falls law enforcement

The National Guard’s ICE assistance is part of a broader, branded effort from Rhoden dubbed “Operation Prairie Thunder.” 
Last week, Rhoden’s administration announced that the Board of Pardons and Paroles had granted early release to 10 men from various countries who lacked legal status and were in line for federal deportation proceedings upon their release from state custody.
South Dakota Democrats have bristled at the enforcement push, and have said Rhoden’s immigration efforts are “politicized.”
Correctional actions
On Monday, as part of his press release on the National Guard, Rhoden said the DOC had finalized its cooperation agreement with ICE, known as a 287(g) agreement. According to the agreement and ICE’s 287(g) website, the agreement was finalized on July 27.
Rhoden’s office did not immediately respond to a question on why the announcement came three weeks after the agreement was finalized.
Such agreements allow local agencies to work with ICE through one of three cooperation models. The DOC’s agreement was signed under the Jail Enforcement Model, which trains state-level officers to identify people without documentation of legal status and turn them over to ICE for removal.
The 10 inmates paroled last week were not identified by state correctional officers trained to work with ICE. They already had “ICE holds,” which is a term used in corrections to note which inmates are expected to move into ICE custody upon their release from state or local custody.
The DOC has yet to identify how many employees will be trained to work with ICE on investigating the status of inmates not already identified as in line for deportation, DOC spokesman Michael Winder said in an email on Monday. 
South Dakota Attorney General clarifies scope of immigration enforcement agreement

Rhoden previously signed a letter of intent to signal the prison system’s plans to commit to an ICE agreement earlier this summer, while announcing Operation Prairie Thunder. 
He also said at the time that ICE-trained state troopers would carry out limited immigration actions through the Highway Patrol’s 287(g) agreement. The agency finalized its Task Force Model agreement on May 22, according to the ICE website. That model essentially deputizes local law enforcement to work with ICE.
Broader efforts
In his press release, Rhoden characterized the latest developments with the DOC and the National Guard as efforts to “to keep South Dakota strong, safe, and free.”
There are now five state agencies with active 287(g) agreements. 
The state Division of Criminal Investigation is using the Task Force Model. Attorney General Marty Jackley, who leads that agency, has said his detectives will target undocumented people who’ve committed acts of violence.
Two local jails have agreements under the 287(g) Warrant Service Model. Under those agreements, staff at the Hughes and Minnehaha county jails can serve ICE warrants on people in custody, which saves ICE agents from appearing personally at the jail to do so.
All five of the agreements in South Dakota were finalized this year, after Trump signed an executive order to encourage more state and local agencies to sign 287(g) agreements.

Article Summary

A billboard promoting the Proud Boys, a right-wing extremist group, has been put up near a high school in Clinton County in southern Illinois.
The group, which has been labeled a hate group, has ties to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.
Local leaders expressed outrage but said the billboard is protected by the First Amendment.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include a comment from Gov. JB Pritzker’s office.
BREESE, Ill. — A billboard rising from a Clinton County cornfield near Breese that appears to be a recruiting tool for the Proud Boys — a far-right extremist group tied to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol — has touched off outrage in the small southern Illinois community.
The sign is located at Old U.S. Route 50 and St. Rose Road, about 1,000 feet from the entrance to Central Community High School. It lists a local phone number for people to call. Repeated calls to a phone number on the recruiting billboard went to a voicemail that is full.
Federal prosecutors secured seditious-conspiracy convictions against top Proud Boys leaders for their roles in the Capitol breach, including former chairman Enrique Tarrio, who received a 22-year sentence; he was pardoned by President Donald Trump along with others involved in the insurrection when he returned to office for a second term in January.
Originally the billboard was sitting atop another sign for Hospital Sisters Health Systems of Springfield, which has hospitals in southern Illinois, including Breese. At 4 p.m., a worker for Lamar Advertising was moving the Proud Boys billboard to the other side. A spokesperson for HSHS acknowledged that the billboard was placed above its existing hospital advertisement.
“An external company sells these billboards individually and we appreciate that the public and our patients understand there is no connection between HSHS and any message or organization represented on a billboard above ours,” the company said in a statement.
The Southern Poverty Law Center lists the Proud Boys as a hate group, and the Anti-Defamation League describes them as extremist; Canada designated the Proud Boys a terrorist entity in 2021. The United States does not maintain a domestic “terrorist list,” but FBI memos have described the group as an “extremist group with ties to white nationalism,” according to media reports.
After the Proud Boys were found guilty of vandalizing an African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., during a December 2020 pro-Trump rally, the church sued the group and Tarrio for hate crimes, vandalism, and conspiracy. A Superior Court judge in Washington granted the church a $2.8 million judgment and the rights to the group’s trademark. But the far-right group has continued to use the name anyway, according to news reports.
Clinton County Board Chair Brad Knolhoff told Capitol News Illinois he’d received calls and emails and had asked the county state’s attorney to review what, if anything, the county can do.
“I have forwarded to our state’s attorney just so he can look at it,” he said. The county, he explained, typically regulates “the size and the location” of a billboard, “but the language, we don’t … and I would estimate, the reason that that’s never been the case is just because we’re not really the arbiters of speech. The U.S. Constitution is pretty clear on freedom of speech. I think a billboard really falls in that lane no matter what it says.”
Knolhoff said some residents were expected to raise the issue at Monday night’s county board meeting, though the agenda was already finalized last week. “It’s not an action item that we have,” he said. Still, he encourages anyone to speak during the public comment period.
Breese resident Drew Kampwerth, who lives about a mile and a half from the billboard, said she first saw it at the end of last week. “It is sickening that they are putting it in front of a high school,” said Kampwerth, 30, who has four young children.
She said she’s concerned that the billboard “is putting out feelers” to impressionable teenagers in a predominantly white community. “They are letting people know there is a safe space for hate and I think that’s wrong,” she said. “This shouldn’t be made normal in our community,”
Breese Mayor Kevin Timmermann repeated multiple times that the billboard is on county land, though his city is the closest to it. He said the city’s legal counsel has cautioned him to “watch what we are saying about it.”
“For me personally, I am very opposed to this. I am totally opposed to it,” Timmerman said. “I am concerned about it, yes. But right now I have no authority over that sign.”
Gov. JB Pritzker’s office denounced the placement of the billboard, saying it has no place in Illinois.
“A few wasted advertising dollars will not change the fact that there are millions of Americans who, regardless of political affiliation, know them as an extreme fringe organization that does not reflect who the people of Illinois are,” governor’s spokesperson Alex Gough said in a statement.
Bill Freivogel, a journalism professor with a media-law background at Southern Illinois University, said the law gives governments little room to police billboard content, meaning the county “can’t force the Proud boys to take down their billboard,” he said. That doesn’t mean they can’t protest the content, he said, adding, “they could buy a competing billboard.”
The U.S. Supreme Court has long set limits on when offensive or incendiary speech can be restricted. In Brandenburg v. Ohio in 1969, the Court ruled that speech is protected unless it is intended and likely to incite imminent lawless action. In that case, Ku Klux Klan leader Clarence Brandenburg invited television cameras to a rally where Klansmen burned a cross, carried weapons and delivered racist, anti-Semitic speeches. That precedent has been tested repeatedly since.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Union workers at the Department of Children, Youth and Families’ (DCYF) central office in Providence have recently implored the state to not renew the agency’s lease of the building, citing health and safety concerns about the working conditions there.
Now, a few unwelcome visitors at the Friendship Street offices have temporarily forced the agency out of the building: A bat was found on the premises Sunday evening, according to an email DCYF Director Ashley Deckert sent to agency staff on Monday morning.
“We are taking this situation seriously and, out of an abundance of caution, will be moving to a fully remote work arrangement until further notice,” Deckert wrote in her message, which was obtained by Rhode Island Current. 
The email, sent at 8:32 a.m., noted that the building would close at 10 a.m. Deckert advised staff to grab any “essential items” for remote work before that time.
Shortly after noon Monday, DCYF spokesperson Barb Francella confirmed via email that the building was closed as of 10 a.m. Francella also confirmed that Sunday’s bat sighting follows another bat sighting on Thursday, Aug. 14. Pest control removed that bat the same day, and Francella said pest control is now working to remove the second bat.  
“Our pest control provider was called in to remove the bat this morning, inspect the building and determine the point of entry,” Francella wrote. “We are working closely with the landlord, property manager and pest control provider to address the issue and comply with all necessary standards.”
But the exodus from the Friendship Street office is not a total surprise to the DCYF workers unionized with SEIU Local 580, which comprises about 300 of the 460 workers in the building. Matthew Gunnip, the union’s president, shared a number of emails with Rhode Island Current which traced a clearer timeline for the bat saga.
Union members were notified in an email blast the morning of Aug. 14, with a short message that read, “There is an animal bat on the second floor. It has not been located.”
A few hours later, DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado wrote in an internal email to all staff that a “small bat” had been removed from the building’s second floor, and that staff in the area had been temporarily relocated. Pest control was on the scene within 30 minutes, Delgado wrote, and the bat was “safely removed” from the building and sent off to the state health department, where it would be tested for rabies. 
A copy of the rabies test results was not available from DCYF as of Monday afternoon.
Gunnip’s emails culminated in a Sunday evening request to DCYF leadership that the Providence office be shuttered Monday.
“What assurances does DCYF have that there are no additional bats in the building, and what corrective actions have been taken to ensure that the intervention on Thursday actually remedied the issue? How are workers to trust that this time there truly are no more bats in the building?” Gunnip wrote in the email, which was addressed to DCYF leadership as well as state health and administrative officials.  
Richard Charest — who leads the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services, which oversees a large roster of state agencies including DCYF — wrote to Gunnip Monday morning that he had spoken with Deckert and that employees would be allowed to work from home as the building is evaluated further.
Bats signal deeper problems, union claims
In his Sunday email, Gunnip cited several health concerns regarding the bats, from the risk of rabies to the potential spread of histoplasmosis, a respiratory illness that can be acquired from bat excrement, also known as guano. That is especially a concern, Gunnip wrote, as the Friendship Street office building uses recirculated air in its HVAC system — one of the factors identified as a culprit in what workers call the building’s poor air quality, and a major reason why the workforce wants to discontinue the current lease, which expires at the end of November. 
The State Properties Committee needed to approve the lease extension by the end of July, and was set to weigh in upon the proposed 10-year renewal at a July 22 meeting. Union pushback caused the committee to delay a vote until air-quality reports were completed and reviewed.
At a subsequent meeting on July 29, the committee delayed the vote again, and said it wants to schedule a public hearing on the lease renewal, but a meeting had not been scheduled as of Monday. 
Gunnip said in a phone call Monday afternoon that union leadership never received copies of the air quality report from DCYF directly, but instead saw the report for the first time when it was uploaded with a story published on Rhode Island Current.  
DCYF headquarters lease renewal still up in the air

DCYF leadership has previously said the Friendship Street building is safe, and characterized the union’s presence at the July 29 State Properties meeting — in which workers brought large photographs documenting building issues like mold and rodents — as “theatrics.”  
But the issues are not unique to DCYF, Gunnip said, noting he had spent his day starting the grievance process on behalf of a worker at the Department of Human Services building in Warwick, who is concerned that his recent headaches may be due to the building’s working conditions. 
Emails from the agency’s chief of staff said that the landlord performed testing recently and there was no mold present. But the building has had mold problems in the past, according to a Feb. 2024 analysis. 
SEIU Local 580 represents numerous social service agencies in Rhode Island’s public sector, many of them within the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, including the Department of Human Services. Gunnip said issues with aging buildings often leased by the state are only widening the rift between management and workers.
Gunnip said of the Warwick human services worker, “He’s thinking, ‘Am I just going crazy, or is it really the building?’ That’s the problem in and of itself. If it wasn’t a substandard building…then you know, that’d be a different story.”

The action was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska on behalf of Sabina Carmona-Lorenzo, whom the ACLU said was in the U.S. more than 25 years. She and her husband have five children, three of whom are minors. One is in college and the other in the U.S. military, the ACLU said.
Similar to at least three other recent lawsuits, including one filed by the ACLU for another woman, the latest argues that Carmona-Lorenzo’s continued detention extends beyond legal authority and violates her right to due process.
An Omaha-based immigration judge on July 15 granted that Carmona-Lorenzo be released upon posting a bond, but the federal government blocked the bond by invoking an “automatic stay.” Bond would have freed her to be with her family while her legal team built a case for why she should not be deported. 
The government acted after a leaked July 8 memo from the Trump administration offered new guidance that immigrant advocates say made nearly all who entered the country without authorization ineligible for bond while they battle deportation proceedings. 
Previously, undocumented immigrants already living in the U.S. generally were allowed to request a bond hearing before an immigration judge. But the memo said the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice had revisited the government’s legal position on detention and release and determined based on a different section of immigration law that such immigrants “may not be released from ICE custody.” 
In rare exceptions, an undocumented immigrant may be released on parole, but that decision will be up to an immigration officer, not a judge, ICE’s acting director told agents, according to the Washington Post, which reported the memo.
Two women caught in Omaha immigration raid reunite with families per judge’s order

The new guidance is based on a section of immigration law that says unauthorized immigrants “shall be detained” after their arrest, but historically that applied to those who recently crossed the border and not longtime U.S. residents.
Last week, U.S. District Court Senior Judge Joseph Bataillon ordered that two other women detained in the Omaha raid be released “immediately” after they re-posted bond, saying the government was unlawfully detaining the women, both from Mexico.
In those cases, both Yanier Garcia Jimenez and Floribertha Mayo Anicasio also had been granted release on bond by an immigration judge, yet for weeks continued to be detained under an automatic stay appeal by the feds.
A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Bataillon’s courtroom for the other worker represented by ACLU, Maria Reynosa Jacinto. All four women were jailed in the Lincoln County Detention Center North Platte, hours from their Omaha families, along with numerous others from the Glenn Valley raid. 
According to the ACLU, “These back-to-back cases highlight the urgent need for immigration authorities to comply with constitutional requirements and respect immigration court judges’ bond determinations.”

The GOP leaders denounced the 1,400 page omnibus bill, which they displayed on the podium and was passed by the Democratic majority in the closing moments of the 2024 legislative session. (Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer.)A Ramsey County District Court judge on Monday struck down a 2024 law banning binary trigger devices — which double the rate of fire of semiautomatic firearms — as a violation of the state constitution’s rule requiring legislation to be about a single subject.
Although just the binary trigger ban was struck down, Judge Leonardo Castro used sweeping language about the DFL-controlled Legislature’s violation of the single-subject rule, clearing the way for potential litigation over a bevy of subjects included in the law, from Uber and Lyft driver wages to paid leave provisions.
The ruling didn’t strictly address the legality of binary triggers, but instead focused on the 1,400-page bill in which the binary trigger ban was included last year. In the final moments of the 2024 session, the DFL-controlled Legislature passed an “omnibus” bill — think: everything but the kitchen sink — that included 13 separate subjects, including minimum pay rates for Uber and Lyft drivers; alterations to the state’s paid leave program; and changes to make the child tax credit more user-friendly.
The Minnesota Constitution states “no law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.” The purpose is to prevent legislators from steamrolling provisions into big bills with little notice.
But bills running several hundred pages about a multitude of subjects are common, no matter which party controls the Legislature.
Castro said in his ruling that the Minnesota Supreme Court has considered dozens of cases challenging the state Constitution’s single-subject clause since 1857.
The case challenging the binary trigger ban was brought by the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, arguing the 1,400-page omnibus bill in 2024 was unconstitutional.
Castro ruled that the bill included many provisions that had nothing to do with one another.
“The 2024 Omnibus Bill violates the Single Subject and Title Clause, because, at best, it contains many non-germane parts, and at worst, has no identifiable common theme,” Castro wrote.
Despite his sweeping language, Castro employed judicial restraint. He refrained from invalidating all the provisions in the 1,400-page bill and only struck down the binary trigger ban. He did so because Minnesota Supreme Court precedent states that courts should favor striking certain provisions rather than invalidating entire bills, he wrote.
“But make no mistake, during the late hours of May 19, 2024, lawmaking did not ‘occur within the framework of the Constitution,’” Castro concluded. “This Court respectfully suggests that if there has ever been a bill without common theme and where ‘all bounds of reason and restraint seem to have been abandoned,’ this is it; and if there has ever been time for the ‘draconian result of invalidating the entire law,’ that time is now.”
Democrats proposed the binary trigger ban after a man fatally shot and killed two Burnsville police officers and a paramedic in early 2024.
“The state has repeatedly tried to bury gun control provisions inside sprawling omnibus bills. Today’s ruling makes clear that this practice violates the Minnesota Constitution, ” Senior Vice President of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus Rob Doar said in a press release.
A spokesperson for Gov. Tim Walz confirmed that the state will appeal the ruling. 
“This law was passed in the aftermath of the horrific killing of three first responders in Burnsville, and was intended to help ensure such a tragedy does not happen again. The governor stands firmly behind this law and plans to appeal this decision,” the spokesperson said.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/P1163350-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

The suit against Santa Fe Spa Center (aka Voupre Spa or SHM Group 2019, Inc.) accused the business of employing “aggressive and deceptive practices to lure individuals into the store,” a news release says, and then would often charge customers more than the prices upon which they had agreed.
In addition to the $350,000, the AG’s settlement with the spa requires the business to:
• report within 30 days to the AG if it changes its name or other identifying features that “could affect consumer recognition of the entity responsible for the transaction”;
• provide customers with itemized receipts and complete transactions “within the confines of each retail location”
• create and maintain a return policy that complies with the Unfair Practices Act; is disclosed to customers; and is available in writing.
A news release says the New Mexico Department of Justice will reach out to customers who have already filed a complaint with the office, but other complainants have until Feb. 10, 2026 to submit a claim.
“Our Department has been hard at work on this case, and we are proud to return money to consumers who were targeted and financially harmed,” Torrez said in a statement. “Visitors and locals alike should never be charged thousands of dollars more than a fair price, nor should they be subjected to high-pressure sales tactics and false promises designed to trick them into buying products they don’t want or need. This case underscores our commitment to protecting consumers in New Mexico and holding bad actors fully accountable for exploiting our communities.

Mike DeWine will send 150 military police from his state's National Guard; Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves will send 200 members; South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster approved 200 members; and West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey will send up to 400 National Guard members.McMaster and Morrisey added that the federal government would cover the cost of deploying state troops.Unknown how long Guard will stayIt’s unclear how long National Guard members will remain on duty in the district. National Guard members are usually deployed for natural disasters and kept in reserve. Most have civilian jobs and families that they are pulled away from when they are activated.The Department of Defense did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.The president has 23 days left in his emergency declaration and has signaled he wants to extend the emergency longer, as well as request funding from Congress to finance his plans for the district. He’s directed federal law enforcement officers to not only conduct local policing, but to clear out camps of homeless people.It’s not the first time Republican governors have signaled they will deploy their National Guard members at Trump’s request. Iowa’s Kim Reynolds has stated she will send troops to help with the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans.And last week Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee said he’s prepared to send his National Guard members to the district. He added that U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll told him that the military might request states to send troops to the district for law enforcement.The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.Lee’s office did not respond to States Newsroom's request for comment.Vermont Gov.

Wes Moore, has not received a request from the Pentagon to send in National Guard members, according to a spokesperson for Moore’s office.A spokesperson for Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said there are no current plans for a deployment of National Guard troops from the state.Laura Strimple, communications director for Republican Gov. Jim Pillen of Nebraska, said in a statement that the governor supported the president’s “initiatives to reduce crime and clean up the streets in our nation’s capital, including placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal leadership and tasking the District of Columbia National Guard and National Guard troops from several nearby states with security in Washington.”“At this time, the Nebraska National Guard is not part of this mission,” she added.A spokesperson for Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis did not directly answer States Newsroom’s question if the state, which is preparing for Category 4 Hurricane Erin, had received a request from the Trump administration to send National Guard members to the district.“We stand ready to mobilize any resources necessary in response to President Trump’s federal priorities,” the spokesperson said.The rest of the state offices did not respond to States Newsroom’s requests for comment.",,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

Tina Bojanowski, D-Louisville, confers with Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball about education data before the start of Monday’s Interim Joint Committee on Education meeting. (LRC Public Information)A Democratic lawmaker asked Republican Auditor Allison Ball if her office’s recent critical audit of the Kentucky Department of Education makes the case for Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposal for universal pre-K. 
Ball presented the findings of the audit released last month during a Monday meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Education. The audit said “widespread improvements” are needed across the agency, which oversees all public education for the state’s K-12 students. 
Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, of Lexington, asked if the audit’s findings on low readiness for kindergarten supported the governor’s argument for offering all Kentucky children universal pre-K before they enter kindergarten. 
  Senate Minority Caucus Chair Reginald Thomas, D-Lexington, asks a question during a July meeting. (LRC Public Information)
“Doesn’t your report make the case that Kentucky needs to follow the rest of the country now and adopt some form of universal pre-K?” Thomas asked. “Is the governor absolutely correct in pushing for that? And if you disagree with that, then explain why not?”
The Democratic governor has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide, but the idea has not gained traction in the Republican-controlled state legislature. Beshear signed an executive order to establish an advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky earlier this summer. 
Ball said that “if we’re not doing a good job on that at this point, then we don’t want to expand that out to other kids.” The audit’s findings on kindergarten readiness between 2018 and 2023 “revealed overall kindergarten readiness levels below 50% for each year with performance declining in the most recent three years.” 
“So, step one would be to make sure our preschools are performing to the highest level they can be,” Ball said, adding that her takeaway would be to fix that first.
 Only about 27% of Kentucky’s 4-year-olds were enrolled in a state-funded preschool program during the 2023-24 school year, according to data presented last week to Beshear’s Pre-K for All Advisory Committee. Kentucky’s neighbor, West Virginia, which offers universal pre-K, enrolled 67% of its 4-year-olds in a state preschool program during that same time. Iowa and Oklahoma enrolled 66% of their 4-year-olds.

Ball’s audit report of KDE said “widespread improvements are needed across the agency.” For about 45 minutes, Ball gave lawmakers an overview of the more than 550-page document Monday. KDE did not address lawmakers during the meeting. 
The General Assembly passed legislation in 2024 directing the auditor to review the education agency. 
Ball said that it was an opportune time to do the audit as KDE crafts its strategic plan and “and this will help them, I think, quite a bit to be able to accomplish that in the most effective way.” Also, lawmakers will deliberate the next biennial state budget when they reconvene in Frankfort in January. 
The auditor emphasized during her presentation a need for KDE and the Kentucky Board of Education to have measurable benchmarks instead of broad goals and to improve communication issues between education leaders in Kentucky. 
Ball also encouraged lawmakers to think about how the legislature can address issues with budget appropriations, such as providing funding for math and literacy coaches and addressing a shortage of school counselors. The auditor said her team found that 628 more counselors are needed in Kentucky. 
“We discovered that nearly half of all school districts don’t meet the recommended counselor to student ratio of 1 to 250 students,” Ball said. “And that actually sounds like quite a lot to me, even as it is, but that’s our goal right now.” 
The School Safety and Resiliency Act passed in 2019 set a goal for school districts to have at least one counselor for every 250 students. It also said counselors should spend at least 60% of their time providing direct services to students. 
The audit also covered some financial issues, including a finding that KDE failed to use $250 million that could have gone into bolstering underfunded areas of education during fiscal years 2021-24. However, the department disputed the finding in its response to the report.
Ball also said that KDE could do more when it comes to sexual assault prevention and raising awareness in schools. Some issues auditors found were that there is not a database to track middle and high school coaches being investigated or charged with inappropriate behavior towards minors. Also, the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) does not have a tracking system for Title IX complaints. 
Title IX is a federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs that receive federal funding. The law has gained attention recently after a federal judge reaffirmed his decision to block Biden administration Title IX rules, including those aimed at protecting LGBTQ+ students from discrimination in schools, earlier this year. 
Ball said “boys playing in girls sports” is “still a national issue” that can come up in Title IX complaints. The General Assembly passed a law banning transgender womens and girls from playing on female sports teams in the state in 2022.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/bojanowski081825-1024x697.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

Mere months ago, the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project was furloughing staff, reeling from federal funding cuts that slashed about half of the group’s budget. 
Now, the key immigration law organization helping noncitizens fight detention and removal in Vermont is expanding rapidly, according to Executive Director Jill Martin Diaz. That’s thanks to both private donations — some in the six figures — as well as a $100,000 grant from the Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund. 
“For better or worse, this year has taught me how to run a business,” Martin Diaz said. 
The asylum assistance project is the first recipient of money from the legal defense fund. A group of well-connected leaders and elected officials announced the fund in May, quickly raising more than $30,000 in donations online after that rollout, according to Natalie Silver, a consultant for the fundraising operation.

More than three months in, the fund, created to expand legal resources for Vermonters facing immigration proceedings, has raised $250,000, a quarter of the way to its $1 million goal. 
As President Donald Trump’s administration ramps up immigration enforcement nationwide, the effects have hit Vermont, with noncitizens detained, incarcerated in the state’s prisons and moved by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement around the country. Few attorneys in Vermont have immigration law expertise, a niche that the legal defense fund and asylum assistance project have looked to fill. 
“This is something Vermonters really care about,” Silver said. “What we have learned is that people are fired up about the fact that there are people in our communities who are being pushed through this system without ever speaking to an attorney.”
Silver said the fund has received money from more than 700 individual donors, and has benefited from partnerships, like one with Vermont Green Football Club, which raised $25,000.
“There is an urgent need. The need is only increasing,” she said. 
Martin Diaz agreed. The asylum assistance project is looking to increase its partnerships by having staff work alongside other community organizations, growing the clinic’s regional reach. The organization is also increasing its work in Vermont’s prisons, where legal staff can meet people in need of representation. 
“This is a system that’s overdue for Vermont, and we want to sustain it going forward,” they said. 
In the next few months, the project will bring on two new legal fellows, as well as an intake specialist and a director of operations, among other positions, according to Martin Diaz. On the back of strong fundraising, the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project plans to more than double its spending, from $383,000 last fiscal year to more than $1.05 million this year. 
Martin Diaz described this whirlwind period as bittersweet. On the one hand, the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project has taken off. But that’s due to the surge in immigration enforcement since Trump took office, and meanwhile, other organizations engaged in similar work have suffered from federal funding cuts. 
“To think that in just a few months we pivoted so dramatically, it’s stunning,” they said.

The money will be used to support regional behavioral health planning as required under new Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act — passed by state lawmakers and enacted earlier this year — which seeks to rebuild behavioral health services in the state.
The law requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to divide the state into behavioral health regions, each of which will identify five behavioral health priorities over the next four years.
Last May, Health Care Authority Behavioral Health Services Division Director Nick Boukas laid out a timeline for implementing the law, which the statutorily created five-member Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act Executive Committee approved earlier this month.

“This funding will help each behavioral health region identify its priorities, engage stakeholders and create an implementation plan that reflects available resources and addresses community needs,” AOC Director Karl Reifsteck, a member of the state’s Behavioral Health Reform and Investment Act Executive Committee, said in a statement.
An AOC news release says the “planning funding process encourages stakeholders in each region to collaborate in
identifying an entity – such as a local or tribal government – to apply for funding and coordinate” the planning work.
Any entity that applies for funding will be required to have a letter of support from county managers in each of the counties within their regions. The money for planning can cover work such as establishing committees; organizing community meetings; and hosting workshops.
Regions are required to co-host at least one community listening session as directed by AOC, according to a memo from the court’s Behavioral Health Investment and Reform Administrator Esperanza Lucero.
Requests for planning funding must be submitted to the AOC by Sept. 30, and will be proceeded by two informational sessions at the end of August and the beginning of September.
“The funding will lay the foundation to build a sustainable regional network for delivering behavioral health services to New Mexicans,” Lucero said in a statement.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_9775-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “How a Berlin couple got billed for a CT legislator’s E-ZPass tolls,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Paz, this is a fascinating revelation that you’ve done here, into the confusion regarding the assignment of low digit number plates in Connecticut. These are supposed to be specialized plates, so how come different people would get the same number?
MP: Well, yes, this is something I think that will surprise people, that every state, Connecticut included, has several classifications of motor vehicle license plates, and many states, not all, but Connecticut included, they will use the same numbers for different classes of plates, which is of no great moment, typically. But you know, my story focuses on the troubles that a couple had because the E-ZPass photographic readers confuse their plate with that of a legislator who had this same number.
WSHU: Tell us a little bit about the background of Dick and Gail Benson of Berlin and how they got into this trouble.
MP: There’s a great irony here. The Bensons are not entirely amused by it, but they do certainly see the joke, and that is that Dick Benson was an aide to Governor Weicker and Senator Weicker for many years, and in that function, one of the chores he was given at the end of the Weicker administration is to distribute these low digit plates, one, two and three digit plates that the political class seems to think is kind of a cool thing to have. And he was charged with distributing what was left. And he was told, you know, take one for yourself and your wife. And Dick Benson is a disabled Vietnam vet. And he took the number three disabled vet plate and gave his wife a plate that was 145. And 145 happens to be the district number of a young state rep named Corey Paris in Stamford.
WSHU: Now let’s get back to why state legislators get the number plates low numbers — because of their districts, right?
MP: Right. They are the district numbers, and the plates are distinctive to the naked eye from a regular passenger plate. The plates have two blue stripes and it says legislative plate. So in most circumstances, there is not, you know, real confusion, although, as I was doing the reporting on this, I did, I did suggest to legislative authorities that perhaps it would make sense for legislative plate, if you were from the house to have, oh, I don’t know, maybe the letter H before the number.
WSHU: Now, Corey Paris, state legislator from Stamford, has the same number as Gail Benson, and he has been going into areas where his license plate number has been read by the E-ZPass cameras. So what happened after that?
MP: So one day in November at the end of 2023, Gail Benson got a notice of an unpaid parking ticket in West Hartford, which she found odd, because she had not been to West Hartford in some time. And when she inquired, and West Hartford officials looked at it, they found that the car was not a Volvo, which is what she drives. It was a Kia, which Corey Paris drives. And after consulting with the department motor vehicle, they straightened it out. Then, in fact, it was Corey Paris’s car. And then they thought, well, we better check our E-ZPass statement to make sure there’s no other confusion. And they found hundreds and hundreds of dollars in tolls that they had been paying. You know, their E-ZPass account is on auto pay. And I don’t know about you, but I’m not terribly attentive to certain bills that come in on auto pay. And so it went on for at least a year and a half.
WSHU: Wow.
MP: Yeah.
WSHU: It must have racked up quite a bit.
MP: So what ensued is it was made clear that E-ZPass is not the easiest organization to deal with, and they eventually got some credits back on their bills. And then finally, when I started inquiring, they also got a final check for another 240 bucks and Corey Paris said he was unaware of it, because he had an old E-ZPass, which he said he was unaware had become inactive. So he also was not checking his statements, if indeed he was getting any. And so he had his own problem in trying to straighten out what he owed. And in fact, at some point, E-ZPass was trying to ding him for late payments on charges that he had never received.
WSHU: You mentioned the fact that it’s not easy dealing with the bureaucracy of E-ZPass. Tell us a little bit about your experience trying to sort this out.
MP: Well, going through the E-ZPass customer service, there was no luck there. I had better luck with the MTA Bridge and Tunnel authority. They did look into it, although they would not provide anyone for an interview to just sort of answer basic questions about, is there a written policy for handling these mistakes? You know, mistakes are inevitable. There are, you know, billions of transactions. E-ZPass is available in 17 states. In New York alone, there are six different tolling authorities. And you know, so you know, this stuff happens, but it was, it was pretty maddening to try to get some straight answers. At one point when they informed me that they had reviewed their files and they were sending a refund, I was told, so therefore, “there’s no story here, right?”
WSHU: Interesting. What about the Connecticut DMV? You spoke with them. What’s their take on all of this?
MP: Well, you know, the Connecticut DMV, like every DMV, is much maligned, but I have to tell you, in this story, the only bureaucracy that the Bensons and Corey Paris praised was the DMV, they said that they did what they could to help straighten this out. You know, they are not a direct player in this, as everyone knows, Connecticut does not have tolls, but there are interstate compacts in which their files are available to E-ZPass, and that’s how E-ZPass can attach a photograph of a plate to an address and send a bill by mail if you don’t have the E-ZPass transponder.
WSHU: So Paz, what’s the bottom line here? Is it going to be any easier dealing with E-ZPass going forward? Is there any indication there might be some type of policy change?
MP: No. I don’t see any possibility of that. Based on years of them dealing with these kinds of things, I did find other cases, sporadic cases around the country, and there’s a similarity, and that is people tended to get refunds after the media started looking into it. You know, I don’t know why this is so difficult for them now, part of it is the fault of these states having duplicate numbers on different classifications of plates.
WSHU: There are 10 number threes in Connecticut.
MP: Yes, including a state representative, Minnie Gonzalez (D-Hartford). But I talked to her, and she actually said, it’s funny, it seems to work for her. She does not have a transponder. But she said, you know, just last week, she was up on the Mass Pike, and she did get a bill by mail. So apparently it works sometimes. But the DMV people told me that in their experience, there seems to be a tendency of the electronic plate readers to default to an assumption that they are a passenger plate and not one of the other classifications, you know. And so when it comes to plate number three, you know that Dick Benson has, there’s a fire truck that has a number three. There’s at least one legislator, although the state senator from the third district does not have legislative plates, and some legislators just, you know, they can’t be bothered because you have to have a regular registration. You get the legislative plate by paying an extra $14 and some people like to have it on their car. I don’t know about you, but I like to be anonymous.
WSHU: That’s why I wasn’t surprised that Senator Anwar preferred not to have one. Thank you so much Mark. I really appreciate it.
MP: Thank you.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7561-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 17:57:33.117713

Michael Caruso. (Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis has appointed state Rep. Mike Caruso to serve as Palm Beach County clerk of the circuit court and comptroller, the governor’s office announced Monday.
Caruso was the lone vote against some legislation disfavored by the governor during the 2025 legislative session, signaling his loyalty to DeSantis during a time when Speaker of the House Daniel Perez and the governor did not see eye-to-eye.
House leadership removed Caruso as chairman of the House Infrastructure Subcommittee and moved his office after he voted against a legislative immigration enforcement package that conflicted with the governor’s.
Monday afternoon, Caruso’s office announced he had resigned from the House, one year before he would be term-limited out of office.
“It has been the honor of my life to serve the people of Florida,” Caruso said. “I am deeply thankful to my constituents for their trust, my colleagues for their partnership, and most especially Governor DeSantis for the opportunity to continue serving the citizens of Palm Beach County in this important capacity.”
In his new role, Caruso will manage public records and court documents and oversee county finances.
“I look forward to bringing the same dedication, integrity, and results-driven approach I’ve shown in the legislature to the Clerk’s Office,” Caruso said. “Palm Beach County deserves the most transparent, efficient, and fraud-free system of public service.”
Caruso, a Delray Beach Republican, was first elected to the House in 2018.
The position Caruso will take up was vacated by Democrat Joseph Abruzzo, a former state senator and representative. Abruzzo was elected as clerk of circuit court and comptroller in 2020 and left the spot in June when he became Palm Beach County’s administrator.

The suit was brought by parents of two disabled students and challenged by Disability Rights Montana.
“This is a huge win for Montana students,” said David Carlson, executive director of Disability Rights Montana. “Students with disabilities were being exited from school before earning a high school diploma and before they were ready to transition to post-secondary employment, education and independent living. Now students who need it will have the additional time that federal law allows to prepare for success as adults.”
Montana’s special education was offered through the age of 19, but state leaders had insisted for years that a certificate of completion of an individual education plan was equal to a high school diploma, and therefore, public schools were not obligated to keep disabled students until the age of 22, as most other states mandate.
Some states, according to Disability Rights Montana, provide services until the age of 26.
Parents of two students sued the state, saying that Montana was using the terms interchangeably in order to shirk responsibility for the additional years of support required by the Free Appropriate Public Education concept within the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
In court documents, officials from the state’s Office of Public Instruction admitted that a high school diploma was not equivalent or interchangeable with an individual education plan, which is usually a document created by a team of teachers, specialists and administrators that outlines an education plan tailored specifically to that student’s abilities, rather than a general curriculum outlined for a high school diploma in the state.
The change, which will take effect beginning in the upcoming 2025-’26 school year, means that districts will continue to provide support and education for individuals with disabilities who are not following a general diploma track.
Moreover, the agreement, signed by U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen, says that Montana must make attempts to reach students who were cycled out of the school districts but are younger than 22 years old. Those students will now become eligible for an updated individual education plan as well as support services, as part of the legal agreement.
While the State of Montana, including Gov. Greg Gianforte, have agreed that they will not admit they broke the law, they will also be responsible for legal fees for the parents and Disability Rights Montana.
  What comes next? 

As part of the agreement signed last week, Hedalen said that the Office of Public Instruction will begin to issue guidance documents to districts and special education cooperatives that say that Free Appropriate Public Education will be made available to all eligible disabled students until their 22nd birthday.
“Issuing a diploma based on the student’s completion of his or her individual education plan goals does not terminate their eligibility,” Christensen said in the order.
OPI has also said that it will create a plan to communicate with students who “were improperly exited” during the 2024-’25 year, according to the court order and agreement. It will also have to contact each student identified at their last known address with a copy of the judgment and documents to request re-enrollment. The office will have 30 days to send out the notice, and students’ families will have 30 days to return the documentation.
“Critically, students with disabilities who were improperly exited last school year only have 30 days after receiving the notice from their school to complete and return the re-enrollment paperwork,” said a press release from Disability Rights Montana.
The office also agreed to provide ongoing information and training that covers the requirements of the agreement, court documents said. Christensen’s court will also handle any complaint arising out of the agreement, according to court documents.
The agreement will remain in place until the Montana Legislature decides to adopt state law that follows the federal requirements.

During a forum sponsored by the Sutherland Institute on Monday, Utah Republican Rep. Blake Moore, who represents the area, started his remarks acknowledging the incident and describing it as “a realization of how difficult that job is.”
“We’ve got a great mayor up in Tremonton, a town you don’t often hear this type of stuff happen from, so it’s a little shocking, no matter where it happens,” Moore said. “My heart goes out to northern Utah, and Box Elder County.” 
Other members of Utah’s congressional delegation also lamented the news in prepared statements.
Sen. John Curtis said on X he was “heartbroken by the tragic loss of two law enforcement officers in Tremonton last night.” 
“‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,’” Sen. Mike Lee quoted from the Bible on X as he asked his followers to join him in praying for the law enforcement officers, their families and the Tremonton community.
Rep. Burgess Owens also called for prayers for the fallen officers, the recovery of the wounded deputy and the safety of the state’s law enforcement community on a social media post, describing the incident as “heartbreaking news.”
A male suspect is currently in custody in the Box Elder County Jail under investigation of aggravated murder, a capital crime in Utah.

Brad McVay was sworn in as statewide prosecutor Monday by Attorney General James Uthmeier. It is one of the top positions in the Florida Department of Legal Affairs and takes the lead in investigations that cross multiple county and judicial circuit lines.
McVay spent the past seven years holding top positions in the Department of State, including more than four years as general counsel, responsible for defending Florida’s election laws against multiple lawsuits filed by voting-rights groups. 
McVay also worked as deputy secretary, managing the state’s election crimes office, created at the urging of Gov. Ron DeSantis.
McVay, a graduate of the Florida State University College of Law, spent five years as an assistant state prosecutor earlier in his career.
Uthmeier, during the swearing-in event, said McVay was one of “many qualified” applicants for the post, but he decided that he would be the best person to take on drug cartels, fight election fraud, and help protect children.
“He’s the right man for the job,” Uthmeier said. “He’s a good man. He’s an honorable man.”
Nick Cox, first appointed by then-Attorney General Pam Bondi, had been statewide prosecutor since 2011. He stepped down earlier this year to take a top job with State Attorney Suzy Cox in Hillsborough County.
In brief remarks following his swearing-in, McVay promised that “we will strive to be fast, fearless, relentless, and smart.”
DeSantis appointed Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, as attorney general after he selected then-Attorney General Ashley Moody to fill the Senate seat vacated by Marco Rubio, now U.S. secretary of state.

President Donald Trump’s US Department of Justice is suing the State Board over the missing information. State Elections Director Sam Hayes told the board at a recent meeting that the plan for collecting information may help settle the lawsuit.

He challenged the votes of more than 60,000 people in his failed attempt to overturn the election of his Democratic opponent for a seat on the state Supreme Court based on what he said was missing registration information.
Griffin’s voter challenge and lawsuits, in turn, mirrored a state GOP and Republican National Committee lawsuit against the state elections board that sought to purge 225,000 voters before the 2024 election.

Article Summary

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is seeking to block the Trump administration from withholding $54 million from the state that would aid crime victims.
The administration is seeking to withhold the funding due to Illinois’ immigration enforcement policies that prohibit state law enforcement from working with immigration officials in some circumstances.
The lawsuit is one of 35 that Raoul has filed or joined against the Trump Administration.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on the story. 

SPRINGFIELD – Attorney General Kwame Raoul announced Monday that he has joined a multistate lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from withholding federal funding to support crime victims in Illinois due to the state’s policy on immigration.
The lawsuit is one of 35 such suits challenging Trump administration policies that Raoul has joined as part of a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general. That’s an average of more than one suit per week since Trump resumed office on Jan. 20.
The latest suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, argues that the U.S. Department of Justice has imposed unlawful conditions on the distribution of funds under the federal Victims of Crime Act, a 1984 law that provides funding to help crime victims deal with costs resulting from crimes, including medical bills, counseling services and lost wages.
The money is distributed to states through a series of grant programs. States then distribute their share of the money to programs and agencies that provide services or aid to crime victims. For the current federal fiscal year, which runs through Sept. 30, more than $1.3 billion is supposed to be available nationwide, including about $54 million for Illinois.
Raoul’s office said the funding supports such programs as victim and witness advocacy services, emergency shelters, medical, funeral and burial expenses, crime scene cleanup, and sexual assault forensic exams.
Trump administration conditions
According to the lawsuit, however, the Trump administration has attached new and unlawful conditions to the distribution of those funds.
Those conditions were spelled out in a July 21 Notice of Funding Opportunity, which provides that funding may not be used for any “program or activity that, directly or indirectly, violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law … or impedes or hinders the enforcement of federal immigration law.”
According to the notice, that includes complying with a federal statute that prohibits state and local governments from restricting communication with immigration officials.
The lawsuit alleges that the requirement is more than a limit on the allowable use of funds but actually serves as an eligibility requirement, meaning any state or local jurisdiction with laws or policies in place that limit their law enforcement agencies from fully cooperating with federal immigration authorities will be deemed ineligible.
At issue in Illinois, according to the lawsuit, is the state’s 2017 TRUST Act, which, among other things, prohibits state and local law enforcement officials from assisting federal immigration agents in enforcement operations, giving immigration agents access to detained individuals or giving agents nonpublic information about the release dates of detained individuals.
“Conditioning that vital funding on cooperation with immigration enforcement is not just unlawful, it is immoral,” Raoul said during a news conference Monday. “VOCA (Victims of Crime Act) funds have no relationship to civil immigration policy. In fact, grants are distributed based on a statutory formula that has nothing to do with immigration.”
The lawsuit argues those conditions violate the federal Administrative Procedures Act, that they exceed the Justice Department’s legal authority and that they violate U.S. Constitution’s spending clause and separation of powers doctrine. It also asks the court to permanently enjoin enforcement of the conditions.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 20:48:32+00:00,CT Mirror,CT gets $53M in farm disaster funds; applications could open in fall,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-usda-disaster-relief-funds/,CT was awarded $53 million of a federal block grant to help small and midsized farmers recoup weather-related losses from 2023 and 2024.,"After months of negotiations between state and federal officials, Connecticut will receive about $53 million from a federal block grant designed to help small and midsized farmers recoup weather-related crop losses.
Connecticut famers have been awaiting access to federal relief after experiencing damages caused by disasters and extreme weather in 2023 and 2024. Now that the state knows its portion of the federal funding approved by Congress last year, Connecticut is closer to operating its own crop loss program, with plans to open applications to receive relief in the fall.
The state’s allocation is about a quarter of the $220 million Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program, which is open to every state in New England plus Hawaii and Alaska. The amount awarded to Connecticut was about 63.5% of the state’s $82.3 million request. Farmers and lawmakers who had been pushing for finalizing the details of the program say they are satisfied with what Connecticut will receive.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed state Agriculture Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt’s office Friday about the allocation of $53 million. Connecticut is still waiting for USDA to approve of its program design and the execution of a contract, which the state expects to happen in September.
State officials will then start administering the program, though the exact timeline has yet to be determined. They are aiming for implementation some time in the fall, with more details to come about what eligible farmers will need in terms of paperwork and documentation to be able to tap into the $53 million pool.
The Connecticut Department of Agriculture “remains committed to providing a flexible, inclusive and farmer-centered recovery approach which meets the needs of the diversity of CT farmers, including small and medium-sized producers who have traditionally not participated in other national USDA programs,” the state agency wrote in its latest update about the grant on Friday.
Smaller farming states that grow more specialty crops don’t typically benefit from federal assistance in the same ways as larger producers that grow commodity crops like corn, soybeans and wheat. Most farmers in Connecticut don’t have crop insurance.
That prompted U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, and other lawmakers to push for more federal relief. The block grant was tucked into legislation last December to fund the federal government. It was designed to only apply to small and medium farming states where eligibility didn’t hinge on whether a farmer has crop insurance.
One of the influences behind establishing such a block grant was William Dellacamera, a farmer in North Branford who has been advocating for federal relief for months.
He is coming up on the one-year mark of the 13-minute hail storm that destroyed Cecarelli’s Harrison Hill Farm last August. A month later, he traveled to Washington, D.C., on his tractor to push for help from the federal government.
In December, Congress passed a government funding bill with billions of dollars in emergency disaster aid, including the $220 million Farm Recovery and Support Block Grant Program.
But as months went by with little developments and ongoing negotiations, Dellacamera came back to the nation’s capital to ask about the status of the farm block grant. He met with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on two occasions as he made his plea for the quick rollout of the money for small and midsize farmers.
Dellacamera feels hopeful the money allotted for Connecticut will cover a lot of the losses for farmers like him. He said he didn’t expect the number to be as high as it was, noting that the $53 million is four times higher than what the state received under the last supplemental disaster program.
“It’s a big number. It should go a long way,” Dellacamera said. “We got the money right now. There’s still a lot more that needs to get done.”
DeLauro, the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, called the state’s allocation a “game changer.” She also credited fellow Connecticut representatives John Larson and Joe Courtney as well as Dellacamera and Hurlburt for helping get the program to final stages.
“I designed this historic block grant program to remove barriers for New England farmers like crop insurance requirements because our federal farm safety net fails so many of our specialty crop producers, and to give Connecticut the flexibility to decide when and where relief is needed,” DeLauro said in a statement. “This announcement is a major step towards putting dollars in the hands of farmers who have endured massive losses, and it is a dramatic improvement over what has been provided in the past.”
Earlier in the summer, disagreements emerged over the rollout of the disaster aid block grant.
As negotiations between federal officials and state counterparts continued, the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave states two options. They could run their own crop loss program by using the block grant tailored for them, but they wouldn’t get access to a larger pot of supplemental disaster aid — the option that Connecticut ultimately chose. Or they could go with the latter, run by the federal agency, but face limits on what gets covered by the block grant.
Connecticut decided it would develop a state-run program using the federal block grant. That meant the state wouldn’t get access to the $21 billion Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
After learning of the USDA’s proposals in late May, eligible states scrambled to make an assessment and meet the deadline to make a decision between the two funding streams — before knowing how much they’d get from the block grant. States weighed which option made more sense for their farmers before they knew how much of the $220 million block grant they would receive.
Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture argued the block grant option would give the state more flexibility for specialty crop operations, especially since the supplemental disaster funds might not cover many of the farmers and producers in Connecticut.
At that time, the state agency and Connecticut’s congressional delegation pushed back against the USDA’s parameters that states cannot participate in both programs.
Questions emerged over the potential of double dipping and farmers getting money to cover the same thing.
DeLauro had argued the federal agency was going against the intentions of Congress in how it wrote the law, saying they interpreted the special grant as a supplement for smaller farmers who don’t always qualify for traditional disaster relief. A group of 29 Democratic lawmakers who represented the eligible block-grant states framed it as a “bait and switch” that pitted two disaster aid programs against each other.
For its part, USDA placed the blame on Democratic lawmakers, contending that they were delaying aid. The federal agency argued members were looking “to manufacture controversy and blame the Trump Administration.”
Ultimately, Connecticut chose the farm block grant money in June, and regular negotiations continued over the next couple of months.
Since Connecticut went in that direction, it will be fully in charge of administering the program and doling out the eventual compensation. 
Farmers like Dellacamera feel like Connecticut will benefit more from this avenue than they would have through the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program. But since the block grant only covers weather losses from the past two years, he is worried about what relief farmers may need after this year, especially as Connecticut currently faces dry conditions.

The truck driver, Harjinder Singh, entered the United States illegally in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
Singh hold a California commercial driver’s license, the department said.
The three people inside a minivan died after crashing into a semi truck driven by Singh, who “recklessly, and without regard for the safety of others, attempted to execute a U-Turn utilizing an unauthorized location,” the department said in a news release.
The crash occurred on the Florida Turnpike near Fort Pierce.
Troopers, citing a 287(g) agreement allowing them to act for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, issued a detainer for Singh.

On Fox & Friends, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said the crash “shows how dangerous the open-border policies under Obama and Biden have been that have continued to wreak havoc on communities across the country.”
Singh, Florida officials allege, crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term in the White House.
“The actions taken by the Defendant while operating a commercial tractor-trailer are both shocking and criminal,” FLHSMV Executive Director Dave Kerner said in a news release. “Three people lost their lives as a result of his recklessness, and countless friends and family members will experience the pain of their loss forever.”
A count of vehicular homicide in Florida can bring a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.
“He will no longer be able to damage and destroy the lives of Floridians and visitors. At the conclusion of his state charges, he will be deported,” Kerner said.
Newsweek reported that Singh is an Indian national and that the three people who died were a 37-year-old from Pompano Beach, 54-year-old from Miami, and the van driver, a 30-year-old from Florida City. The driver died at a hospital and the two others died at the scene.
Singh was arrested in California by U.S. Marshals on Saturday, Newsweek also reported.

DemasA former Michigan State University research assistant on Monday announced a lawsuit against the school, alleging that exposure to dangerous pesticides led to her being diagnosed with thyroid cancer. 
LingLong Wei was enrolled at MSU as a graduate student between 2008 and 2011, where she pursued a master’s degree in horticulture. According to her complaint, Wei was required, as part of her research, to spray “dangerous amounts of hazardous pesticides and herbicides, including but not limited to; paraquat, glyphosate, and oxyfluorfen.” 
One study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that out of 29 pesticides, 10 of them, including paraquat dichloride, glyphosate and oxyfluorfen, were associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While conducting research, Wei alleged she was not provided with personal protective equipment, nor were students offered proper training on pesticide application. 
The suit accuses MSU of violating countless safety protocols and governmental regulations, causing Wei serious injuries, namely a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma in 2024.
“Because of Michigan State University’s failures Ms. Wei required serious surgical intervention removing her thyroid and leaving a permanent disfigurement, namely a visible surgical scar,” the complaint reads. 
Defendants in the suit include the university, the board of trustees, the MSU College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, the Department of Horticulture, and the MSU Office of International Students and Scholars, with Wei studying at the university as an international student. 
Also named in the suit are Bernard Zandstra, a professor emeritus in the horticulture department, former Director of the Office for International Students and Scholars Peter Briggs and Rodney Tocco Jr. who served as a research manager for the university while Wei was attending MSU. 
Wei-Complaint
Wei has requested $100 million in damages accusing the university, Zandstra, Briggs and Tocco of gross negligence and all parties of negligent infliction of emotional distress. 
“Let’s be clear. MSU knew these were dangerous, toxic chemicals and they had the resources to protect Ms. Wei and her fellow student research assistants. But they chose not to,” said Maya Green, one of Wei’s attorneys “Once again MSU has proven that they care more about cashing their students’ tuition checks than keeping them safe.”
University spokesperson Amber McCann said the university cannot comment on pending litigation, but emphasized that MSU prioritizes the health and safety of its entire community.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he will no longer recommend that healthy children and pregnant people get COVID-19 shots. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.	

 
New Mexico continues to track its COVID-19 cases on a viral respiratory infections dashboard; residents can schedule COVID-19 vaccines on the state Department of Health vaccine website or by calling 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773).


Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.













The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council





The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 20:32:12+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT joins 20 states, DC suing DOJ to stop immigration requirements on victim funds",Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-sue-trump-crime-victims-immigration/,AGs from 20 states asked a judge to block DOJ conditions that would cut victim funding if states don't comply with immigration enforcement.,"A coalition of attorneys general from 20 states and Washington, D.C., is asking a federal judge to stop the U.S. Department of Justice from withholding federal funds earmarked for crime victims if states don’t cooperate with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts.
The lawsuit filed Monday in Rhode Island federal court seeks to block the Justice Department from enforcing conditions that would cut funding to a state or subgrantee if it refuses to honor civil immigration enforcement requests, denies U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers access to facilities or fails to provide advance notice of release dates of individuals possibly wanted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their immigration status.
The lawsuit asks that the conditions be thrown out, arguing that the administration and the agency are overstepping their constitutional and administrative authority.
The lawsuit also argues that the requirements are not permitted or outlined in the Victims of Crime Act, known as VOCA, and would interfere with policies created to ensure victims and witnesses report crimes without fear of deportation.
“These people did not ask for this status as a crime victim. They don’t breakdown neatly across partisan lines, but they share one common trait, which is that they’ve suffered an unimaginable trauma,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said during a video news conference Monday, calling the administration’s threat to withhold funds “the most heinous act” he’s seen in politics.
In an emailed statement, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong expressed similar sentiments toward victims of crime, while also taking issue with the conditions imposed by the Trump administration. 
“This is an insult to survivors and victims of crime, and to our police and prosectors on the front lines of real public safety,” Tong wrote. “Masked commandos who round up parents on their way to school, who storm court houses, who seize kids at summer jobs do not make us safer and will not secure our border. We will not waste state funds, personnel or time serving Trump’s reckless thuggery.”
Tong’s office said $14.5 million in federal funding to Connecticut was at stake. 
The federal conditions were placed on VOCA funding, which provides more than a billion dollars annually to states for victims compensation programs and grants that fund victims assistance organizations. VOCA funding comes entirely from fines and penalties in federal court cases, not from tax dollars.
Every state and territory has a victims compensation program that follows federal guidelines, but largely is set up under state law to provide financial help to crime victims, including medical expense reimbursement, paying for crime scene cleanup, counseling or helping with funeral costs for homicide victims. VOCA covers the cost of about 75% of state compensation program awards.
The funds are also used to pay for other services, including testing rape kits, funding grants to domestic violence recovery organizations, trauma recovery centers and more.
Advocates and others argue that the system needs to protect victims regardless of their immigration status and ensure that reporting a crime does not lead to deportation threats. They also say that marginalized communities, such as newly arrived immigrants, are more likely to be crime targets.
“The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who also joined the lawsuit, said in a statement Monday. “These grants were created to help survivors heal and recover, and we will fight to ensure they continue to serve that purpose … We will not be bullied into abandoning any of our residents.”
The Associated Press left a message seeking comment from a DOJ spokesperson Monday afternoon.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to withhold or pull back other federal funding or grant funding midstream, saying awardees and programs no longer agree with its priorities. In April, it canceled about $800 million in DOJ grants, some of which were awarded to victims service and survivor organizations.
And in June, states filed a lawsuit over added requirements in Violence Against Women Act funding that mandated applicants agree not to promote “gender ideology,” or run diversity, equity and inclusion programs or prioritize people in the country illegally.
Several attorneys general said the VOCA conditions appear to be another way the administration is targeting so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, though there is no clear definition of what a sanctuary state or city is.
The Trump administration earlier this month released an updated list of states, cities and counties it considers sanctuary jurisdictions. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the August announcement that the department would “continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”
As of Monday afternoon attorneys general from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin — all Democrats — had signed on to the lawsuit.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photos by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)In Virginia’s governor’s race, the candidates aren’t just preparing to debate — they’ve been debating whether to debate.
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger announced Monday that she has accepted a debate set for Oct. 9, hosted by Norfolk State University and WAVY-TV. 
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the Republican nominee, had already agreed last Friday, according to a press release that her campaign said it had shared with reporters, but that The Mercury did not receive at the time.
“Spanberger hasn’t debated since she first ran for Congress,” the release said.
After flipping a previously-Republican-held district in 2018, Spanberger defended the seat for two more terms. She withdrew from a planned debate against challenger Yesli Vega in 2022 over security concerns and disagreements about the moderator. 
During the 2025 election cycle for governor, both Spanberger and Earle-Sears have passed on some debate opportunities. 
Last week, Earle-Sears declined to participate in the “People’s Debate,” which would have been hosted at Virginia State University with AARP Virginia and WTVR-TV, citing a scheduling conflict. 
While Spanberger had agreed to that forum, her campaign declined a CNN-hosted debate,  saying that any debates should be carried by state and local media — the outlets a governor would work with most often. 
“We believe that debates about Virginia’s future should be rooted in Virginia, produced by Virginia media, and accessible to Virginians across the commonwealth,” her campaign manager told CNN recently. 
Peyton Vogel, a spokesperson for Earle-Sears emphasized in a text message to The Mercury Monday that her campaign had agreed to the Norfolk debate first,  sharing a screenshot of last week’s announcement. 
Meanwhile, Spanberger’s Monday statement declared that she “is ready to debate the issues.”
Political analyst Bob Holsworth said it’s not surprising to see candidates and their consultants showing “less interest in debates, because these are events where they don’t control the narrative.” 
Holsworth added he was surprised Earle-Sears, who has trailed Spanberger in fundraising and polling so far this year, didn’t demand debates earlier in the campaign and remained silent when her running-mate, John Reid, pressed Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Ghazala Hashmi to debate. 
On Spanberger’s moves, he said she “adopted a conventional front runner strategy” by limiting the amount of debates and choosing the venues. 
By avoiding the CNN debate, she was also able to sidestep nationally focused moderators asking her about Democrats such as U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, and Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City — two progressive members of their party that more moderate Democrats have had to contend with. 
Both candidates have accused the other of being “too extreme” for Virginia. But on Oct. 9, they will have a chance to lay out competing visions for the state and challenge each other’s ideas. While both women have highlighted plans to strengthen Virginia’s economy, their party affiliations point to sharp differences in approach. 
The stakes this year extend beyond the governor’s race. The lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 seats in the House of Delegates are also on the ballot. Whether Democrats hold their majority in the legislature could determine the future of a proposed constitutional amendment to protect reproductive rights in Virginia. 
While bipartisan support has advanced measures to restore voting rights to ex-felons who’ve completed their sentences and to protect same-sex marriage, the reproductive rights amendment only cleared the legislature because Democrats are in control. If lawmakers pass it again next year, voters would decide its fate at the ballot box. 
As for which woman might become Virginia’s top executive next year, Holsworth said ultimately voters may better know them through commercials and social media than through debates — where candidates face tough questions in high-stakes settings. 
“This is increasingly the way of contemporary campaigns, and it’s not surprising that the public is frustrated with this trend,” he said.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks is launching a conservation project next week to protect and expand a recently discovered population of native westslope cutthroat trout in the headwaters of a Madison River tributary.
Elk Creek stretches more than a dozen miles into the foothills southwest of Gallatin Valley. In upper reaches near the creek’s headwaters, a small population of native westslope cutthroat trout population lives in a stretch of river of approximately 0.8 miles.
The project aims to restore cutthroats to roughly eight miles of stream by removing nonnative brook trout during the next year.
“This project will help ensure the survival and continued genetic diversity of native westslope cutthroat trout in this Madison River tributary,” Jenna Sirmon, FWP’s lead fisheries staff member on the Elk Creek efforts, said in a press release.
The species of trout is listed as a “species of special concern” by the state of Montana. Westslope cutthroat historically occupied more than 1,461 miles of tributary streams and rivers in the Madison River basin, according to FWP, but today there are only 22 populations in small headwater tributaries — covering just 14% of their historic range.
Westslope cutthroat have declined due to competition and hybridization with non-native fish, such as brook trout. The small population in Elk Creek has been threatened from the introduction of brook trout downstream from an FWP fishery.
According to FWP’s Westslope Cutthroat Trout Conservation Strategy for the Missouri River Headwaters of Southwest Montana, the long-term goal for WCT conservation is to restore protected conservation populations of WCT to 20% of their historic tributary distribution east of the Continental Divide.
Under the restoration project’s decision notice, released this spring, FWP personnel will remove brook trout located upstream of a constructed fish barrier using rotenone, a plant-derived fish toxin. The treatment, lasting 3-5 days, will be repeated within a year, after which environmental DNA sampling will verify whether all nonnative fish in the stream were successfully removed. If so, the isolated population of westslope cutthroat, which will be collected by fisheries staff prior to treatment, would be returned to the stream and able to occupy roughly eight miles of stream.
According to the environmental assessment of the project, rotenone inhibits oxygen transfer at the cellular level and is effective on fish due to its rapid absorption into the blood stream through the gills. The treatment is not known to pose a threat to terrestrial and avian animals that consume treated waters or dead fish.
After treatment, cutthroat in Elk Creek would be monitored during the next  five to 10 years to document their expansion in the drainage. Experience from other projects indicates that salvaged WCT released back to the stream following non-native trout removals will fill the available habitat within three to six years, according to FWP.
Downstream of the fish barrier on Elk Creek, FWP will continue to manage nonnative species, such as brook trout.
“We also recognize the value of nonnative species to anglers, and FWP will continue to manage most tributaries in the Missouri headwaters for nonnative fish for recreation opportunities,” Mike Duncan, FWP’s fisheries program manager in southwestern Montana, said in a press release.
FWP fisheries staff are scheduled to begin removing brook trout from the project area in Elk Creek the week of Aug. 25. This year’s phase of the project is expected to last about a week. An additional treatment phase of the project will happen in 2026, and subsequent stream sampling will help ensure the project’s success.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/23802588448_8b864c7ac6_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 16:57:40.921951

(Documents and text message from U.S. District Court files)  A Des Moines events disc jockey who responded to a competitor’s legal claims with a string of contentious messages saying the company’s product “sucks” is now being sued for trademark infringement.
Brian Junge of Des Moines Karaoke & DJ Service is being sued by DJ Trivia, a Georgia company, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
DJ Trivia offers a variety of entertainment services, including disc jockey music, bingo, and trivia services to consumers in taverns and other venues throughout the United States. The company claims it has had a registered trademark on the terms “DJ Trivia” and “DJ Bingo” since 2017.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In 2023, an affiliate of DJ Trivia allegedly contacted Junge regarding DJ Trivia’s rights regarding the term “DJ Bingo,” asking that Junge stop using that term in connection with his business. According to exhibits and attachments to the lawsuit, Junge responded with a text message indicating he had added the word “video” to his use of the term to avoid any conflict.
Junge wrote: “Listen you stupid childish little boy. The work (sic) videos been added to shut your dumb ass up. Stupid parent company franchise from is not going to be able to enforce DJ Bingo as a trademark. That’s the dumbest bunch of s— I’ve ever heard… It’s not wise to create enemies. Why you got to start stupid s—…”
Since then, the lawsuit claims, Junge has continued to use the terms “Video DJ Trivia” and “Video DJ Bingo,” “VJ Trivia,” and “VJ Bingo,” which the Georgia company argues are “confusingly similar” to its trademarks.
On June 6, 2025, a lawyer for DJ Trivia allegedly sent Junge a formal cease-and-desist letter, objecting to his use of the terminology.
Court records include a copy of a June 8, 2025, letter that purports to be Junge’s response to the demand. The letter states in part: “Are you ignorance? we don’t sell our product as DJ trivia. it’s a VJ with a v, as in music video trivia. it’s not even close to the same product that you guys offer which sucks by the way. Go ahead and do what you think you got to do but the fact of the matter is we do not call it DJ bingo at all …  you guys aren’t even providing the same caliber of services let alone do you have a claim against what we’re doing. you are ridiculous and need to get a freaking life.”
The lawsuit alleges trademark infringement and unfair competition and seeks an award of up to three times any actual damages, as well as all of the profits realized by of Des Moines DJ & Karaoke Service through its wrongful acts, plus punitive and exemplary damages due to the Des Moines’ company’s “willful” conduct.
Junge said he had yet to see a copy of the lawsuit and added that he never received the June 6 letter that DJ Trivia claims triggered a response from Junge two days later.
He said he had only received “random” weekend text messages from someone claiming to be an attorney and objecting to the use of his terminology in advertisements and promotions.
“I thought it was a joke to be honest with you,” he said. “We never got any kind of notice or any service of any kind of documentation purporting that they supposedly had a trademark.”
Junge added that he believes the addition of the word “video” to his product names nullifies any claims of infringement. “If your trademark is ‘DJ Bingo,’ that’s not ‘VJ Bingo,’ and ‘VJ’ represents something different than ‘DJ,’” he said. “It’s not the same thing.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In August of every year, WalletHub publishes their update of the “Best & Worst States for Women’s Equality.” Each year, when I’m asked by the media if this is a surprise, I explain that it is not as we have studied the data for many years at the Utah Women & Leadership Project. In fact, in 2021 we published an extensive analysis of Wallet’s metrics titled “ Women’s Equality in Utah: Why Utah Is Ranked as the Worst State, and What Can Be Done.
Now, for 11 years running, Utah has ranked as the worst state when it comes to women’s equality. And, in WalletHub’s 2025 findings just released, we are not only ranked as the 50th of 50 states yet again, but there is a substantial gap between us the next worst state, Texas, with Idaho, Arkansa, and Louisiana  near the bottom too, but with about 12 points or more (of 100) more than Utah.
As I walk you through the results, it is important to note that the data sources WalletHub uses—for example, the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, CDC—are typically a couple of years behind. However, I do expect that with so many organizations and individuals joining forces with A Bolder Way Forward launched in June of 2023, we’ll be making progress soon.  It is also important to note that these are specific metrics chosen by WalletHub and experts, but they do not represent the full scope of metrics that could be possible (including some positive ones).
Basically, WalletHub groups their findings into three main categories (workplace environment, education and health, and political empowerment) with 17 key indicators that are each weighted differently. With a total of 100 points, Utah had 29.85 points in 2021, 31.22 points in 2022, 19.43 points in 2023, 23.04 in 2024, and 29.93 in 2025. In 2021, we were 7.52 points behind Idaho, while in 2022 we were 12.77 points behind Georgia, and in 2023 Utah was 22.11 points behind Texas. In 2024, we were 16.71 points behind Texas, and now in 2025 we are 11.96 points behind Texas.
I was able to get more in-depth data from WalletHub than was published in their recent report.
Let me share what I found.
Workplace environment
Utah currently ranks 50th for the “Workplace Environment” category (we were 44th in 2021, 48th in 2022, 49th in 2023, and 50th in 2024 ), which is worth 40 of the 100 points. I have not included the actual points for each, but instead their rankings (1=Best State; 50=Worst State) for 2022, 2023, 2024, and now 2025.

Income Disparity: 2022=50, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=49
Higher-Income Disparity: 2022=49, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=50
Disparity in Share of Executive Positions: 2022=46, 2023=48, 2024=48, 2025=47
Disparity in Share of Minimum-Wage Workers: 2022=1, 2023=1, 2024=1, 2025=1
Unemployment-Rate Disparity: 2022=1, 2023=34; 2024=43, 2025=49
Entrepreneurship-Rate Disparity: 2022=43, 2023=49, 2024=34, 2025=41
Disparity in Average Number of Work Hours: 2022=50, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=50
Job Security Disparity: 2022=29, 2023=1, 2024=50, 2025=1
Economic Security Disparity: 2022=3, 2023=3, 2024=3, 2025=3
Disparity in Poverty Rate: 2022=6, 2023=4, 2024=5, 2025=3

The most concerning areas for me include income disparity (gender pay gap), higher-income disparity, and executive position disparity. It is important to remember that our rankings go down when other states make progress.
Education and health
Utah ranks 50th in “Education & Health” (40 points), which was where we were ranked for many years. This category is the sum of the following three key indicators.

Disparity in Advanced Educational Attainment: 2022=50, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=50
Disparity in Math Test Scores: 2022=43, 2023=50, 2024=50, 2025=33
Disparity in Doctor-Visit Affordability: 2022=33, 2023=45, 2024=37, 2025=41

Although I’m concerned about all of these, I am hoping the progress seen in the disparity in math test scores in 8th grade is not just a blip. This still means, however, that girls are significantly lower (when compared to boys) on math scores, particularly when compared to other states.
Political empowerment
And finally, Utah now ranks 28th on the “Political Empowerment” category (20 points), which I was expecting because of a few increases. We were 42nd in 2022, 49th in 2023, and 41st in 2024):

Disparity in Share of Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate: 2022=21, 2023=22, 2024=22, 2025=22 (all states with no women are ranked at 22)
Disparity in Share of Lawmakers in U.S. House of Representatives: 2022=37, 2023=37, 2024=23, 2025=23 (this increased last year with Celeste Malloy in office; all states with no women are ranked at 37 last year at least)
Disparity in Share of Lawmakers in State Legislature: 2022=37, 2023=40, 2024=39, 2025=32
Disparity in Share of State-Elected Executives: 2022=30; 2023=36, 2024=38, 2025=15 (in 2025, Tina Cannon as now serving as state auditor, along with Deidre Henderson as lieutent governor)

Research continues to show that women in political office are more likely to advocate for public policies around education, health, poverty, and family issues. As I’ve said many times, things change when there are more equal percentages of men and women serving in elected office at all levels.
Understanding where we are in a variety of metrics and ranking is the key to targeted, strategic improvements. Although rankings are not the end-all and don’t highlight some of the positive things women in Utah achieve, they are aligned with the extensive research on girls and women conducted and tracked by the Utah Women & Leadership Project and our partners. Importantly, improving things for girls and women doesn’t mean that we are lifting them at the expense of boys and men—that is the scarcity mentality. We believe that there is enough for everyone through cooperation and collaboration, which is the abundance mentality. We welcome all Utahns to be involved in changing things in Utah girls, women, and families!",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012624_Senate_03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 16:57:40.921951

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”
 42,000 RI crime victims compensated in FY24

But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.
If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 ‘The most heinous acts’

“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.
Other state AGs that joined represent Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Dan McKee has one day left to answer U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi’s demands that Rhode Island eliminate all policies that stand in the way of the Trump administration’s immigration agenda or else potentially lose federal funding because of its status as a “sanctuary jurisdiction.”
“You are hereby notified that your jurisdiction has been identified as one that engages in sanctuary policies and practices that thwart federal immigration enforcement to the detriment of the interests of the United States,” Bondi wrote in an Aug. 13 letter to the governor. “This ends now.”
The letter to McKee, first reported by WPRI-12 Friday, was sent a little over a week after the U.S. Department of Justice published a list identifying 19 cities, four counties and 12 states as engaging in “sanctuary policies and practices.”
Bondi’s letter gives McKee until Tuesday to issue a response that confirms its “commitment to complying with federal law,” but the governor has no plans to do so.
“This generic, non-specific form letter lacks any meaningful detail and does not merit a response,” McKee said in a statement.
McKee’s decision to stand firm against the Trump administration’s immigration policy was lauded by the head of the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
“The DOJ letter is really just a hamhanded attempt to intimidate jurisdictions that are refusing to march in step with the Trump administration’s really cruel deportation machine,” Steven Brown, executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in an interview Monday.
That list was part of an executive order issued by President Donald Trump April 28 mandating federal officials identify and publicly highlight jurisdictions that “refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.”
Rhode Island, as well as the cities of Providence and Central Falls, was included on another, much longer sanctuary jurisdiction list shared by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in May. It was later taken down after some counties and the National Sheriffs’ Association disagreed with their inclusion.
Providence and Central Falls were not included on the DOJ’s new list. A department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why the two municipalities were not included.
According to the Justice Department’s letter, Rhode Island’s designation as a “sanctuary jurisdiction” is based on a review of the state’s laws, policies, and practices. The department’s website further outlines the characteristics of this designation, including: public declarations of sanctuary status; local laws or rules limiting cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and restrictions on information about “immigration status of detainees with federal authorities,” among others.
Rhode Island Current reached out to the DOJ for specific details and received a referral back to the department’s website. 
Brown suggested limits on ICE detainers, which Rhode Island only allows for no more than 48 hours under a 2014 federal court order, as one possible reason.
“That order found that acting otherwise would violate the Constitution,” Brown said. “They’re complaining that Rhode Island is complying with the Fourth Amendment.”
But Bondi wrote that sanctuary jurisdictions give “aliens cover to perpetrate crimes in our communities and evade the immigration consequences that federal law requires.” She added that officials who continue to obstruct the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts may be subject to criminal charges.
It’s a challenge Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, who was copied on the Aug. 13 letter, welcomed.
“The only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Neronha said in a statement. “If the Trump Administration takes issue with this, then the doors of federal court are open to them. Until that point, my focus is elsewhere.”

States have until Sept. 10 to resubmit plans for spending their share of federal money set aside by Congress during the Biden administration to put more fast-charging stations along the interstate system for electric vehicles. South Carolina’s designated share of the $5 billion total is nearly $70 million.
The state Department of Transportation is revising its plan and will meet next month’s deadline, spokeswoman Hannah Robinson told the SC Daily Gazette.
In a state that’s lured billions of dollars’ worth of investment from electric vehicle manufacturers, the availability of electric vehicle charging stations lags most of the country.
In February, after President Donald Trump took office, the Federal Highway Administration stopped sending out dollars for the effort known as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program.
The highway agency allowed states to keep money for any charging station sites already under contract for construction. But the agency halted all funds not designated for a project with an eye toward clawing back the money and ending the program altogether.
At the time, South Carolina was still drafting documents and had yet to solicit bids, award contracts or spend any money on chargers.
Twenty states, the District of Columbia and half a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the paused funding. The money remained on ice until a federal judge, in June, ordered the freeze be lifted.
Last week, the highway agency sent notices out to states, letting them know they could reapply.
‘Do it right’
In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy criticized the Biden administration for its slow rollout of the program. Both NEVI and its sister program, the $2.5 billion Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant, were plagued by delays.
Though the Biden administration had approved states’ plans, many had spent just a fraction of their funds.
“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Duffy said in a statement. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress’ will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”
There are 87 NEVI-funded stations open across 16 states, according to an online dashboard maintained by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the National Association of State Energy Officials. States have awarded contracts on more than 200 stations that have yet to be built. Contracts for 160 other stations were paused.
Duffy, in his statement, went on to say the highway agency’s new guidance “slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure.”
What changed
The original program required charging stations to be located every 50 miles along corridors. The new guidance did away with that distance requirement, leaving it up to states to decide.
In line with the Trump administration’s pushback on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts, the highway agency also erased language around soliciting “diverse” feedback, including from rural and underserved communities, and ensuring an “equitable” distribution of chargers. It also cut requirements that 40% of funds pay for projects benefiting disadvantaged communities.
Gone also are requirements that states give added consideration to small, minority and woman-owned contractors.
And the agency no longer suggests states consider renewable energy sources to power the stations, which can charge up to four vehicles at the same time.
States can simply resubmit their same plans for reapproval. The highway agency just won’t take the removed standards into consideration when evaluating it.
Similar to the Biden administration’s original rules, once states have a reliable fleet of fast chargers along its designated interstates, they can spend any leftover funding on installing chargers along state and local roads.
SC lags behind
South Carolina remains 31st in the nation and next to last in the Southeast when it comes to the number of fast chargers per capita, according to the most recent report issued by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.
The state also trails in the number of electric vehicles sold.
South Carolina has about 1,640 public charging ports at just over 600 locations, according to the U.S. Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, compared to 10,500 in Florida, 5,435 in Georgia and 4,575 in North Carolina.
In the Southeast, only Alabama has fewer ports — 1,043.
It’s unclear how many charging stations South Carolina could add with the money.
Georgia has spent about $180,000 per charging port, awarding contracts for 20 stations, according to the online database. Alabama expects to add 60 charging stations with the federal grant, while North Carolina plans to add 40. Both states expect to spend about $150,000 per port.
Other federal funding
While the funding for electric vehicle chargers is restored, other climate change-related federal grant money remains out of reach.
Last year, South Carolina’s Office of Resilience won a $124 million Environmental Protection Agency grant for solar programs to help low-income communities. That funding was part of $7 billion awarded nationwide for the so-called Solar for All component of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
The state had planned to spend the money in four ways:

Money for low-income families that wanted to pool their resources and install off-site solar panels to power multiple homes
Money for low-income households to make their homes more energy efficient and save on their monthly power bill, building on programs already offered by utility companies in the state
Workforce development programs to train more people to work in the solar industry
An innovation fund that affordable housing builders could tap to add solar power to their developments, giving tenants access to low-cost energy

The state Office of Resilience was still in its first year of planning when the funding was pulled, so the agency had yet to work out any further details.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/electric-car-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 15:57:23.171365

(Photo courtesy of Express Scripts press materials)West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey announced Monday that the state is following the lead of several other states in suing pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts for its role in exacerbating the ongoing drug and overdose epidemic.
McCuskey said Express Scripts, now known as Evernorth Health, ignored widely known information showing the danger of opioid abuse in order to “prioritize profits over compliance and public safety.” 
In doing so, according to the lawsuit, Express Scripts “violated its legal duties under West Virginia law, contributing directly to the oversupply of opioids and the deepening of opioid use disorder across the state.”
McCuskey first announced the new suit in an interview with MetroNews Talkline, then again in a news conference Monday morning.
The state’s suit is at least the fourth to be filed nationally against Express Scripts for what state attorneys general are alleging is its role in fueling the nation’s drug epidemic. 
Kentucky filed a similar suit last September, Utah did so in December and Michigan filed suit against the company and its subsidiaries in April. 
In the West Virginia suit, attorneys wrote that Express Scripts’ — in its role as a pharmacy benefit manager — held a “uniquely powerful position” within the “prescription drug ecosystem.”
Pharmacy benefit managers often act as intermediaries between insurance providers, drug manufacturers and pharmacies, negotiating discounts and rebates with manufacturers and reimbursing pharmacies for the prescriptions they fill on behalf of the insurance company.
This specific positioning, McCuskey said, made Express Scripts a “central architect” for the opioid epidemic while it ignored data readily available about the harms of widespread prescribing and use of addictive opioids.
“The opioid crisis is a direct result of greed and evil. Opioid manufacturers have been held accountable, now it’s time for others who illegally profited behind the scenes to pay the price,” McCuskey said. “[Pharmacy benefit managers], like Express Scripts … had every tool at their disposal to alert them to how addictive and destructive opioids are. Instead, for decades they ignored their own data, broke state and federal laws and put profits over people’s lives.”
Specifically, according to the lawsuit, Express Scripts violated West Virginia state law by:

Conspiring with opioid manufacturers to “deceptively market” opioids to the public, leading to misconceptions about their safety and the risk of addiction.
Incentivizing increased sale and prescription of opioids through using “substantial rebates and fees,” which “undermine[d] clinical judgement.”
“Eliminating and weakening” certain protocols meant to prevent the overprescription of pills, like prior authorizations and quantity limits on the amount of opioids prescribed.
Ignoring “overwhelming” data — from both inside and outside the company — showing evidence of the widespread risk of opioid abuse tied to overprescription of the drugs.
Dispensing opioids through “mail-order pharmacies,” which lacked “adequate controls or oversight” to prevent overprescription.

Though Express Scripts is a different kind of entity than an opioid manufacturer or distributor, the points laid out in West Virginia’s suit alleging its role in fueling the opioid epidemic are akin to those made in similar cases.
The suit says that while the company now “points to remedial measures” it took that were adopted “under public scrutiny” due to the devastation of the opioid epidemic, those measures aren’t enough to make up for the harm done.
“[Express Scripts] prioritized profit over compliance, safety and the health interests of the state,” the suit reads. “Rather than using its data analytics capabilities to identify and mitigate the harms of excessive opioid distribution, Express Scripts sold these services to opioid manufacturers, enabling the manufacturers to refine their false, deceptive and misleading marketing strategies to increase opioid sales within [West Virginia].”
McCuskey, talking to MetroNews on Monday, said the goal of the suit is to attempt to recoup at least some of the financial loss West Virginia experienced due to the epidemic. Complicating the manner, McCuskey continued, is that the price paid by West Virginians is much more than just financial.
“Ultimately, what we’re asking for is money. And you know, in this world, accountability is achieved through financial transactions, and the amount of damage that has been done to the people of West Virginia isn’t monetizable,” McCuskey said. “… This is generational damage that not only cost the state outrageous amounts of money, but cost us so much more in ways that are very, very difficult to quantify.”

(Screenshot from Iowa PBS livestream)Iowa Rep. J.D. Scholten ended his campaign for U.S. Senate Monday, endorsing his Iowa House colleague Rep. Josh Turek to become the Democratic nominee in 2026.
Scholten, a Sioux City Democrat, entered the race in June after U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst had responded at a town hall to critics of Medicaid cuts included in the GOP budget reconciliation law with “well, we are all going to die.” In a statement Monday, Scholten said he believed the conversation on Medicaid cuts included in the “big, beautiful” law would be crucial in 2026.
“There are still so many issues facing Iowans today but we can’t sit by while healthcare is ripped from millions of Americans,” Scholten said. “And there is no better Democrat in Iowa to talk about healthcare issues than my friend: State Rep. Josh Turek.”
Turek, a Democrat from Council Bluffs, launched his campaign on Tuesday. The two-time Paralympic gold medalist said his family relied on public assistance programs like Medicaid, as well as Iowa’s Area Education Agencies and free summer lunch program as he was growing up, having gone through 21 surgeries by age 12 for spina bifida.
Scholten, a professional baseball pitcher for the minor league Sioux City Explorers, said he and Turek share many similarities as athletes representing western Iowa at the Statehouse.
“From the very beginning, I thought a prairie populist athlete from Western Iowa would be the best candidate to win in the General election,” Scholten said in a statement. “I still do, but instead of me, I have complete confidence that Josh Turek can take this on. That’s why I am suspending my campaign and endorsing him. As his friend, I’m proud to support him.”
Turek said he was “honored” to have Scholten’s support in the race.
“Over the last several years, J.D. and I have fought alongside one another in the state legislature to lower costs for Iowa’s families, to make health care more affordable and accessible, to make housing more affordable, and to make life a little bit easier and a little bit better for Iowa’s families,” Turek said. “We have an incredible opportunity to beat Joni Ernst in 2026, and I’m proud to join forces with J.D.”
Ernst has not officially said if she plans to run for reelection in 2026, though she has told reporters an announcement would be “coming soon.” She also told a GOP audience last week that Democrats can “bring it on” in the 2026 election.
Though Scholten is no longer in the race, there is still a large field of Democrats competing to become the nominee. Iowa Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, Des Moines School Board Chair Jackie Norris and Nathan Sage, former Knoxville Chamber of Commerce director, are running for the seat, alongside Turek. Two Republicans, Jim Carlin, a former state lawmaker and Joshua Smith, who has run as a Libertarian candidate in previous elections, are also campaigning for the GOP nomination.
Turek and Scholten will hold an event in Council Bluffs Monday evening. Wahls is also campaigning Monday, touring a Cedar Rapids ironworking apprenticeship program and announcing an endorsement Monday afternoon.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jd-scholten.jpg,,,2025-08-18 15:57:23.171365

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

“It has changed for the worse,” said one attendee at recent memorials for the late Gov. Tom Salmon and a top aide to Democratic successors Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean.

When the children of the late Vermont Gov. Tom Salmon thought about scheduling a remembrance for their father after the 92-year-old died in January, all knew why they had to wait until August.
Salmon was a Rockingham lawyer in the summer of 1972 when, seeing Democrats without a gubernatorial candidate, he announced a last-minute, long-shot bid on the afternoon of the Aug. 2 filing deadline.
“I run at a time when the public’s confidence in its governmental leaders, at many levels, is at an all-time low, when there is a deep feeling among all segments of the people that things aren’t working,” Salmon said in a speech quoted by state newspapers just starting to print stories about the Watergate scandal. “I run to give our people a choice between the policies of the past and the promise of the future.”
Three months later, Salmon miraculously beat favored Republican businessman Luther “Fred” Hackett in what the Burlington Free Press, then the state’s largest newspaper, deemed “the biggest political upset in Vermont history.”
“We celebrate not a victory of party but a victory for the indomitable and independent people of the state of Vermont,” Salmon told reporters on that Nov. 7, 1972, election night. “Democracy is alive and well.”
A half-century later, family and friends gathered Saturday to remember that past “promise of the future” amid a nationally turbulent present.
“It’s a bit of a rough patch right now — the issues have become more complex and more partisan,” said state Treasurer Mike Pieciak, a 42-year-old who first met Salmon shortly after serving as a student legislative page. “It has become meaner and focused on how are you going to beat the other side.”

The event was one of two recent memorials that featured a Who’s Who of colleagues of the late governor and his two Democratic successors, Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean.
Salmon’s funeral at Bellows Falls’ St. Charles Parish and follow-up reception at the local country club drew people of all ages and political stripes. They included current Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who ordered the lowering of flags over the weekend in honor of his predecessor, who served from 1973 to 1977.
“Governor Salmon led Vermont through some of our nation’s most difficult times, doing his best to stabilize our economy and strengthen trust of government,” Scott said in a statement. “His efforts on behalf of Vermont are worthy of our gratitude, remembrance and respect.”
In July, dozens more gathered at the Upper Valley’s Hanover Inn to honor the late Kathy Hoyt, an 83-year-old Norwich resident who died in March after a Vermont political career that spanned three gubernatorial administrations.
“She believed in government,” Hoyt’s son Michael said in a speech. “She believed in a society that helps people and works for them, that allows them to achieve their potential.”
Attendees noted a slew of recent headlines about federal cuts to everything from Vermont food assistance to flood mitigation. In contrast, they recalled when state news once centered on Salmon’s work to protect the environment (such as his land gains tax to control subdivisions), Kunin’s efforts to boost education (ensuring all students access to kindergarten) and Dean’s push to expand health care (starting with the Dr. Dynasaur program for children).

Hoyt worked as planning director for the Vermont Agency of Human Services under Salmon, then served as Kunin’s chief of staff after the state’s first, and so far only, female governor won election in 1984.
“It was an exciting time,” Kunin said in a speech. “Women were coming into their own. We were on sort of an adventure, not knowing exactly where it would lead.”
Kunin stepped down in January 1991, only for her successor, Republican Richard Snelling, to die of cardiac arrest that August. Dean, then lieutenant governor, was no sooner sworn in as Snelling’s replacement when he asked Hoyt to serve as his chief of staff and, later, the first female secretary of administration until his departure in 2002.
“The thing that amazed me about Kathy was her integrity and her willingness to always try to do the right thing,” Dean said in a speech, “including a few times when she had to convince me to do the right thing when I was not inclined to do so.”
Attendees at both memorials said such motivation was often lacking today.
“I think in a lot of ways it has changed for the worse,” said Pieciak, noting he was talking more about the national scene. “It’s much more about personal ego, wealth, success, attention, and not about the people. I wonder if I was 10 years younger, would I ever have gotten into politics? Does the politics that I became interested in still exist?”
Pieciak added of speculation about a future run for governor: “It’s too early to talk.”
Kunin voiced similar concerns about the changing tenor.
“In those days, public administration and public action were applauded and revered,” she said. “We live in a time now where the best and the brightest might not serve because you’re demonized if you take that step.”
Attendees at both memorials questioned the best way to respond. Michael Hoyt shared what he thought his mother would say: “She’d tell you, ‘Don’t despair, don’t give up.’ She’d say, ‘It’s always darkest before the dawn.’”
Kunin, set to celebrate her 92nd birthday in September, offered her own answer when asked, “How are you?”
“I’m here,” she said. “You have to hang in there.”

Long testified in February before a Kentucky House committee against a Republican-sponsored bill that would cancel Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s 2024 executive order that banned a controversial practice known as “conversion therapy” for minors.
Conversion therapy is a catchall term for controversial efforts to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ+ people. Sometimes called “reparative therapy,” it can range from talk therapy and religious counseling to electrical shocks, pain-inducing aversion therapy and physical isolation.
The bill, Long told lawmakers, “creates a legal shield for conversion therapy, allowing parents to force their children into a practice condemned by every major medical and mental health organization worldwide.”
Kentucky’s Republican-controlled legislature passed the bill, then overrode the governor’s veto in March.
Conversion therapy has been denounced by major medical organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association, American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. They say it’s ineffective and harmful and puts LGBTQ+ people at risk for depression, substance use, suicide and other mental health issues.
More than half of states have banned or restricted the practice for underage patients since California became the first to do so in 2012, according to the Movement Advancement Project, a nonprofit research organization that tracks LGBTQ+-related laws and policies.
But political currents are shifting. Conservative majorities in the courts, in state legislatures and at the federal level have reshaped the legal landscape, opening the door for Republican lawmakers and conservative Christian groups to reinstate a practice that has been roundly discredited by the medical community.

In March, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging Colorado’s 2019 conversion therapy ban on freedom of speech grounds. The decision marks a change from 2017, when the court refused to hear a challenge to California’s ban, and 2023, when it declined to hear a challenge to Washington’s ban.
The high court’s decision, which isn’t expected until next year, could reverse — or solidify — conversion therapy bans across the country.
Last month, a Virginia court partially struck down the state’s 2020 law banning conversion therapy for minors, a win for conservative Christian organizations. GOP lawmakers in Michigan have introduced a bill to repeal the state’s ban. And Missouri‘s Republican attorney general has filed suit to overturn local conversion therapy bans.
On the flip side, in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court cleared the way earlier this year for the state to permanently ban the practice.
‘The world has changed’
While organized attempts to “cure” homosexuality have been around for centuries, “ex-gay” groups that promised to change a person’s sexual orientation began gaining ground in the 1990s as policy debates arose over same-sex marriage and gay people serving in the military, said Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in private practice in New York City. He is also a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University whose research has focused on gender and sexuality.
But after Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage in 2004 and more states followed, the influence of conversion therapy proponents waned.
As of this year, 23 states and Washington, D.C., prevent licensed health care providers from subjecting minors to conversion therapy, according to an analysis of state laws by the Movement Advancement Project. Four more states restrict the practice, such as by not allowing public funding to go toward conversion therapy services.

State laws typically levy fines or discipline the professional licenses of practitioners who try to engage minors in conversion therapy. They don’t necessarily prevent clergy or unlicensed counselors from attempting such counseling.
The bans are more of a public statement of acceptance of LGBTQ+ people, rather than a commonly used preventive measure, said Drescher.
“The bans are reinforcements of the belief that if homosexuality is not a mental disorder or disease, there’s no reason to pretend you can treat it, and anybody who tries is acting outside the mainstream of science,” Drescher told Stateline.
The American Medical Association has written model legislation for state lawmakers who want to ban conversion therapy, a reflection of the broad consensus in the medical community that homosexuality and gender nonconformity are not mental illnesses, said R.J. Mills, a representative from the American Medical Association, in a statement to Stateline.
In the past, some leading psychiatric and psychological associations were hesitant to support state restrictions because they saw the laws as intrusions into the doctor-patient or therapist-patient relationship, Drescher said.










Everybody understands what’s at stake now.


– Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in New York City whose research focuses on gender and sexuality


Now, spurred by Trump administration policies that place new restrictions on LGBTQ+ people and the most conservative U.S. Supreme Court in generations, medical organizations are growing more vocal in their opposition to conversion therapy.
“The world has changed,” Drescher said. “Everybody understands what’s at stake now.”
Free speech argument
Conservative legal firms have filed lawsuits in states such as Colorado, Michigan and Virginia on behalf of Christian counselors who say the laws prevent them from practicing according to their faith-based values. They say the bans should be repealed so practitioners won’t face losing their careers over providing services informed by their faith.
A Virginia court last month oversaw a consent decree in which Virginia agreed to not fully enforce its 2020 conversion therapy ban and to allow counselors to engage in talk conversion therapy with minors. The plaintiffs in the case were John and Janet Raymond, state-licensed professional counselors in Virginia who were represented by the Founding Freedoms Law Center, an organization that takes on conservative legal causes.
The kind of talk therapy now allowed can involve conversation, prayer and sharing of written materials such as religious scriptures, said Josh Hetzler, the Raymonds’ attorney, during a public news conference following the court decision.
“With this court order, every counselor in Virginia will now be able to speak freely, truthfully and candidly with clients who are seeking to have those critical conversations about their identity, and to hear faith-based insights from trusted professionals,” he said.
Conservative legislators also are citing their Christian faith in their attempts to roll back state bans.
Michigan state Rep. Josh Schriver, a Republican, filed a package of bills last month aimed at repealing a handful of what he calls “anti-Christ laws,” including Michigan’s 2023 ban on conversion therapy for youth.

A legislative aide said Schriver wasn’t available for an interview, and instead referred Stateline to the recent Substack post he emailed to his constituents.
“As legislators, we’re duty-bound to remove statutes that overstep the authority given by our state and federal Constitutions,” Schriver said in the post.
Long, the Kentucky minister, said the bans are needed because “no one enters conversion therapy willingly.”
“The only reason a child would go through it is because a trusted authority in their life — a parent, a pastor or a therapist — has told them that they are broken and need to be fixed.”
At least five states have a law or policy prohibiting or deterring local-level ordinances that aim to protect youth from conversion therapy.
Some states without such laws are going after municipalities that have banned conversion therapy.
Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey in February sued Jackson County, Missouri, home to Kansas City, challenging the county’s 2023 ordinance and Kansas City’s 2019 ordinance, both of which ban licensed counselors from engaging in conversion therapy with minors.
“Our children have a right to therapy that allows for honest, unrestricted conversations, free from transgender indoctrination,” Bailey said in a statement in February. He called the ordinances “a dangerous overreach” that violate free speech and religious liberty rights.
A Republican loss
In at least one state, conservatives have hit a legal roadblock.
In Wisconsin, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration has been trying since 2020 to enact a statewide conversion therapy ban proposed by the state agency that oversees provider licensing.
But the ban has been blocked twice by a Republican-controlled legislative committee.
Evers’ administration sued.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court sided with Evers last month, ruling that the state legislative committee was overreaching and couldn’t block the rule.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)This story first appeared in the Rhode Island Current.
Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”
Victims compensated
But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
Street-level violence prevention programs have been decimated by Trump just ahead of summer

The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.
If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
‘The most heinous acts’
“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
States push to combat human trafficking amid federal funding cuts

“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.
Other state AGs that joined represent Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

It’s been six weeks now since President Donald Trump signed the so-called one big, beautiful bill act into law and as you’ve no doubt heard, the new law will soon bring massive funding cuts and policy changes to core safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP food benefits. Meanwhile, here in North Carolina, state lawmakers have passed a so-called mini-budget that, while vastly smaller in scale and scope, will still have significant impacts on health policy.
So, what do these changes look like? Who will be impacted? What issues remain unresolved? And why are some important players in the health care system deeply concerned? NC Newsline recently got a chance to explore all of these questions and more with the editor and founder of the nonprofit news outlet North Carolina Health News, Rose Hoban.

Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly on Aug. 6 asked for a disaster declaration after severe storms that included tornadoes and flash flooding from June 3 to 7. The storms damaged farms and homes, downed electric power lines, and made roads impassable in some areas.
In a letter to the president, U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, along with Reps. Tracey Mann, Derek Schmidt, Sharice Davids and Ron Estes, said the storms left lasting effects.
“Federal support must be provided to assist our state in emergency response and restoration efforts,” the letter said.
The letter said Kansas would qualify for more than $7.5 million in federal assistance based on damage to Barber, Butler, Chase, Cowley, Coffey, Franklin, Greenwood, Harper, Lyon, Morris and Osage counties.
The Republican senators and three Republican representatives joined with Davids, the lone Democrat in the congressional delegation, in expressing “our wholehearted support for the governor’s request.”

Patrick Morrisey is sending the West Virginia National Guard to Washington, D.C., to bolster the Trump administration’s policing of the nation’s capital through a federal crackdown. 
Morrisey announced the move over the weekend, saying 300 to 400 skilled personnel would be sent to Washington along with “mission-essential equipment” to support the D.C. National Guard.
President Donald Trump has declared a “public safety emergency” in Washington, D.C.,  mobilizing the local National Guard to “take back” the capital from what he described as violent criminals. Washington’s elected officials have objected to the president’s claims about the city’s crime. 
Morrisey said he was providing the West Virginia National Guard at the request of the Trump administration. Four other Republican-led states, including Ohio, have now sent guard members to Washington, D.C. in support of the president.
“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital,” Morrisey said in a news release. “The men and women of our National Guard represent the best of our state, and this mission reflects our shared commitment to a strong and secure America.” 
  Del. Josh Holstein, R-Boone
Morrisey’s office said the mission will be funded at the federal level. 
West Virginia Adjutant General Maj. Gen. Jim Seward said the National Guard is an “invaluable partner in the important undertaking” of addressing crime in the nation’s capital. 
Josh Holstein, chair of the West Virginia Republican Party, said Morrisey “made the right call” by sending guard troops to Washington, D.C.
“West Virginians overwhelmingly support President Trump and are proud of his effort to restore law and order to our nation’s capital,” Holstein said. “This modest deployment will not diminish important work in our state, but when our neighbors need help, West Virginia is always willing to step up.” 
  Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha
State Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin said the move was “political theater” under Morrisey close allyship with Trump.
“We have enormous respect for the men and women of the West Virginia National Guard, but it’s shameful that Morrisey is making them complicit in Trump’s latest political stunt,” Pushkin said, adding that he believed that the Trump’s initiative was a distraction from the president’s “broken pledge to release the [Jeffrey] Epstein files.”
“The real tragedy here is that instead of helping their neighbors recover from devastating floods at home — our guard members are being shipped off to serve as props in the Trump — Morrisey political theater.”
  W.Va. House Minority Leader Del. Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell
Morrisey doesn’t need the Legislature’s approval to direct the National Guard to the nation’s capital.
A spokesperson for House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, said he was unable to comment on the directive by deadline due to his schedule. Senate President Randy Smith, R-Preston, didn’t return a request for comment.
House Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle, D-Cabell, echoed Pushkin’s comments, calling the move “highly irresponsible” while West Virginia was still recovering from deadly flooding in the Wheeling Area, which the National Guard has assisted with, and facing other pressing issues like public education and road repairs. 
“This is a continuation of campaign theatrics,” Hornbuckle said. “There’s no true governance here, and we desperately need to focus our attention on matters that are affecting West Virginians today.”
Last week, Morrisey announced West Virginia National Guard members along with law enforcement would expand immigration enforcement operations in the state, partnering with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to go through a specialized training program. Seward said 175 Guard members would join the program, which gives officers authority to carry out certain ICE functions.

During a UF Board of Trustees meeting Monday, Chair Mori Hosseini provided a brief update about the school’s leadership. 
“I’m continuing to work, working on identifying a candidate for interim president,” Hosseini said during the virtual meeting. “This has been a focus over the past few months and I have taken a deliberate and thoughtful approach to this responsibility.”
Fuchs, president of the flagship university from 2015-2023, agreed to serve as interim president on Aug. 1, 2024, after former President Ben Sasse unexpectedly left the post last summer. 
A year elapsed, and Fuchs agreed to extend his one-year agreement for another month, until Sept. 1. 
The search for an official president took an unprecedented turn earlier this year. 
UF trustees in May unanimously approved former University of Michigan President Santa Ono to be the next leader of the institution. However, final approval required by the Board of Governors of the State University System proved a problem. 
Following a long interview in which governors grilled Ono about his past support for diversity, equity, and inclusion, among other topics, they rejected him in June, sending UF trustees back to the beginning. 
Hosseini stood by his support for Ono even after the rejection.

Candidates for the interim and official roles now have to consider whether to subject themselves to the political scrutiny that Ono, who resigned from his Michigan job before the failed vote, went through.
Florida’s higher education presidencies are increasingly populated by politicians.

Former Lt. Gov. and now-Florida International University President Jeanette Nuñez;
Former Department of Juvenile Justice Secretary and now-Pasco-Hernando State College President Eric Hall;
Former GOP state House Leader and now-Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner; and
Former lobbyist and state board appointee and now-Florida A&M University President Marva Johnson; all started their jobs within the past year.

The experience of the original presidential search, with members of Florida’s congressional delegation weighing in with political complaints — plus Gov. Ron DeSantis’ intervention in presidential searches at other institutions — appear to be shadowing the process. 
Hosseini said the UF board will interview and vote on an interim president candidate as soon as he identifies one.
“I know that you all are not settling for just anyone that wants the position or that might be recommended. You want the very best for the institution,” Fuchs told trustees. 
Additional searches
The University of South Florida is also in the midst of a presidential search, as is  the University of West Florida.
USF President Rhea law announced earlier this year she would retire after the university names a new president.
Former UWF President Martha Saunders resigned before her contract expired shortly after the system’s Board of Governors and DeSantis overhauled the institution’s board of trustees, making way for former Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. to take over as interim president. He’s expressed interest in the official title.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins introduced the initiative by the Trump administration after a Future Farmers of America breakfast at the State Fairgrounds in Lebanon where she said the federal government will make new grants to bolster Tennessee farming while targeting grants that don’t help farmers’ production.
Rollins criticized the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act and “market distorting incentives” for solar panels, which she said are eliminating Tennessee farmland.
The secretary made the statements even though a study by the nonpartisan Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations found that solar facilities aren’t likely to be the “primary driver” of development on farmland for decades. The study also determined that land can be returned to farming once a solar facility goes out of use.

Earlier this year, the federal government made dramatic cuts to higher education grants, including eliminating more than $31 million in funding to the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture, which houses agricultural research and resources for Tennessee farmers and communities in 95 counties.
Rollins defended the reductions, saying “Those cuts were being made in programs that did not align with the president’s vision of putting farmers first.”
Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden of Tennessee described the reduction as a “repurposing” and said changes were made in research funding based on whether a grant “helps a farmer in the field make more money.” Projects aimed at “clean energy” or based on “racial criteria” were eliminated, he said.
In addition to stopping solar panel development on farmland, Rollins announced that nearly $89 million will go toward 13 rural development projects in 28 Tennessee counties to “promote partnerships” and infrastructure investments for rural education. The department has distributed nearly $100 million this year to more than 10,000 farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, according to Rollins.
Some farmers have said they expect prices to increase because of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which are forcing them to pass on higher rates to customers. Rollins said Monday the administration has signed eight new trade agreements expected to boost the nation’s economy.

Article Summary

JB Pritzker signed 266 bills on Friday, one of which has already sparked a lawsuit backed by Republicans.
Pritzker also vetoed a measure that was supported by Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs, saying it could have benefited “extremist” groups.
Another law will create a statewide office to oversee and assist public defenders.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

The governor signed 266 laws on Friday, moving closer to finalizing his part in approving — or rejecting — over 430 laws sent to him by lawmakers this spring.
The new laws include measures to make public defenders more independent, tighten safety regulations at warehouses and increase the age for required annual driver tests.
Gov. JB Pritzker also vetoed two bills, a somewhat rare move from a governor of the same party as the legislature’s supermajorities. One veto was somewhat technical — a budget provision already implemented the policy — but the other highlighted a policy disagreement between him and the state treasurer.
Toxic substance lawsuits  
One of the bills Pritzker signed Friday invited almost immediate pushback from Republicans and business groups.
The law, outlined in Senate Bill 328, allows lawsuits to continue against companies that operate in Illinois even if the company and plaintiffs are from other states. The law only applies to cases dealing with “toxic” substances under state law.
The law is seen as good for trial lawyers, who might see expanded business opportunities under the new law. The head of the Illinois Trial Lawyers Associations applauded the governor’s approval last week and said that the “sole intent” of the new law is provide justice for people exposed to toxic substances.
But critics, like the Illinois Manufacturers Association, say the measure will be bad for business.
A group of Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit challenging the bill earlier this summer, criticizing it as legalizing “litigation tourism.”

That lawsuit – focused on the legislative process more than the bill’s contents – could also end the practice of passing “gut-and-replace” bills. That’s a procedural maneuver where lawmakers modify a bill already passed in one chamber of the General Assembly with an amendment that removes the entire bill and replaces it.
This move is unpopular among some lawmakers who see it as unconstitutional because it limits or precludes substantial debate on a bill’s actual contents. The lawsuit is still pending in Sangamon County.
Pritzker vetoes nonprofit investment pool 
Another measure — this one backed by state treasurer Michael Frerichs — would have allowed Frerichs’ office to create an investment pool for Illinois nonprofits. The treasurer’s office would then invest those funds and provide the returns on those investments back to the nonprofits.
But Pritzker vetoed Senate Bill 246, saying that the measure had harmful unintended consequences.
“It would unfortunately allow Illinois’ financial investments to be used to benefit fringe and extremist groups,” Pritzker wrote. “I cannot sign a bill that unintentionally allows extremist groups to advance their hateful missions by exploiting state services and resources.”
Pritzker pointed to an Indiana nonprofit linked to the Oath Keepers, an anti-government militia that watchdog groups label as an “extremist” organization. Leaders of the group were found guilty of seditious conspiracy for their role in the U.S. Capitol riots on Jan. 6, 2021.
Pritzker said that organization would be eligible for the investment fund program. But the treasurer issued a statement countering that claim.
“I strongly disagree with the governor’s misguided belief that hate groups would use a state investment pool,” Frerichs said in a statement. “The bill specifically requires that to be eligible, a nonprofit must provide a copy of their audited financial statements. No hate group would ever agree to that. Sunshine remains the best disinfectant for fighting hate.”
Statewide public defender office
Another law signed Friday, contained in House Bill 3363, will create the “Office of State Public Defender” to provide public defender offices throughout the state with more resources. It also reforms the public defender appointment process in an effort to give public defenders more independence from local judges.
An analysis of public defender data from a Northwestern University research team, which supported the bill, found that Illinois had a shortage of public defenders in fiscal year 2023, with only about 56% of the needed number currently allocated statewide.
A 2021 report commissioned by the Illinois Supreme Court found similar results in nine counties. None of those counties had sufficient resources to provide defendants with proper legal representation.

The need for public defenders has also increased in years since the state’s abolition of cash bail in 2023. Cases now require more work in the pretrial phase.
Lawmakers appropriated $10 million for county public defense services in this year’s budget, the same they’ve appropriated since 2023.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)A bipartisan group of former elected officials from Wisconsin on Monday criticized President Donald Trump’s promise to end mail-in voting and the use of electronic voting machines. 
In a Monday morning post on his social media site Truth Social, Trump said that he’d issue an executive order to end the practices ahead of next year’s midterm elections. 
“I am going to lead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, and also, while we’re at it, Highly ‘Inaccurate,’ Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES,” Trump wrote.
Neither the president nor the federal government has the authority to manage election administration in this way. The law gives individual states broad power to decide how to run their own elections. 
Wisconsin’s election system is the most decentralized in the country, giving much of the authority over how to conduct voting to the state’s 1,850 municipal clerks. The state allows mail-in absentee voting without requiring voters to provide a reason, and the electronic voting machines approved for use in the state are incapable of connecting to the internet. Electronic voting machines are more accurate at tallying votes than a human hand counting them. 
After Trump’s post, the Democracy Defense Project-Wisconsin board, which includes former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, former Attorney General JB Van Hollen, former U.S. Representative Scott Klug, and former Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Mike Tate, said in a statement that such an action would increase inaccuracy in the state’s elections. 
“The Constitution is clear: the federal government does not administer elections at the state level,” the group said. “In fact, improved access to voting methods, including the electronic machines Wisconsin uses that produce paper ballots and are unable to be connected to the internet, have benefitted Republicans just as much as Democrats. Wisconsin has displayed time and time again that our elections are safe and secure, and while we can always make them more efficient, there is no tolerance for inaccuracy in our results.”

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.”
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies.
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula.
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.

If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
‘The most heinous acts’
“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
Facing cuts, abuse survivors implore Maine lawmakers to bolster victim services funding

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.
Other state AGs that joined represent Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

With few exceptions, insurance companies selling health coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace plan to increase rates in 2026. In the Kansas City area, all but one carrier have asked Kansas and Missouri regulators for the right to bump up premiums — in one case by 40%.
Only Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City proposed a decrease.
The story is similar across the country.
A survey of proposed rates by KFF and the Peterson Center on Healthcare found a median planned increase of 18% among the 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces nationwide. That is 11 percentage points higher than last year and the steepest increase request since 2018.
Only four insurers nationwide said they would decrease rates.
According to the KFF report, insurance companies cited numerous reasons for the increases, including inflation, increasing labor costs and the high price of specialty drugs like GLP-1 weight loss medications.
But health policy experts said much of the blame should fall on new Trump administration laws and policies that will increase the cost of marketplace coverage, drive healthy people to drop out and leave behind patients who cost the most.
 Expiring tax credits and new rules

The first policy that will drive up prices is that enhanced tax credits are expected to expire.
Since 2021 those tax credits have offset the cost of health plans for more than 90% of people enrolled in the ACA marketplaces and made coverage more widely available. The tax credits, which helped double marketplace enrollment between 2021 and 2025, expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn’t renew them.
The second policy driving up prices involves a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rule that overhauls how the marketplace operates.
Some changes will make it harder for people to enroll and keep coverage, such as shortening the enrollment period, eliminating automatic reenrollment and adding stricter eligibility checks. Other changes upend how insurance payments are formulated, which could drive up premiums and force people to pay more for deductibles and copays.
“The bottom line is that out-of-pocket premiums will go up,” said Gideon Lukens, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who co-authored a report about the changes. “People will pay higher deductibles and copays, and the maximum out-of-pocket limits will also go up. … And then a lot of people lose coverage as a result.”
 Comparable to repealing Obamacare

The ACA marketplace reached more than 24 million enrollees nationally in 2025, including 417,000 in Missouri and 200,050 in Kansas. That was a record, and double the enrollment in 2021 when enhanced tax subsidies first went into effect. During that same period, Missouri’s enrollment also doubled, while Kansas’ climbed 133%.
But those enrollment highs are widely expected to plummet next year as premiums increase. In a recent report, the Kansas Health Institute predicted that Kansas ACA enrollment could immediately return to 2021 levels and uninsured rates could “greatly increase.”
Anything that makes insurance harder to get — and especially more expensive — leads to fewer people being covered, experts said.
And next year’s potential insurance premium increases come as the Congressional Budget Office predicts that policy changes from the Trump administration will lead to an annual decline in overall resources for the country’s poorest households between 2026 and 2034. The CBO said poor households will lose an average of $1,200 annually during the period, while top-income households can expect to gain $13,600.
Lukens said increased health insurance premiums caused by the expiration of enhanced tax credits and CMS rule changes could effectively lead the country back to a time before the ACA was adopted, when many people couldn’t afford insurance and found it difficult to access health care.
“It’s not a repeal of the ACA, but the size of the impact is comparable,” he said. “The way it’s done is more of a death-by-a-thousand-cuts way — a lot of changes that will just generally add a lot of red tape and make it harder for people to keep coverage, to enroll in coverage, and will raise costs. But the overall impact of it will be to increase the number of people without coverage by getting close to where we were before the ACA.”
 A vicious cycle

Once the dust settles, an estimated 8 million people are expected to lose coverage through the ACA marketplace. On top of that, 9 million could lose Medicaid under federal legislation passed in July, which cuts federal spending on the program by close to $1 trillion and adds new obstacles to keep coverage, like work requirements and documenting hours worked.
“The worst case scenario here is bad,” said Caitlin Donovan, a spokesperson for the Patient Advocate Foundation, which helps people around the country with chronic and life-threatening illnesses find care. “It’s really bad.”
Ultimately, she said, when people lose health coverage they’re less likely to seek care and more likely to get sicker before getting help. That makes care cost more, puts more strain on hospitals and other health care providers and, ultimately, continues the cycle of insurance rates climbing.
“There is going to be a sicker population that’s in a much worse situation,” Donovan said.
When people who are young and healthy don’t participate in the insurance market, leaving behind people who are more expensive to cover, it can trigger a cycle of increasing premiums, said Christopher Garmon, assistant professor of health administration at the University of Missouri-Kansas City.
“Anything that makes healthy people less likely to enroll is going to increase costs and cause premiums to go up, and make healthy people less likely to enroll,” he said. “And that is a vicious cycle.”
ACA premium changes will vary based on where a person lives, their age and income. KFF has a calculator that can help people know how much they may see rates increase come January.
The Commonwealth Fund estimates that people in Missouri who receive tax credits will see a $720 jump in annual premiums, while the same group in Kansas will see a $590 annual increase.
 Rising premiums in Kansas and Missouri

Most of the insurance companies in the Kansas and Missouri marketplaces have requested premium increases next year.
In Kansas, Celtic Insurance Co. proposed a 40% increase, the highest jump. But Medica Insurance Co. said its rates need to go up 29.3% in Kansas. In Missouri, Medica proposed an increase of 29.2%, while Celtic proposed a jump of 24.4%.
Celtic could not be reached for comment.
Medica provided a written statement, saying the company’s rate request “reflects the trend toward increased use of medical services as well as the expiration of enhanced subsidies for those who depend on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for coverage.”
“We urge the Congress to promptly extend assistance that promotes stability in this vital market serving millions of Americans,” the Medica statement said.
Other carriers in the Kansas City market proposing rate increases include Oscar Insurance Co., which is asking for a 14.4% increase in Kansas and an 11.7% increase in Missouri, and United Healthcare Insurance Co., which wants a 10.1% bump in Kansas and a 10.7% increase in Missouri.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is the only carrier in the market — and one of just four in the country — planning to lower rates next year.
The company said it would drop rates 6.1% in Kansas and 4.4% in Missouri.
In a written statement, Rachel Arnett, Blue Cross vice president of sales, said the company had “evaluated our product offerings, gathered feedback from our customers, and developed a variety of options on the ACA Marketplace for health insurance in 2026.”
Those include “a new focused provider network,” which it said would bring lower premiums and predictable cost, and plans to offer its primary care model, Spira Care Access, through nine area centers.
A spokesperson for the carrier declined to answer questions about the rate reduction and did not provide other details about the scope of the coverage.
 Less help available 

Proposed rates must be approved by state insurance regulators before they are officially listed in the marketplace.
That should happen this fall in time for the ACA marketplaces’ open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1. This year, people will have until Jan. 15 to complete enrollment. But next year that window will shorten to Nov. 1 through Dec. 15.
But many people may not realize how much the ACA will be changing next year or understand what options they may have for coverage. That’s because earlier this year the Trump administration cut funding for navigators who help people find health insurance through the ACA marketplace or, if they qualify, Medicaid.
Funding for public information campaigns about ACA coverage and the open enrollment period has also been cut, meaning some enrollees could miss deadlines or forget to reenroll, which could also add to the number of uninsured.
Justin Gust, vice president of community engagement with El Centro Inc., said he’s seen this play out before. The last time Trump was in the White House virtually all of the funding for public information campaigns was eliminated. And the consequences were not good.
“There was a huge reduction in people enrolling,” he said.

Gerrymandering. Most Americans have come to be familiar with this phenomenon in which politicians rig electoral maps and elections for partisan purposes, but unless you’re a serious political observer, you may not be up to speed on just how far out of control this destructive practice has gotten of late or, indeed, how unless something is done soon, it might well spiral out of control.
Fortunately, a handful of experts have been monitoring and chronicling the gerrymandering mess for some time and one of the most knowledgeable is author Dave Daley. Daley — a senior fellow at the nonprofit FairVote — is author of the books “Rat-Effed: Why Your Vote Doesn’t Count” and “Antidemocratic: Inside the Far Right’s 50-Year Plot to Control American Elections,” and recently he penned an op-ed for the Washington Post in which he noted that the 2026 midterms might not be decided by tariffs or President Trump’s approval ratings, but by gerrymandering. And NC Newsline recently  caught up with him to learn the details.
In Part One of our extended conversation, we explored the sobering current reality of how Republican state-level politicians – most notably right now in Texas — are, at the urging of President Trump, attempting to rig the 2026 midterm elections by gerrymandering their state congressional maps in unprecedented ways.
In Part Two of our conversation, we looked into the ways in which the gerrymandering wars could spin out of control, how the only realistic solution to the problem lies in congressional action, how President Trump’s effort to initiate a mid-decade census is fraught with problems, and how yet another case to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court this fall could further fuel the fires that threaten American democracy.

Fire area now stretches from 11 miles east of Thermopolis to the borders of Fremont and Washakie counties. Large rural areas are under evacuation orders. 
The post Wyoming’s Red Canyon Fire balloons to over 91,000 acres amid evacuations, emergency order appeared first on WyoFile .","A major wildland fire outside Thermopolis escalated significantly over the weekend, driving further evacuation warnings and an increasing federal response as the burn stretched from Hot Springs County to its borders with Fremont and Washakie counties.
The Red Canyon Fire began Wednesday and by Monday morning covered more than 91,000 acres — an area nearly the size of Denver — as strong winds and dry grass fueled its growth. The fire remains 11 miles east of Thermopolis, and evacuation orders so far appear limited to mostly rural areas. It is burning across ridges and creek drainages dominated by grassland and brush. 
WyoFile has sought an estimate of the number of homes affected by the evacuation orders but has so far not received one from official sources. There are “numerous structures threatened” after extreme fire behavior and large runs of flames driven by the wind over the weekend, the National Interagency Fire Center reported Monday.
The fire gained more than 20,000 acres Sunday into Monday, that agency reported. 
The areas under evacuation orders remain well to the east of the Bighorn River, which is lined by ranches, guesthouses, RV campgrounds and other businesses as it runs north out of Thermopolis toward Worland.

As of Monday morning, firefighters were working at least two fronts of the fire, and the most intense activity appeared to be on the fire’s south end. Firefighters on the northern end of the fire were conducting mop up operations and searching for hot spots — areas still smoldering  after the main thrust of the flames has moved on or been extinguished. 
Crews on the fire’s southern end were working to prevent the fire from spreading further in that direction, according to officials. 
There are two other significant fires burning in the Bighorn Basin, though they did not see the same level of growth as the Red Canyon Fire. The Spring Creek Fire near Ten Sleep is now at 3,575 acres, according to Washakie County Emergency Management, and crews under state management have made progress controlling it, working 24-hour shifts.
Firefighters were able to achieve even more containment of the Sleeper Ranch Fire, near Meeteetsee, which is currently estimated at 18,046 acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. That fire threatens sage grouse habitat and energy infrastructure. 
Fires burn in mosaic patterns of intensity, and acreage measurements provided during ongoing fires do not mean the flames are burning across all that distance. 
Gov. Mark Gordon declared a state of emergency Monday, which allows him to bring the Wyoming National Guard into the response if needed and also gives the state access to some federal funding. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency on Aug. 15 authorized federal funding to cover 75% of any state level firefighting costs connected with the Red Canyon Fire. 
Also on Monday, a new federal team took over managing the Red Canyon Fire, indicating its growing complexity — determined largely by fire size, weather and the number of homes and infrastructure threatened. 
The Rocky Mountain Area Complex Incident Management Team 2 assumed command of the fire at 7 a.m. Monday, team public information officer Dakota Baker told WyoFile. Following days of high wind and worrying thunderstorms Sunday that could have brought other lightning-caused ignitions, officials Monday said they expected a very slight reprieve from an incoming high pressure system. 
“Winds are expected to shift to more typical upslope and up-valley patterns gusting up to 20 mph throughout the day,” the new incident management team posted in a Monday morning update. But hot temperatures reaching into the 90s, and low humidity, also lay ahead. 
Officials reported portions of two area roads as closed during the Red Canyon Fire: Buffalo Creek and Black Mountain roads. On Sunday and again on Monday, federal officials reported that some local residents were taking “independent actions” to protect their homes and as a result firefighters had to divert resources away from combatting the flames, though few details were provided. 
“For firefighter safety and public safety, please avoid working in fire area,” Monday’s update asked. Private drone flights had also been a problem, as they have been at an increasing number of fires nationwide in recent years. When people fly drones to document wildfires, it can ground the airborne water and fire retardant tankers, helicopters and other aircraft that are often critical to stemming flames’ rapid advance. 
“If you fly, we can’t,” Monday’s statement read. 
On Monday evening, at 7 p.m., the incident management team and other state and local officials will gather for a community meeting at the Hot Springs County High School.

LaMonica McIver argues in new court filings that she is immune to prosecution over a melee that occurred in May while she was visiting a migrant jail in Newark.,"Rep. LaMonica McIver argues in new court filings that she is immune to prosecution over a melee that occurred in May while she was visiting a migrant jail in Newark. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Federal assault charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver should be thrown out just as similar charges facing dozens of people involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol were tossed, McIver’s lawyers argue in a new court filing.
McIver, a Democrat accused of shoving officers during a melee at a migrant jail in Newark in May, said there is no “conduct-based justification” for the U.S. Department of Justice dismissing cases against 160 people involved in the Jan. 6 riot but continuing to prosecute her for allegedly violating the same statute.
“Her alleged conduct was manifestly less egregious than storming the Capitol, throwing explosives, beating officers with bats and riot shields, and spraying them with pepper spray. Some of those defendants had significant criminal histories. Some admitted that they engaged in their assaultive conduct as part of an effort to overturn an election. Some escalated their threats in the subsequent days. Some bragged about their exploits and vowed that they would do it again,” one of the new filings says.
McIver was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting or impeding officers while Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, was arrested May 9 outside of immigration detention center Delaney Hall. Prosecutors say McIver, who says she was there with two other members of Congress to conduct an oversight visit, interfered as federal agents attempted to arrest Baraka for trespassing (prosecutors dropped the charge against Baraka days later). 










If these charges are allowed to move forward, they will send a chilling message to Congress on the risk it takes when it scrutinizes the Administration’s activities.


– Rep. LaMonica McIver's attorneys


McIver, who was elected to Congress last year, has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A judge set a tentative trial date of Nov. 10.
In four briefs filed Friday, McIver’s attorneys urge a federal judge to dismiss the three counts. Her lawyers argue the confrontation was provoked by agents who escalated the situation, that her inspection of Delaney Hall was a legislative act that she cannot be prosecuted over, and that evidence cited in the indictment is contradictory to video footage of the episode shared by the Department of Homeland Security. McIver also wants a judge to order the Department of Homeland Security to delete social media posts that McIver’s attorneys say harm her ability to have a fair trial.
“Individually and collectively, those statements are extraordinarily prejudicial: they unequivocally declare Congresswoman McIver’s guilt; they assail the defenses DHS expects her to assert; they demean her as a ‘gutter politician’ responsible for purportedly escalating rates of assault on ICE agents; and they attempt to associate her with ‘Murderers, Rapists, Suspected Terrorists, and Gang Members’ supposedly housed in the detention facility that the Congresswoman inspected on May 9, 2025, as part of her congressionally authorized oversight responsibility,” one of the filings says.
The incident at the center of the allegations was recorded on videos shared publicly by the Department of Homeland Security. Attorneys for McIver, who is seen in the videos pushing two agents during a chaotic scuffle, call her actions a “modest, proportional, and reactive response to a flood of armed and marked ICE agents.” Federal prosecutors previously said she acted as a “human shield” preventing Baraka’s arrest.

One of McIver’s arguments for dismissal of the indictment focuses on whether her prosecution violates the Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which grants members of Congress broad immunity for legislative acts. McIver, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, “unquestionably had congressional authority” to conduct oversight on government agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, her attorneys argue.
Putting McIver on trial for constitutionally vested duties would deter other Congress members from oversight and “imperil the separation of powers,” that filing says.
“That sort of intimidation of independent legislative prerogatives is exactly the evil that legislative immunity was designed to prevent,” her attorneys wrote.
McIver’s filings cite a U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 2016 that found against then-Sen. Bob Menendez’s arguments that he was indicted over legislative acts protected by the speech and debates clause. That decision said some lawmakers’ actions are “manifestly legislative” — and McIver’s attorneys argue her actions at Delaney Hall on May 9 were indeed manifestly legislative.
“Her sole purpose was to fulfill her constitutional and statutory responsibility of Executive Branch oversight,” they said.
One of the lawmakers who visited Delaney Hall on May 9 with McIver was Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08), the former senator’s son.
McIver’s attorneys also argue that legislators conducting oversight amid escalating immigration enforcement tactics from the Trump administration “have been met with alarming resistance.” They point to Baraka’s arrest, the detention of California Sen. Alex Padilla after questioning Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference, and New York City Comptroller Brad Landler’s arrest at an immigration court. 
“If these charges are allowed to move forward, they will send a chilling message to Congress on the risk it takes when it scrutinizes the Administration’s activities. The Speech of Debate Clause was designed to prevent that kind of message and intimidation,” one of McIver’s filings says.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/0JS13795_1-1024x759.jpg,,,2025-08-18 14:57:34.812450

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Violent crime victims and their families across the country stand to lose more than $1 billion in direct compensation and support services under federal directives that illegally condition state grants on compliance with unrelated immigration policies.
So argued 21 Democratic state attorneys general, including Rhode Island’s Peter Neronha, in a new lawsuit filed in Rhode Island federal court on Monday. The complaint seeks to stop the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi from withholding statutory federal funds under the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal civil immigration enforcement.
Rhode Island is among more than dozen states facing threats from the Trump administration for alleged “sanctuary” policies. Bondi in an Aug. 13 letter to Gov. Dan McKee demanded the state get rid of its policies that “thwart federal immigration enforcement, warning of criminal charges and yanking federal funding if state officials refuse to comply.
McKee and Neronha have previously rebuffed the “sanctuary” label, pointing to a 2014 federal judge’s ruling as the determinant of state immigration policies. 
“This case isn’t about a lack of cooperation with the federal government when it comes to law enforcement,” Neronha said in a virtual press conference on Monday. Instead, he argued that the federal administration’s “trumped up” request for states to carry out civil immigration policies — finding and detaining undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes — was beyond the scope of what local public safety agencies can, or should, do.
Attorneys General Matthew Platkin of New Jersey, Kathy Jennings of Delaware, Rob Bonta of California, and Kwame Raoul of Illinois, also participated in the Zoom call with reporters Monday as co-lead plaintiffs on the case.
“We need our state police and our local police investigating violent and other crime,” Neronha said. “That’s their job, that’s what they are trained to do, that’s what we need them to do.”

42,000 RI crime victims compensated in FY24
But that logic has not swayed the federal administration, which is threatening to pull funding for victims of gun violence, sexual assault, armed robberies and other violent crimes to pay for lawyers, shelter, funeral and burial services and counseling and other recovery supports. For federal fiscal year 2024, Rhode Island received nearly $3.3 million in federal VOCA funds helping nearly 42,000 violent crime victims and their families with direct compensation and support services through partner nonprofits.
It’s the first time in the federal law’s 41-year history that Rhode Island and other states might not get the congressionally appropriated money, based on a population-driven formula. 
Bondi put states on notice in February, warning broadly about cuts to federal funding for states that failed to comply with federal immigration policies.
The threat solidified last month, when the DOJ’s Office for Victims of Crime issued its annual notice alerting states of the window to apply for formula-driven and competitive grants to help violent crime victims. The July 21 memo explicitly stated that states that obstruct or don’t help federal immigration agents find, arrest and detain undocumented immigrants will not receive funding.
If the DOJ follows through on this threat, it would cut off nearly $1.4 billion to states in federal fiscal 2025, in turn hurting victims of crimes, and their families, according to the AGs lawsuit.
“In short, lapses in grant funding, even if temporary, would result in the sudden and massive disruption of state victim services programs that have historically been supported by USDOJ grant funds,” the complaint states. “Among other things, this could result in unsafe conditions for victims and their families. Furthermore, this loss in VOCA funding and curtailment of victim support services would likely impact victims’ willingness to cooperate with law enforcement and adversely impact law enforcement efforts throughout the State.”
The legal arguments echo the 32 federal lawsuits Neronha’s office has led or joined since Trump took office, focused on Constitutional violations of separation of powers and spending. Despite the flurry of legal challenges Democratic attorneys general have not lost vigor and passion — touting their wins during the press conference in securing preliminary and long-term blocks to federal actions on everything from research grants to education funding.
The complaint also references a separate lawsuit filed by 17 state-level coalitions that help domestic violence and sexual assault survivors. Earlier this month, Rhode Island Senior District Judge William. E. Smith temporarily blocked the federal government from withholding Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grants based on directives around gender ideology and diversity initiatives. The 1994 federal law offers formula-driven funds for sexual assault and domestic violence victims, two subgroups of violent crime victims helped by the Victims of Crime Act, which preceded it by a decade.
The latter also addresses victims and families of gun violence, elder abuse, stalking and harassment and childhood abuse and neglect, among other types of violent crimes. Since 2011, the federal fund has also paid nearly $15 billion to more than 65,600 claimants who were hurt, became sick or died from the Sept. 11 attacks. 
‘The most heinous acts’
“This administration is holding hostage over $1 billion directly to support some of the most heinous acts anyone will ever do,” Platkin of New Jersey said during the virtual press conference. Platkin later declared the Trump administration “the most anti-public safety administration” in modern history.
Neronha echoed Platkin’s outrage.
“This Administration is hanging Americans out to dry; in this case American victims who are attempting to pick up the pieces of their lives, bury their family members, and see to it that criminals responsible for hurting them and their loved ones are held accountable,” Neronha said. “In this country, above all else, we expect our government to protect us, and this latest move flies in the face of that expectation.”
The lawsuit asks a federal judge to force the DOJ to remove the strings attached to its federal crime victim funding, and permanently prevent the federal administration from imposing any conditions later.
The clock is ticking, with an Aug. 20 deadline for states to submit their final applications for federal grants. Awards are expected to be announced by Sept. 30.
“If USDOJ refuses to award funds to Plaintiff States that do not comply with the Immigration Enforcement Conditions, the window for Plaintiffs to have secured FY 2025 VOCA funding will have passed,” the complaint states. “As a result, even if Plaintiffs ultimately prevail in having the Conditions vacated and declared unlawful, critical programs for victims and survivors that have long been supported by USDOJ grants will be irreparably disrupted.  
In addition to formula-driven awards, states can also seek additional, competitive grants. Rhode Island, for example, intends to apply for a technology grant to enhance its VOICE (Victims Outreach Integrated Community Environment) online portal, which streamlines information about court cases, offenders and other information necessary for crime victims, their advocates, and state agencies, according to the complaint. Neronha’s office began developing the portal in fiscal year 2020, though the rollout was delayed to fiscal 2022 because of the pandemic.
Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the Justice Department, declined to comment. The lawsuit also names Maureen Henneberg, acting assistant attorney general for the U.S. Office of Justice programs, and Katherine Darke Schmitt, acting director of the Office for Victims of Crime, as defendants.
Other state AGs that joined represent Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia.

Of those three, state legislators have only tapped into the Legacy Fund for property tax reductions so far, a decision made during the past legislative session. According to the latest poll numbers, 69% of respondents support using the Legacy Fund for additional property tax relief, while 25% oppose that action.
Respondents are also firmly behind the idea of local control of property tax rates. A total
of 68% said those should remain with local political subdivisions, while 28% said those
rates should be decided at the state level.
Former governor Edward Schafer, who played a key role in the creation of the Legacy Fund, said the idea that people want more local control but also want state tax revenue from the Legacy Fund to pay for property tax relief, doesn’t quite match up.
“Putting state money into the deal doesn’t solve the problem,” Schafer said. “It’s got to be that local expenditure and responsibility. If people are saying, I want local control, then you’ve got to put the responsibility locally. While it is a worthwhile expenditure of the earnings of the Legacy Fund, I think that we’re going down the road here of the state taking over local property tax responsibility.”
 Poll: ND voters back tariffs, but mixed on impacts of Trump trade policies 

The value of the Legacy Fund currently stands at $12.5 billion.
A portion of the earnings has gone into the general fund during each biennium since 2019.
Around $686 million was transferred from The Legacy Fund to the general fund for the 2023-2025 period, up from $486 million in the previous biennium, but down from the $871 million distributed during the period before.
Updates were made to definitions of earnings on the Legacy Fund during the last legislative session, with 8% of the 5-year average allowed to be used for the general fund.
Schafer said a concern he has with the continued tapping into the earnings off the
Legacy Fund is that commitments keep getting extended, currently to another decade out. If oil revenues that the Legacy Fund taxes drop, those earnings could shrink.
“Instead of each legislative session setting their priorities, they are expending it out and anticipating spending it out on estimated revenues for years and years and years ahead,” Schafer said. “That’s not the way it should be set up.”
Yes on school meals, no on charter schools
Asked if they would like to see the Legacy Fund tapped for universal school meals, 70% supported that proposal and 26% opposed, according to the poll.
During the past session, House Bill 1553 proposed using around $140 million from the Legacy Fund to cover meals for all K-12 students in the state, but was defeated in the House by a 74-14 vote against the bill.
  (Graphic by Troy Becker/The Forum)
The state legislature expanded eligibility to cover more, but not all, students later in the
session.
“We see again that voters in North Dakota are strongly in favor of that,” said House Minority Leader Zac Ista, D-Grand Forks. “It’s one of those things that will take a financial obligation off their plates and help our students and teachers do better in the classroom.”
Ista said on the property tax measure that was passed, he’s happy to see it is so popular.
“Voters are saying, Hey, can we get a break here?” Ista said. “Can we ease that financial pressure of you know, our property tax bill, whether you’re paying that once a year or every month with your mortgage payment, people see it going up and up, and they want that relief to come their way.”
Respondents went the opposite direction on using the Legacy Fund for paying for school choice initiatives like private school vouchers: 58% opposed while 35% were in favor.
Strong support for Armstrong property tax plan
Most North Dakotans also back Governor Kelly Armstrong’s property tax relief package, which ended up being the choice of the legislature during the last session. That plan increased the existing primary residence property tax credit from $500 to $1600 per year, with a 3% cap on future property tax increases.
A total of 72% of the 625 respondents polled supported that plan, while 18% opposed. Support was relatively even across all political affiliations, though 32% of those identifying as Democrats opposed the plan.
Rick Becker, a former state legislator who drove a statewide measure to essentially abolish property taxes in 2024 that was eventually defeated, said dissent likely came from those who didn’t benefit beyond the residence property tax relief.
“One category would be one where they didn’t go far enough, and that would include farmers who got no relief, and small business or businesses, since property tax relief was left to residential only,” Becker said.
No new tax increases
Most respondents, however, drew the line at raising sales or income taxes to generate revenue to pay for schools, emergency services and infrastructure if property taxes are further reduced.
A total of 53% opposed those increases, 38% supported, and 9% were unsure.
Republicans had the highest level of support for raising those other taxes, with 43% in
favor.
Becker thought the answers could be interpreted several ways and that the numbers
are hard to dissect.
One interpretation is “they would rather not have their property taxes go down if it means sales taxes go up,” he said. Another way to look at it would be “the property tax could go down, but we don’t need sales tax since the local (political subdivisions) are already getting too much money,” Becker added.
“This question leaves open, I think, more questions than it has answers,” he said.
The North Dakota Poll, initiated by the North Dakota News Cooperative, was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy, Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida. From August 4 through August 6, 2025, a total of 625 adult regular voters were interviewed statewide by phone. The margin of error is no more than + or – 4%, according to the polling firm.
A total of 155 respondents were in Fargo-Cass County, 155 in eastern North Dakota, 120 in the Bismarck-Mandan region, and another 195 in western North Dakota. Quotas were assigned to reflect voter turnout by county.
Of the 625 respondents, 135 identified as Democrat (22%), 271 as Republican (43%)
and 219 as independent (35%).

DemasEvery 16 years, Michigan voters are asked whether the state should hold a Constitutional Convention, where a group of delegates will work together to overhaul the state constitution. 
While the mechanism for calling a convention, informally known as a “Con-Con” was written into the Michigan Constitution approved in 1963, the state has yet to call for another convention, with a strong majority of voters rejecting the proposal in 1978, 1994 and 2010. 
With 2026 marking yet another year with a Con-Con proposal on the ballot, opponents from both sides of the aisle are gearing up to speak out against revamping the state constitution, warning the process could fall victim to political extremists. 
On Friday members of Protect MI Constitution from Special Interests filed paperwork to form a ballot question committee to advocate against the Con-Con question, which will appear as Proposal 1 on the ballot. 
What’s a Con-Con? Michigan voters will decide if they want to rewrite the constitution in 2026.

According to the group’s website, its members include individuals from both parties, including small business owners, skilled trades workers, nurses, teachers, police officers and firefighters. 
A statement from the group warns that a Con-Con would cost tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, diverting funds away from programs that benefit Michigan residents. 
During the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) and Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) backed the effort to call a Con-Con. 
While Hall viewed it as an avenue to remove provisions from the state constitution that he said sounded good on paper but had raised frustrations with voters, Nesbitt viewed it as an opportunity to make updates to the document that politicians in Lansing  haven’t had the “political courage … to actually get done.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
If voters do call a convention, a special primary and general election would be held for delegates, with one delegate elected for each of the state’s 110 House districts and 35 Senate districts. The convention would come together in October 2027 and would work to rewrite the state’s constitution with no time limit to propose a new document. Voters would then need to approve the final document.
Among the individuals involved with the opposition effort are Jeff Timmer, the campaign director for the anti-Donald Trump Lincoln Project and a former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party and Dianne Byrum, a founding partner of Byrum & Fisk Advocacy Communications and a former Democratic state lawmaker who served as Michigan House minority leader while Republicans held the majority. 
“Voting no on Proposal 1 protects Michiganders from tax hikes and ensures politicians don’t get to draw the maps of their own districts​, among other things,” Timmer said in a statement. “Voters have already spoken on these and other important changes over the decades. We can’t allow extreme special interest groups to get their hands on our constitution. Michigan’s Constitution already has an effective, proven and fair process to make changes and it shouldn’t be upended by a ​partisan ​Con-Con​, especially in this ​highly divisive​ political moment​.”
Under the current system, Michigan voters can initiate a Constitutional amendment through a petition drive. In order to have the matter placed before all voters in the state, petitioners must gather signatures from registered voters equal to 10% of the votes cast for governor in the previous gubernatorial election. 
“The Michigan Constitution has served us well for over 60 years, and it works,” Byrum said. “Many citizens and organizations realize the dangers of a Con-Con and they are joining our effort to advocate for a no vote on Proposal 1. Together, we will stand up to efforts by wealthy ​partisan ​donors and special interest groups to rewrite Michigan’s Constitution to promote their extreme agendas.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_1410-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 14:57:34.812450

(Photo courtesy of Iowa PBS)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird led a multistate letter Friday questioning whether a new net-zero carbon emissions standard for businesses is illegal under state and federal law.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond was also among the 23 attorneys general who co-signed it the letter sent to David Kennedy, CEO of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a group that recently released its Financial Institutions Net-Zero standard. This standard is meant to aid financial institutions “in addressing their most significant climate impact through alignment and sector-specific targets,” according to the document, through actions like stopping or limiting investments in new projects related to fossil fuel expansion and addressing deforestation risks in existing investments.
This standard could run afoul of state and federal laws limiting ESG investment strategies — practices where investment firms account for “environmental, social and governance factors” when making investments, according to Bird’s letter. According to the law firm Morgan Lewis, there are 20 states with “anti-ESG” rules in effect as of 2023.
Bird also wrote SBTi and the businesses that commit to following the standard may be in violation of state consumer protection laws and federal and state antitrust laws, constituting an illegal boycott by deliberately cutting off investment and insurance for certain industries through their standard on oil, gas, and coal expansion.
“Some economic arrangements are illegal because they are unfair or unreasonably harmful to competition; the ‘good intentions’ behind them are irrelevant,” Bird wrote.
The letter was co-signed by attorneys general from 22 other states — Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It included a list of requested information and documents from SBTi on its communication with members about how it plans to meet net-zero carbon emission commitments, how the standard was developed, and how it is working with insurance companies to reduce emissions.
In a news release Friday, Bird called the standard from SBTi, which partners with the United Nations, the World Wide Fund for Nature and other organizations in providing advisory information, “the next attempt by radical environmentalists to coordinate companies to squeeze important American industries into eliminating carbon dioxide production by some future date.”
“SBTi is trying to redo President Biden’s radical green scheme,” Bird said in a statement. “If successful, they’ll hurt farmers, energy producers, and Iowans. Its program limits output of goods or services, and these unrealistic net-zero programs harm both American agriculture and industry. Making net-zero a goal actively harms Americans, creates risk for energy independence, and increases the cost of safe, healthy, nutritious food.”
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier also took steps to investigate SBTi last week, announcing he would issue subpoenas to the advisory group and the CDP, an international nonprofit focused on environmental impact reporting. The investigation will look into whether these organizations violated state consumer protection and antitrust laws “by coercing companies into disclosing proprietary data and paying for access under the guise of environmental transparency,” according to a news release.
“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift. We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers.”

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina (Photo provided by the S.C.

State Ports Authority the deepest shipping channel along the East Coast.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday that nearly $21.3 million was allocated in this year’s Army Corps of Engineers budget for the harbor deepening project, which concluded in late 2022 after about four years of construction and more than a decade of planning.
All told, the federal government spent $302.6 million toward the nearly $580 million project that took Charleston Harbor to a 52-foot depth from its previous 45 feet, allowing some of the biggest and heaviest container ships to visit the Port of Charleston at any time regardless of tides.
The state’s share of the project was $277 million.
The port now hosts 28 weekly container ship services with vessels carrying up to 16,000 cargo boxes measured in 20-foot equivalents. Two more weekly services will begin in the next few weeks – both of them 15,000-box ships – connecting Charleston to ports in Europe, the Mediterranean and Asia.

Graham – a Republican from Seneca and the deepening project’s biggest proponent in Washington, D.C. – called Charleston’s port “the crown jewel of the East Coast.”
“Failure was not an option,” he said of the project. “If we had failed in this endeavor, it would have crippled our economy. … Of all the things I’ve been involved with, I think this was the most important and most consequential.”
Barbara Melvin, the authority’s president and CEO, said the deeper harbor lets Charleston’s port “move and work vessels at any time, boosting productivity and allowing imports and exports to reach their destination more quickly.”
“Our customers tell us that Charleston is a port they can rely on to help them meet their supply chain objectives,” Melvin added.
The project was the first to go through the Army Corps’ “smart planning” process, designed to eliminate the sluggish timelines and massive red tape federal work had been known for by steering authorization, planning, funding and construction through a single, coordinated and streamlined set of steps.
But there was trouble before that process even began.
South Carolina needed $150,000 in 2011 for a feasibility study to show whether harbor deepening was justified, but that money had been left out of a budget proposal, putting the project at risk before it had begun.
Graham was incensed and threatened “to tie the Senate in knots” by holding up then-President Obama’s administration picks.
“No nominations go forward in the Senate until we address CHS port,” Graham tweeted at the time.
The $150,000 was ultimately approved.
“That was a moment when everything could have collapsed if we didn’t think creatively and act boldly,” Graham said, adding he worked across the aisle to get support for the feasibility study.
In 2012, with the prospects of federal dollars uncertain year-to-year, South Carolina legislators set aside $300 million so the port wouldn’t have to wait on Congress to come through before construction could begin. That money would cover the federal government’s share of the deepening project, with the state getting reimbursed from appropriations years down the road.
Graham said he told S.C. officials at the time that if they fronted the money, he’d eventually get it back to them – a promise realized on Monday.
“We’re in a race to get this done,” Graham recalled telling legislators. “So, let’s go around the bureaucracy.”
When legislators committed the $300 million, that was the total expected price tag for dredging the harbor to 50 feet. Plans later called for a 52-foot depth, and costs went up.
Congress gave its go-ahead to the project in 2015, and construction started three years later – marking the biggest endeavor for the Army Corps’ Charleston office.
“The scale of this work speaks for itself – five major dredging contracts, more than 2 ½ million labor hours, more than one million equipment hours and the removal of more than 40 million cubic yards of dredge material,” said Lt. Col. Todd Mainwaring, district commander of the Army Corps’ Charleston District.
“This project is more than an engineering milestone; it’s a strategic investment in our nation’s infrastructure and economic future,” he said.
While the financial books have now been closed on the deepening project once known as “Post-45,” Melvin said there is more work that needs to be done.
The authority plans to deepen the Cooper River north of the Leatherman Terminal to 52 feet – from its current 48-foot depth – to let the biggest container ships visit an expanded North Charleston Terminal. It’s part of a plan that also involves a new, taller structure to replace the Don Holt bridge along Interstate 526 and expansion of the terminal onto the adjacent former WestRock paper mill site along the riverfront.
Those projects along with Leatherman’s expansion will double the port’s cargo capacity to 10 million cargo containers per year.
“As to the North Charleston component, I think I know what they want me to do,” Graham said. “They want me to help, and we’ll help. If it doubles the capability, it’s money well invested.”

(Courtesy of Doña Ana County)In the wake of further monsoon flooding in July, federal officials over the weekend extended federal disaster aid to include more residents in Southern New Mexico impacted by storms and landslides.
This summer’s deadly and devastating floods have impacted hundreds of homes across the state in separate instances. On July 9, runoff from rains over the 2024 Salt and South Fork burn scar flooded Ruidoso’s rivers and killed three people, including two children; required the rescues of dozens of people; and swept away homes and cars. On July 22, monsoon rains in the deserts of Doña Ana flooded the colonias of Vado around the Rio Grande, flooding at least 110 homes and wrecking infrastructure.
The National Weather Service office in Albuquerque issued a notice that flash flooding risk is high in Ruidoso on Monday through 9 p.m.
With the lack of vegetation and non-absorbant soils in the burn scars, flooding is occurring with very little rain in the Sacramento Mountains around the town, said Todd Shoemake, a lead forecaster at the National Weather Service.
“Our forecast models are indicating pretty heavy rainfall rates, probably raining as much as one to two inches per hour,” he said.

So far, the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency has allocated $2.7 million for damages related to the floods, including $1.6 million for housing assistance. FEMA has approved 235 requests for individual assistance.
According to the federal disaster declaration updated on Saturday, people affected by floods in Doña Ana and Otero counties, along with the Mescalero Apache Nation, will be able to apply for funds for individual housing needs.
The Aug. 16 amendment will also allow governments to apply for reimbursement for permanent repairs in Lincoln, Doña Ana county and Otero counties, including for the Mescalero Apache Tribe.
Local officials in Lincoln and Doña Ana counties have said they’ll need federal funds to rebuild infrastructure such as bridges or sewer and water services, with initial damage estimates in the tens of millions.

Reeves deploys Mississippi National Guard soldiers to D.C., following other GOP-led states",Michael Goldberg,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/18/gov-reeves-deploys-mississippi-national-guard-soldiers-to-d-c-following-other-gop-led-states/,"Reeves, a staunch ally of President Trump, opted to have Mississippi participate in the federal takeover after at least three other Republican-led states had already done so.","Mississippi will send about 200 Mississippi National Guard soldiers to Washington, D.C., to support President Donald Trump’s push to federalize law enforcement in the nation’s capital.
Following the governors of at least three other Republican-led states, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said on social media on Monday that he deployed the troops to bolster Trump’s “effort to return law and order to our nation’s capital.”
“Crime is out of control there, and it’s clear something must be done to combat it,” Reeves said. “Americans deserve a safe capital city that we can all be proud of. I know the brave men and women of our National Guard will do an excellent job enhancing public safety and supporting law enforcement.”
The move comes after Trump signed an executive order federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 District of Columbia National Guard members. He did so after claiming the nation’s capital was gripped by  “lawlessness.”
Washington’s elected officials have disputed these claims, noting that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump’s first term in office. Hundreds of residents of the city marched in protest of the federal crackdown on Saturday.
Reeves, a staunch ally of President Trump, opted to participate in the federal takeover after at least three other Republican-led states had already done so. 
West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said he was deploying 300 to 400 guard troops. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said he deployed 200 at the Pentagon’s request. And Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said he sent 150 guard military police at Army Secretary Dan Driscoll’s request.
Reeves’ announcement on social media did not say who requested support from Mississippi’s National Guard.
The activations from Republican-led states suggest the Trump administration sees the need for additional manpower after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers, according to The Associated Press. 
Trump declared an emergency due to the “city government’s failure to maintain public order.” He said that impeded the “federal government’s ability to operate efficiently to address the nation’s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.”
Monday was not the first time Reeves followed other Republican governors in sending National Guard troops outside the state.  
In 2023, Reeves mobilized a National Guard unit to help with security at the U.S. border with Mexico. That came a day after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent officers to Texas to assist with border security.

According to Brigham City, which is currently handling press communications, an officer with the Tremonton Garland Police Department responded to a neighborhood near Bear River High School at about 9 p.m. Sunday after someone called 911, then hung up, several times.  
The officer began speaking to someone inside the home — that’s when a man emerged from the house with a gun and began shooting at the officer, killing them, according to Brigham City. 
The man then immediately began shooting at a second Tremonton Garland officer who had arrived at the scene, police say. That officer was also killed. 
“They immediately began taking fire. They requested additional units, and then stopped answering their radio,” said Crystal Beck, a detective with Brigham City, speaking to reporters late Sunday night.   
A deputy with the Box Elder County Sheriff’s Office arrived at the scene, taking fire from the man. The deputy, still sitting in a vehicle, was struck, as was their service dog. Both the deputy and the dog stayed in the vehicle until they were evacuated to a hospital, Beck said. 
After firing on the officers, the Brigham City Police Department says bystanders convinced the suspect to put down his gun. He was taken into custody by other responding officers and is currently in the Box Elder Jail. 
“Our community is deeply saddened by the tragic and senseless act of violence,” Tremonton Mayor Lyle Holmgren said in a statement. “This tragedy is a stark reminder of the dangers faced by those who serve and protect. We must unite — not in division, but in strength — to honor their sacrifice, support their families and stand behind all who dedicate their lives to keeping us safe.” 
Beck said that it’s been years since an officer-involved shooting happened in Box Elder County, which is home to about 57,000 people, according to U.S. Census data.

The legend of 19-year-old Mississippi baseball phenom Konnor Griffin continues to grow and grow with each home run blast, each stolen base, each fielding gem, each promotion. Who knows where he will be when he reaches the legal age of 21?

Rick Cleveland
My guess would be Pittsburgh. And his Major League debut may come sooner than that.
Sunday afternoon, the Jackson Prep star, the No. 1 prospect in all of baseball, was promoted by the Pittsburgh Pirates from high-Class A Greensboro, North Carolina, to Class AA Altoona, Pennsylvania. On Tuesday night, he will be youngest player ever to play for the Altoona Curve  in the Eastern League. He doesn’t turn 20 until April 24, 2026.
“It’s a pretty awesome feeling,” Griffin said in a phone call Monday morning while en route from Greensboro to Altoona, a six-hour drive. “I got the news after the game Sunday when they called a team meeting and the manager told us.”
Making the news all the more exciting for Griffin was the promotion of of one of his best friends, catcher Derek Berg, from Greensboro to Altoona.  The 23-year-old Bird is on a much more traditional baseball career path, having played college baseball (at Army) for four seasons before being drafted in the 10th round of the 2024 Major League draft. In contrast, Griffin was playing for Jackson Prep in May, 2024.
“Derek’s a good friend. We were taken in the same draft together and have been together at Bradenton (low Class A) and Greensboro,” Griffin said. “It’s really neat we are taking this next step together.”
Even though the Pirates drafted Griffin with the ninth overall pick (first high school player chosen) of the 2024 draft, his rapid rise this spring and summer has been nothing short of astonishing, as have his statistics. In 50 games at Bradenton, he hit .338 with plenty of power. In 51 games at Greensboro, he hit .325. Combined, he has hit 16 home runs, 21 doubles and four triples. In the process, he has become a more disciplined hitter. His on-base percentage rose from .396 at low-A to .434 at high-A.
Add to all that Griffin’s combined 59 stolen bases and far above average fielding ability at both shortstop and centerfielder positions. Little wonder the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder last month was named the top MLB prospect in all of baseball.
“It’s been a heckuva year; the hard work is paying off,” Griffin said. 
Has his meteoric rise affected his timeline for making to the Major Leagues?
“I am just trying to live in the moment, not think about all that,” Griffin said. “My goal is to remain humble and continue the hard work that has gotten me to where I am. I just thank God for where he has taken me.”
The last Pittsburgh Pirate to make it to the Class AA level at 19 is Andrew McCutchen, who has since become a five-time All-Star and the National League MVP. In 2013, McCutchen, the 11th pick of the 2005 draft, made it to Altoona in 2006 at 19. He did not make his Big League debut until 2009 at age 22. He has since hit 330 home runs.

Griffin would appear to be advancing at faster rate. Nothing has seemed to faze him, including his ascension to No. 1 MLB prospect not quite a month ago. Even his father, Belhaven softball coach Kevin Griffin, expressed concern at the time that the No. 1 prospect designation would heap more pressure on his son, who only last year was playing high school baseball.
“I have tried not to let it add pressure, but there’s no doubt you have more eyes on you with something like that,” Konnor Griffin said. “I try to take it one step at a time, continue to work hard and give it everything I have.”
Altoona has an off day today before playing a home game Tuesday night against the Reading (Pennsylvania) Fighting Phils.
Griffin expects to remain primarily a shortstop, but also play centerfield on occasion. He was to learn more later Monday upon arrival in Altoona where he will meet with Curve manager Andy Fox, a former Major Leaguer who played for two World Series championship teams.
Said Griffin, who remains as grounded and mature as any 19-year-old I’ve encountered, “I just see it as another challenge and another chance to learn. I can’t wait.”

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.

The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.

John G. Rowland's pardon application will not be released to the public, consistent with longstanding policy.","The Trump administration is declining to release the application that former Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland made for the pardon of two federal convictions granted him by President Donald Trump in May.
The response to a freedom-of-information request by The Connecticut Mirror is consistent with a longstanding policy that applications and supporting documents may be released, but they generally are not.
“Please be advised that a search has been conducted in the Office of the Pardon Attorney but no responsive records subject to the Freedom of Information Act were located,” the Office of the Pardon Attorney said in response to CT Mirror.
The Justice Department says the president and his immediate staff are exempt from the Freedom of Information and Privacy acts, a combination that means the White House is not required to release pardon files but has the discretion to do so.
Trump has been generous in offering pardons, granting more since returning to the White House in January than most presidents recorded over the entirety of their terms.
Rowland’s pardon was among the 1,600 issued by Trump in the first six months of his second term, most coming on the first day, when he pardoned more than 1,500 rioters convicted of assault on police officers and other crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
By contrast, Trump had granted only one of the 421 pardons requested during the first 8 1/2 months of his first term, and 144 of 1,969 requested over his full four years. His successor, Joe Biden, granted 80 of the 1,666 requests over four years, including one for his son, Hunter Biden.
The Office of the Pardon Attorney lists statistics on pardons and clemency grants for every president from William McKinley through Biden.
Facing impeachment and a federal investigation into bid-rigging involving gifts and favors from state contractors, Rowland resigned July 1, 2004 at nearly the midpoint of his third term. He pleaded guilty to a corruption charge on Dec. 23, 2004. He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison, ultimately serving 10 months. 
He was indicted a second time in 2014, accused of soliciting congressional candidates in 2010 and 2012 to secretly pay him as a consultant in campaigns for his old 5th Congressional District seat in violation of campaign finance laws. He was convicted and sentenced to 30 months in prison.
Given that the 68-year-old Rowland had completed his sentences, the practical impact of the pardon for him was limited. Under Connecticut law, his right to vote already had been restored. 
As the Justice Department notes, a pardon is an expression of forgiveness and does not expunge a criminal record, though it can lift some barriers to employment, housing and education.
“I am very humbled and appreciative,” Rowland said via email after being pardoned in May. “I have been blessed with a wonderful family and friends that have been through a great deal over the years. This is a wonderful final resolution.”
Instructions on seeking a pardon advise that petitioners, and anyone submitting testimony in support, can expect a degree of privacy.
“Non-public documents, such as this petition and supporting documents, the presentence investigation report, the results of any federal background investigation, and the recommendation of the Department of Justice are not generally available under the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts.”
The instructions warn, however, that the privacy is not guaranteed: “[W]hile pardon-related documents in the possession of the White House traditionally have not been made public, they may be legally disclosed at the discretion of the President.
“In addition, pardon-related documents retained by the White House at the end of a presidential administration will become part of the President’s official library, where they become subject to the disclosure provisions of the Presidential Records Act.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_3192.jpg,,,2025-08-18 13:56:56.867223

As lawmakers weigh courts’ decisions on accessing public land, an advocacy group suggests revisions to a draft bill.
The post Hunters want ‘affirmative’ public access in corner crossing bill appeared first on WyoFile .","A public-access group is asking lawmakers to make several changes in a proposed corner-crossing bill when the lawmakers meet Aug. 19 in Casper to consider the draft legislation.
Now that a federal appeals court has ruled that corner crossing is legal in the checkerboard area of Wyoming, some legislators want state law to reflect that decision. Enacting a new law could eliminate confusion regarding the court ruling, which involves lengthy, complex legal arguments.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping diagonally from one piece of public land to another where they meet with two pieces of private property. Corner crossers do not set foot on private land, but they do pass through the airspace above it.
The draft bill under consideration on Aug. 19 by the Joint Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Interim Committee says what corner crossing is not — a trespass. Backcountry Hunters and Anglers urged legislators to write and consider a different version establishing corner crossing as an affirmative right.
“We should not be threatened nor charged with trespass if a toe were to inadvertently touch private land.” Backcountry Hunters and Anglers
The draft bill to be debated in Casper — “Corner crossing clarification” — “suggests more of a ‘negative’ right,” BHA states in comments filed with the committee. The bill would say corner crossing is not trespassing under laws grouped under the titles of “crimes and offenses” and “Game and fish.”
Instead, BHA suggested another measure be written as an “affirmative” bill under the “state lands” title of Wyoming laws. The group pointed to a bill drafted in 2011 as a model. The bill did not become law.
“The language of the 2011 [bill] establishes an ‘affirmative’ right to access,” the BHA wrote. A similar measure today would clarify that “Wyoming’s public land users have the right and the ability to access our public land, and then ensures that in doing so we would not be subject to trespass charges when lawfully accessing public land.”
2020 eruption
The conflict over corner crossing erupted in southern Wyoming in 2020 where land ownership is patterned like a checkerboard of alternating public and public property. That’s when four Missouri hunters corner crossed to hunt public land surrounded by the Elk Mountain Ranch.
Carbon County Sheriff’s Office cited the four for trespass, but a jury found them not guilty. Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman also sued Brad Cape and his three friends in civil court in 2022 for trespassing.
Courts ruled against Eshelman, saying an 1885 law prevented him from blocking the hunters’ access. Eshelman has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case and overrule the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision against him.
Looking for new Wyoming legislation, the hunters’ group also recommended other changes to the committee’s draft bill, including allowing incidental trespass in cases where landowners have not surveyed their property but pursue trespass charges nevertheless.

“The choice of a private landowner to not [survey] cannot be used as a reason to keep public land owners off public land,” the group wrote lawmakers. “If we do our part by properly accessing public land at the corner where the two parcels meet, we should not be threatened nor charged with trespass if a toe were to inadvertently touch private land in the process.”
BHA also believes the committee’s draft bill should not include language about property damage.
“By adding property damage into these sections, the Legislature would be conflating property damages with criminal trespass,” the hunters say. “These are two different crimes, and should likely be handled separately.”
The group wants the committee to consider drafting a second bill and postponing final action on the current bill until lawmakers meet again in November. The committee could then discuss both options, BHA said.
By November’s meeting there may be more developments regarding Eshelman’s Supreme Court petition, BHA said. It is possible the U.S. Supreme Court will have decided by November whether to take up the case or simply let the 10th Circuit decision stand.
Sheriff Bakken to follow law
As hunting season began Friday, the Carbon County sheriff said he will follow the appeals court’s OK of corner crossing. Sheriff Alex Bakken’s office cited the hunters in 2021 for trespassing even though they did not set foot on Eshelman’s ranch.
Bakken posted a community update on Facebook on the opening day of archery season that outlines his department’s policy. “One of the most common questions we have been receiving from the hunting public is how we are handling corner-crossing,” the sheriff wrote.
“Until further clarification is received, the Carbon County Sheriff’s Office will be operating under the United States Court of Appeals-10th Circuit Decision in the case of Iron Bar Holdings v. Cape,” Bakken wrote.
Iron Bar Holdings LLC is the name of Eshelman’s company that officially owns the 20,000-acre-plus ranch on the wildlife-rich Elk Mountain.
Bakken stopped short of describing what corner crossing is or where the ruling applies, instead providing a link to the court’s decision. In that 49-page decision reached in March, a three-judge panel stated “Iron Bar cannot implement a program which has the effect of denying access to federal public lands for lawful purposes.”

After reporters found dozens of firms hiding privacy tools from search results, US senator Maggie Hassan insisted the companies explain their practices—and pledge to improve access to privacy controls.


This story is copublished with WIRED.
United States senator Maggie Hassan is pressing major data brokers after an investigation by The Markup/CalMatters and copublished by WIRED found at least 35 firms hid opt-out information from search results, making it harder for people to take control of their own data and safeguard their privacy online.
Hassan, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, put five of the top firms—IQVIA Digital, Comscore, Telesign Corporation, 6sense Insights and Findem—on notice Wednesday, demanding that each explain why code on their sites appears designed to frustrate deletion requests.
None of the companies immediately responded to WIRED’s request for comment. None previously responded to requests for comment during the investigation.
California law requires brokers to provide a way to delete personal data; however, the investigation found dozens of registered brokers obscuring their opt-out tools by hiding them from Google and other search results. Consumer advocates called it a “clever work-around” that undermines privacy rights and may qualify as an illegal dark pattern—a design decision that, according to California’s privacy regulator, erodes consumer “autonomy, decision making, or choice when asserting their privacy rights or consenting.”
Hassan wants the firms to justify the placement of their opt‑out pages; acknowledge whether they used code to block search indexing and, if so, against how many users; pledge to remove any such code by September 3; and provide Congress with recent audit results and steps taken since the investigation, if any, to improve user access.
“Data brokers and other online providers have a responsibility to prevent the misuse of consumer data, and Americans deserve to understand if and how their personal information is being used,” Hassan wrote, citing other tactics variously employed by the firms—forcing users to scroll through multiple screens, dismiss needless pop-ups and hunt for links in shrunken text.
Behind the scenes, data brokers fuel a multibillion-dollar industry that trades in detailed personal information—often gathered without a person’s knowledge or consent. They compile sprawling dossiers often packed with precise location histories, political leanings and religious affiliations, then sell and resell those profiles, powering everything from hyper‑targeted ads to law‑enforcement surveillance.
Even among the small share of Americans who know this surveillance ecosystem exists, fewer still grasp its true scale—or the ways it can shape, influence, or intrude on their lives.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration quietly abandoned a proposed rule that would have sharply limited brokers’ collection and sale of Americans’ data by treating certain brokers as “consumer reporting agencies” under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. At the same time, contract documents show the US intelligence community is preparing a centralized marketplace to streamline purchases of commercially available data—giving agencies shared access to large repositories of sensitive information without the court orders otherwise required for traditional surveillance.
For survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, the risks are acute. The National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project warns that data brokers collect and sell vast amounts of information that can put survivors at risk, adding that opting out is already a burdensome, piecemeal process, forcing people to contact companies one by one, navigate hard-to-find forms and resubmit deletion requests regularly as information is re-collected and re-listed.
“Instead of requiring people to navigate byzantine labyrinths to protect their personal information, these companies have a responsibility to make the tools that allow Americans to exercise their right to privacy easy to find and use,” Hassan told WIRED.
Sean Vitka, the executive director of Demand Progress, a nonprofit advocacy group critical of the industry, compared the surveillance ecosystem underlying commercial data markets to the knotted tails of a rat king—an inseparable tangle of entities sustained by unchecked data flows. “The damage done by data brokers manifests in countless ways,” he said, “but it’s all enabled by the same predatory abuse of consumers’ data.”
“And consistent with what we’re seeing here, the industry cannot be trusted to mitigate its own harms.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/021925-Maggie-Hassan-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 13:56:56.867223

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.

Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu.

“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
 Exacerbating disparities

Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
 Not just COVID-19

In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.













The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council





The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

(Photo via Getty Images)Health insurance-related tasks are so time-intensive and complex that many clinicians and claims processors in New Mexico are blaming them for compromising patient care and driving health care workers out of the field, according to the authors of a forthcoming study commissioned by the state Legislative Council Service.
Doctors and nurses reported spending at least three to four hours per week on billing tasks, according to the report produced by two researchers at the University of New Mexico Center for Social Policy. The pair is set to present the report Tuesday during a legislative meeting. 
Center for Social Policy Executive Director Gabriel Sanchez and Research Assistant Professor Melanie Sonntag in May and June conducted focus groups and interviews with 31 clinicians and other workers who determine whether insurance will cover care, Sonntag told Source NM.
Participants, who are not identified by their names or workplaces in the study, told the researchers a lot of their time is wasted by prior authorization, which is when a health care provider must get permission from an insurance company before either seeing a patient or administering a treatment, Sonntag said in an interview on Tuesday.
A clinician who participated in the study told Sonntag they spend up to half of their time with each patient just doing documentation and prior authorization, she said. Another physician in emergency medicine told her they try to see as many patients as possible and use their time outside clinical hours to handle billing and insurance tasks, which others have warned will burn them out.
“This is time that could be spent with patients,” Sonntag said. “It’s really frustrating for patients and clinicians that they can’t spend that much time with patients to address their health concerns and are instead spending a lot of time on these administrative tasks.”
Sanchez and Sonntag concluded that there needs to be deep structural change to ensure that people can receive proper health care and that clinicians don’t get burnt out and leave, she said.
“The discussions we had with healthcare professionals suggest that the system is in need of significant revision that may not be possible without considering moving to another model,” they wrote in the study, according to a news release last week from the Health Security for New Mexicans Campaign, a group that advocates for affordable health care.
Sonntag said one structural change she thinks makes sense would be the campaign’s proposal called the Health Security Act, which would  provide health insurance for about 1.8 million of New Mexico’s 2 million residents, or everyone except for federal retirees and members of the military. Under the proposal, the insurance pool would be funded by the premiums workers and employers already pay to private insurance companies.
“They’re really trying to design something that works for our state, and we know New Mexico has our own challenges and ways we like to address things,” Sonntag said.
That legislation was most recently introduced to the Legislature in 2019 but didn’t pass. Another bill that would have tasked the state Office of the Superintendent of Insurance with studying the issue also died in 2022.
The idea has met opposition at the Roundhouse from the state chapter of the National Association of Benefits and Insurance Professionals. Proponents of the legislation have included the New Mexico Medical Society, the professional organization for physicians in the state. Source NM sent requests for comment to both organizations and will update this story as needed.
It’s already well-documented that the United States spends an increasing amount of money on administrative tasks in health care, and more on health care overall than comparable countries, Sonntag said. But the upcoming study illuminates how prior authorizations and the billing cycle make it even more difficult for health care providers in rural areas to care for patients when they’re already dealing with insurance companies denying claims because people are “out-of-network.”
The two researchers are slated to present their findings to the interim Legislative Health and Human Services Committee in Gallup on Aug. 19. Legislative committee meetings between sessions can sometimes, but not always, lead to a lawmaker introducing a specific legislation proposal.
“This is like every academic’s dream but I’m hoping to accomplish system-level change,” Sonntag said about the study. “I think it would be amazing to really reform the system to make sure that health care can be patient-centered.”

In the complaint, the Chippewa Cree Indians of the Rocky Boy’s Reservation and a couple of  tribal members are suing the county, the commissioners, and the clerk and recorder alleging the county’s at-large elections are unlawful.
The plaintiffs want the U.S. District Court’s Great Falls Division to find Chouteau County’s at-large elections for its three commissioners don’t comply with the Voting Rights Act.
They also want the court to implement a redistricting plan that doesn’t dilute the Native American vote.
The complaint requests the court order a plan “that provides at least one Native American voting-age majority single-member commissioner district that effectively performs for the Native American candidate of choice.”
In a statement provided by the ACLU of Montana, Chippewa Cree Tribe Chairman Harlan Gopher said it’s time for the county to respect the rights of its Native voters.
“We’re filing this lawsuit because Chouteau County continues to hold elections in which the Native votes don’t count,” Gopher said in a statement. “The Chippewa Cree Tribe filed this lawsuit to prevent this local government from trampling on the civil rights of our people. A fair redistricting process must respect the boundaries and voice of our Nation.”
The Native American Rights Fund and ACLU Foundation also are representing the plaintiffs.
The Chouteau County Attorney was out of the office Friday and unavailable for comment until Monday; he could not be reached Monday morning before publication.
The complaint said Montana law requires at-large elections unless a court orders otherwise, and Chouteau County meets the conditions for a claim of vote dilution under the Voting Rights Act.
Those conditions are that the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; that the minority group be politically cohesive; and that the majority vote usually defeat the minority’s preferred candidate, the lawsuit said.
“Native Americans in the county are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority of the voting-age population in one single-member district,” the lawsuit said.
  (Screenshot from complaint)
The county overlaps with roughly one third of the reservation, the lawsuit said. It said in the county, 25.8% of the population is Native American (“alone or in combination”), as is 20.71% of the voting-age population.
But “to plaintiffs’ knowledge, no Native American has been elected to the Board of Commissioners nor to any other countywide office for at least the past ten years,” the lawsuit said.
The results mean Native Americans in the state and Chouteau County continue to experience the effects of discrimination, tribal members allege.
“Native Americans have a lower socioeconomic status and lag behind non-Hispanic white residents in a wide range of areas, including employment, income, education and access to health care,” the lawsuit said.
Ken Morsette, a plaintiff and member of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, said Native voters need a fair election system, and they need the ability to elect a commissioner who understands Native issues and is willing to collaborate with the tribe.
“The three local representatives currently in power do little that benefits the Native taxpayers in this part of Montana and adopted a system that prevents us from being able to vote them out,” Morsette said in a statement provided by the ACLU of Montana. “Until our votes matter, too, we’re stuck under their thumb.”
The lawsuit said the tribe notified commissioners in November 2023 that at-large elections were in violation of the Voting Rights Act, and the tribe offered to work with the county on a solution “to avoid unnecessary expense to the county’s taxpayers.”
The tribe wanted to create a district map with commissioners that complied with the Voting Rights Act and could be jointly submitted to Montana’s federal district court for approval, the lawsuit said.
  (Screenshot from complaint)
On Dec. 5, 2023, legal counsel for the tribe met with commissioners, the county clerk and the county attorney “to discuss a simple resolution,” and the tribe’s counsel followed up by email on Dec. 11, 2023, and again on Jan. 19, 2024, according to the complaint.
“To date, the county has not responded to the Tribe’s proposal,” the lawsuit said.
As such, the complaint said the court’s intervention is necessary. 
The lawsuit also argues the “totality of the circumstances” supports the plaintiffs’ claim they have less opportunity to participate in electing commissioners.
For one thing, it said, Montana has a “long and well-documented history of voting discrimination” against Native Americans, including that it passed a law as soon as it became a territory to limit voting to “white male citizens.”
It said legislators have continued attempts to restrict Native Americans from voting in Montana in the current day, and tribal members are boxed out of decisions in the county.
“To Plaintiffs’ knowledge, the county has never consulted the Chippewa Cree Tribal Council on policy decisions that affect the tribe,” the lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit asks the court to permanently stop the county from conducting at-large elections and order it to implement a plan that protects the rights of the Native American voters.
“Fair representation isn’t just about numbers on a map — it’s about the dignity of knowing our voices count,” said plaintiff and voter Tanya Schmockel, of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, in a statement. “Without that, we remain invisible in decisions that affect every part of our lives. This case is about making sure our community finally has the same say in who serves as commissioner as every other voter in the county.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3521-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 13:56:56.867223

(Courtesy of Applied Digital) Applied Digital, the company operating data centers near Ellendale and Jamestown, on Monday announced plans to build a $3 billion data center at Harwood, north of Fargo. 
Applied Digital plans to break ground in September on what it calls Polaris Forge 2, a  280-megawatt artificial intelligence computing center. 
The plan calls for two facilities with room for expansion. Applied Digital has contracted more than 900 acres for its campus and secured power through Cass County Electric Cooperative, a member-owned nonprofit. The data center is expected to employ more than 200 full-time workers, in addition to long-term contractors.
Applied Digital said in a news release that it is expanding in North Dakota because the state has abundant energy, available land and a pro-business climate.
“The demand for AI capacity continues to accelerate, and North Dakota continues to be one of the most strategic locations in the country to meet that need,” Wes Cummins, CEO of Applied Digital, said in the news release. 
Harwood is a town of about 800 people north of Fargo along Interstate 29. 
“Applied Digital’s investment reflects confidence in our people and our potential, and we’re proud to be part of this moment,” Harwood Mayor Blake Hankey said in the news release.
AI driving data center demand at accelerating pace 

Applied Digital has invested in housing and other infrastructure in Ellendale, a town of about 1,100 near the South Dakota state line, where it operates Polaris Forge 1.
“North Dakota wins when companies like Applied Digital choose to be more than an employer.” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in the news release. “In Ellendale, they invested in people through workforce housing and created strong local partnerships that strengthen the community.” 
Applied Digital data centers house banks of computers owned by tech companies that provide artificial intelligence and other services. 
The tech companies lease space from Applied Digital, which builds climate-controlled facilities to keep the computers cool, clean and operating efficiently.
Data centers use tremendous amounts of power, which will be supplied by Cass County Electric Cooperative, a member of Grand Forks-based Minnkota Power Cooperative. 
“Our focus is on making sure it is integrated in a way that strengthens our communities, supports reliable and responsible power, and builds on the strong foundation we have established through more than 85 years of service to this region,” Mac McLennan, Minnkota Power Cooperative president and CEO said in the news release.

Nick Phillips, executive vice president of Applied Digital who works from the Ellendale campus, spoke last week in Fargo at an artificial intelligence summit organized by the Fargo Moorhead West Fargo Chamber. 
He said data centers are beneficial to communities, providing good jobs for people in the skilled trades, such as electricians, and adding to the tax base.

Applied Digital, with a campus just outside of Ellendale, requested to be annexed into the town to increase tax revenue for Ellendale.
At the same Summit, U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak said North Dakota’s ability to provide power and a home for data centers is important for national security. 
“Where I see incredible opportunity for North Dakota is using that resource, the incredible energy resources we have to help provide the power to develop this incredible industry here in America, not over in India and China,” she said.

Bowyer admitted to operating an illegal gambling business, money laundering, and filing a false tax return. He failed to report more than $4 million in income in one tax year, according to the government’s motion to the judge, filed Friday, to impose a sentence outside federal guidelines.
Bowyer’s business “placed and accepted bets on sporting events for its clients, and employed agents and sub-agents, including casino hosts, who referred and recruited clients, demanded and collected on bettors’ losses and distributed winnings, and were paid a portion of the losses bettors incurred and paid,” says the government’s motion.
The proposed sentence, scheduled to be imposed next week, is far less than the 41 to 51 months calculated in the government’s presentence report, and rewards Bowyer for his lack of criminal history and “substantial assistance to the government,” including in its prosecution of Ohtani’s interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, and fellow bookie Damien LeForbes.
Mizuhara is serving a 57-month sentence for stealing $17 million from Ohtani. LeForbes is awaiting sentencing for operating an unlawful gambling business and money laundering.  
Bowyer’s information “contributed to the government’s ability to interpret recovered text messages and execute a search warrant on Leforbes in December 2023,” the motion says, adding he provided additional information in January 2024. 
LeForbes declined to comment on the record on the revelation that Bowyer cooperated against him. 
“I met with Matt Bowyer over a year ago and he said he told his lawyer he wasn’t giving up his players or his friends, just the dirty casino executives,” high stakes gambler Robert (R.J.) Cipriani, who worked as a confidential source for the government, said Monday. 
LeForbes, Bowyer, and another gambler lost an estimated $24 million, much of it laundered gambling proceeds, at Resorts World Las Vegas. 
The Current was first to report two years ago that federal authorities out of California were investigating allegations that gamblers with questionable sources of income were gambling at Resorts World and MGM Grand. 
MGM paid a $7.45 million fine as part of a non-prosecution agreement with the feds, and paid $8.5 million to Nevada regulators. Resorts World paid a $10.5 million fine to the Nevada Gaming Commission. An anticipated nonprosecution agreement between federal prosecutors and Resorts World has yet to materialize. 
“It’s unconscionable that two bookies are likely going to jail yet the Resorts World executives who got caught up in it move down the street to another casino,” Cipriani said. 
Bowyer, the government says, has accepted responsibility for his conduct and is making restitution on unpaid taxes as part of his plea agreement. His sentencing is scheduled for next week.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/resorts-world_exterior_hero-expanded-1-e1723756620194-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-18 12:58:15.399001

Patrick Morrisey’s executive order allowing religious exemptions to the state’s strict school vaccination requirements. 
The organizations refiled the complaint Friday in Kanawha County Circuit Court. They originally filed the lawsuit May 23 on behalf of Marisa Jackson, of Kanawha County, and Dr. Joshua Hess, of Cabell County. Jackson and Hess are both parents of immunocompromised students. Hess is also a pediatric hematologist and oncologist practicing at Marshall Health’s Cabell Huntington Hospital. 
It names as defendants the state Department of Health, Bureau for Public Health along with Justin Davis, interim commissioner for public health and Arvin Singh, the state’s cabinet secretary for the health department. 
In July, Kanawha Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard dismissed the lawsuit for procedural reasons, agreeing with an attorney for the state who argued that the organization failed to give the 30-days notice required by state law when suing a governmental agency. 
In the refiled complaint, the organizations note that the judge originally dismissed the lawsuit because of its failure to “adequately articulate a claim for injunctive relief” rather than a deficiency with its constitutional claims.  
“This action is now ripe for re-filing with pleadings that cure the procedural deficiencies identified by the court,” they write. “The underlying constitutional violations that prompted the original litigation remain unaddressed and continue to cause ongoing harm. Additionally, Plaintiffs/Petitioners have gained substantial insight into the unconstitutional manner in which 
Defendants/Respondents are interpreting and applying the relevant statutory provisions,  strengthening both the factual foundation and legal theories supporting this renewed challenge.” 
In a news release Monday, the organizations said they’re seeking emergency relief to protect students as the new school year begins. 
“Time is running out to protect West Virginia’s schoolchildren from a dangerous and unconstitutional policy,” ACLU-WV Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in the news release. “While our previous case was dismissed on procedural grounds, the core of this issue is clear: What the state is doing violates the law and the West Virginia Constitution. We’re asking the court to act immediately before more children are put at risk.”
“This isn’t just about policy — it’s about protecting real children who will be sitting in classrooms next week,” Mountain State Justice Director Sarah Brown said in the news release. “Gov. Morrisey is gambling with children’s lives to score political points. We’ve seen what happens in other states when vaccine requirements are weakened, and we won’t let that happen here in West Virginia.”
The ACLU’s lawsuit is at least the second lawsuit filed in regards to the question of Morrisey’s executive order and the state’s school vaccination requirements. Morrisey’s executive order is still in place after the Legislature this year voted down a bill that would have inscribed religious exemptions into state code. 
A Raleigh County judge last month ruled in favor of the parents of three students who were issued a religious exemption to the vaccination requirements and sued the state Board of Education for instructing school boards not to accept the exemptions. 
Morrisey has argued the state’s school vaccination law should be read alongside the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act to mean that families should get religious exemptions to the immunizations.
As West Virginia students head back to the classroom for the year, rules about vaccination requirements may vary by school.
The state Board of Education has not changed its guidance that public schools should accept only medical exemptions to vaccines. 
The governor’s executive order does not apply to private schools, leaving them to decide whether to follow state law or the executive order. 
The West Virginia Professional Charter Schools Board earlier this month voted to tell the state’s seven charter schools to follow the executive order and accept religious vaccination exemptions. That action led the state Board of Education last week to send a letter to the charter school board instructing it to follow the state’s school vaccination law, not the executive order. 
Morrisey and the state Department of Health did not immediately return an email seeking comment. 
In a post on the social media platform X last week, Morrisey promised that families seeking religious exemptions would win either in court or through legislative action. 
‘Hold strong. I recognize that the Board [of Education] is creating hardships for families but we will keep pushing,” he wrote.

(Getty Images)Glencoe Public Schools filed a suit in Payne County District Court Thursday against the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association over its decision to disallow some students from playing basketball due to an alleged rule violation.


According to the lawsuit, the OSSAA says the students violated Rule 24, also known as the “Linked Rule,” a controversial provision intended to keep students from transferring from following a coach to a new school district.
Three of the four named students in the lawsuit attended a team camp in May at Glencoe with Coach Garrett Schubert. The students later applied through the transfer portal when it opened in June.
But, according to the lawsuit, OSSAA said the students should have unenrolled from their previous districts first.
Glencoe’s attorney, Hannah Whitten with the firm Whitten Burrage, said there is no OSSAA provision requiring that.
“There’s been no requirement to unenroll your kid before the school year starts and before the transfer portals open,” Whitten said. “So they did everything to the letter of the law.”
The plaintiffs appealed OSSAA’s decision at a Wednesday hearing, but the Board of Directors voted unanimously to uphold its ruling.
The suit requests an order from the court determining the OSSAA’s ruling to be unreasonable, as well as a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction against OSSAA’s enforcement of the rule on the students.
The plaintiffs in the suit are the student athletes’ families, Glencoe Public Schools and Coach Garrett Schubert.
Plaintiffs have submitted sworn testimony that no recruiting occured. Whitten also said OSSAA released guidance on May 20 that said summer participation before June 1 would not affect student eligibility.
Rule 24 has been the target of Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond. Drummond ordered the organization to end its enforcement in September. In response, OSSAA temporarily suspended its enforcement of the rule.
Lawmakers voiced support for the students in a Thursday news release.
“Oklahomans believe in fairness and opportunity. OSSAA’s decision here undermines both, and it’s why the Legislature must look closely at reforming how these decisions are made,” Sen. Avery Frix (R-Muskogee) said.
In a statement to StateImpact, Gov. Kevin Stitt urged the OSSAA to reconsider its position and let the students compete.
“When I fought for open transfer, it was to ensure that every student in Oklahoma had equal opportunity to succeed. For many students, athletics are an essential part of a well-rounded education,” Stitt said. “It is disappointing that OSSAA would continue to perpetuate a system that bars students from the opportunity to compete — especially when many students rely on the opportunity athletics provides to pursue higher education.”
A spokesperson for OSSAA declined to comment, citing the litigation.

Fagan Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, will leave his post Jan. 5 to become the next president and CEO of the Abell Foundation, according to a statement issued by the philanthropic nonprofit.
“Fagan shares the Abell Foundation’s steadfast commitment to the people of Baltimore, and he will honor our organization’s legacy while leading the next chapter of our work,” Christy Wyskiel, chair of the Abell Foundation Board of Trustees, said in a statement Monday.

“Abell has spent decades investing in Baltimore – its people, its neighborhoods and its future, and Fagan shares our unwavering belief in the potential of Baltimore,” her statement said.
A spokesperson for Moore did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.
Talk of Harris’ departure — specifically to the Abell Foundation — has circulated for weeks.
Harris, 38, grew up in Bowie and in Anne Arundel County, and attended local public schools.
After graduating from Stanford University, Harris, like Moore, became a Rhodes Scholar. That connection led to Moore later becoming a mentor.
He and Moore launched Baltimore Corps in 2013, a nonprofit employment and grant-making agency.
The organization connects overlooked job seekers with positions in public service, nonprofits and the private sector. During the pandemic, the nonprofit focued on recruitment in the city’s public health workforce.
Moore tapped Harris as his chief of staff in 2022, soon after the election.
Harris will succeed Robert C. “Bob” Embry Jr. in leading the Abell Foundation. Embry joined the nonprofit in 1987.

(David Stephenson/Kentucky Lantern)SHELBYVILLE, Kentucky – A Kentucky church is urging its members to permanently remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
Pamela Wilson Federspiel, who has been director of the library in downtown Shelbyville for 34 years, says the action is tantamount to “stealing.”
But three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville defend what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”

  Austin Keeler
“Yes — we have urged Christians, both locally and across the country, to search their libraries for books that promote sodomy, gender confusion and rebellion against God — and if found, to check them out and never return them as an act of civil disobedience,” pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions, recently told the Lantern in an email.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out last year with due dates in late June 2024, said Federspiel. Some of the books were written for children, some for adults. (The list of books is at the bottom of this story.)
Federspiel did not identify the library patron and said the books were never returned after several notices.
The titles include “The Art of Drag,” “My Two Moms” and “My Two Dads.”
Chris Hartman of Louisville, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said he has never considered “theft to be a form of civil action.”
He also said he has never heard of a church encouraging its members “to steal from a public institution. It is shameful, unfortunate and disrespectful.”
Such activity often backfires by making people, especially young people, curious about the books and giving them more attention, he said.
  Author Sarah Prager
Sarah Prager of Boston wrote one of the 16 books the Shelby County Public Library has “lost.” It is called “Kind Like Marsha: Lessons from LGBTQ+ Leaders”  and  is for juveniles. Amazon.com says it celebrates 14 LGBTQ+ people throughout history, like politician Harvey Milk, scientist and painter Leonardo da Vinci, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Marsha P. Johnson, who took care of her trans community on the streets of New York City.
“My book is not about sexual acts. It is about real, caring people — and what is wrong about that? A library must always have a diverse inventory.  We can never let that change,” Prager said.
Complaints about books increase
The church posted its recommendation to check out certain library books and not return them in a 2 minute, 57 second video on its Facebook page on June 1, 2024.  Church leaders said recently their message has not changed.
“Friends, the Shelby County Public Library is promoting the vile LGBTQ agenda to groom and trans children in Kentucky,” a script accompanying the video says.
“Would you help us expose what’s happening here?” it asks before providing contact information for two library officials and listing books the church found objectionable.
Complaints about books to public libraries are not new but are growing in Kentucky and the United States. There were 302 challenges to Kentucky public libraries in 2024, up from only 26 in 2023, according to the state Department of Libraries and Archives annual Statistical Report of Kentucky Public Libraries released in April.
But rare, if ever, is the practice condoned by the Shelbyville church for making books disappear from the shelves.
“Strategically checking out books with no plans to return them as a method of permanently removing certain books from local public libraries is not a common practice, at least not one that has been reported to KDLA,” said Jill Midkiff, a spokesperson for the  Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet and the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives (KDLA).
  Suzanne Trimel
PEN America, based in New York, tracks book bans and fights censorship across the country. Spokesperson Suzanne Trimel said she has never heard of the  book-removal tactic recommended by the Shelbyville church, though some conservative churches have urged members to seek public office to be in a position to censor LGBTQ+ books. She’s also heard of hiding controversial books where they aren’t likely to be found on library shelves
PEN America has seen censorship activities in public schools and public libraries intensify, she said, as public libraries have responded to pressure by canceling author visits and drag story hours.
Trimel said public libraries also have been under pressure from the “Hide the Pride” campaign, largely led  by a conservative Catholic advocacy organization called CatholicVote.  In 2022, the leaders of CatholicVote estimated 50 to 100 libraries were targeted for “Hide the Pride.”
The campaign instructs parents to go to the children’s section of a public library and check out all “Pride Month” books on the display shelves. The parents return the books on time but place them on other shelves out of reach of children.
The Reformation Church of Shelbyville does not return controversial books removed from the Shelby County library.
The church’s stance
Pastor Dorris said the church became aware of the controversial books when a member took their children to the library and the “children were exposed to some of them. Upon investigation they discovered the remaining books.”
Like librarian Federspiel, Dorris declined to identify the patron. He said the family did not want any public attention. Records of books checked out by patrons of public libraries are not subject to Kentucky’s Open Records Act, said Amye Bensenhaver, co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.

Dorris said he is uncertain where the checked-out books are now. “They have not been destroyed to my knowledge.”
He said his independent church, which “shepherds 357 souls,” is taking a “public stand against sexual perversion being pushed upon children through taxpayer-funded institutions.” It will continue to take that stand without apology, he said.
“This is not literacy — it’s grooming,” Dorris said.
Asked about the removal of public property, Dorris said, “We reject the idea that civil rebellion is only legitimate when it’s done with rainbow flags or Marxist slogans. Civil disobedience is a biblical category when obedience to God and love for neighbor demand it.”
Dorris said that when the church discovered the controversial materials in the local library, it contacted Shelby County’s state senator and representative. It also contacted the library’s staff and its board members “to express our deep concern and call for action.”
“No library staff or board member ever followed up with us, no request has been made for the return of these books, and — tellingly — the books themselves have not been replaced. Not that we would return them — but the silence itself speaks volumes,” said Dorris.
Matt Burgin, president of the library’s board of trustees, said Federspiel told the board about the situation but no one else has ever contacted him about the books.
The library has handled it like other cases of overdue books, he said.

Dorris said he did talk to then-state Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, but he would not divulge their conversation. She could not be reached for comment. State Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, did not return phone calls to her Frankfort office seeking comment.
Dorris stressed that the book action is not a formal position of the Reformation Church and “not every member of our church is aware of and agrees with these actions, and that’s acceptable. We don’t discipline or pressure members over strategy. These actions — like the permanent removal of library books — were taken by individual Christians under personal conviction. We support their right to act or refrain in good conscience.”
The library’s stance
The 16 books director Federspiel says are “lost” due to the efforts of the Reformation Church range in cost from $19.99 to $35.
The library offers a variety of books for a diverse community, she said. “All are library property.”
Library materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons, said Federspiel, who declined to have her photo taken for this article. “The library is committed to providing materials that meet patron needs. Materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons. Replacing lost material is costly.”
Amanda Perry-Davis, the library’s collection manager, said the library acquires books generally based on their popularity. That can be determined by various book reviews, journals and magazines. Library professional journals recommended the “lost books” as appropriate titles for each age level.
Patrons also suggest specific books to acquire, said Perry-Davis.
Federspiel, who is retiring at the end of the year, said several staffers also provide their input on what books to buy but the final decision is hers.

Federspiel said that most of the “lost books” had not been in high demand by library patrons. 
The library left a voicemail message with the patron about the overdue books and issued three other notices before turning the matter over to a collection agency, Unique Management, after 60 days, she said. The replacement cost is added to the patron’s card but so far the books remain missing.
Church has other targets besides library
The church has engaged in more public protests, including against a now closed Shelbyville bar and a fall fundraiser in Cynthiana in which people dress up as witches.
The church protested The Barrel Room, formerly a bar in downtown Shelbyville, for holding drag shows and the city’s conference center for allowing “drag queens to dance in front of children.”The church branded Cynthiana “a hotbed of witchcraft” in response to the Harrison County seat’s Witches’ Day Out event.
“These displays grieve the heart of God and signal our community’s descent into spiritual decay,” said Pastor Dorris. “We do not hate the men who perform in drag, nor the librarians, nor the critics who accuse us of being hateful. We love them enough to tell the truth — that Jesus Christ is Lord, that sin leads to hell, and that the gospel alone can set people free.”
The Barrel Room closed in October. Vicki Jones Lee, a local gay rights advocate, said she saw several drag shows there. “We would hear the protesters outside, making a lot of noise. The shows would just go on,” she said.
A spokesperson for the conference center said the center became the site for a Pride event in the summer of 2023 “to help it find a public venue.

James Smith, executive director of the Cynthiana-Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, said “Witches Day Out” is part of the community’s annual Halloween festivities. Participants dress like witches and try to raise money for a needy cause such as helping a family whose child had brain cancer
“It’s not a cult, it’s not a religion. Cynthiana’s Witches Day Out is a fun, community event with 130-plus vendors, food, readings, and a Victorian seance-themed Crystal Ball on the first Saturday in September in downtown Cynthiana to kick off the fall season,” said committee member Sam Lunger.
“But it is disappointing to hear anyone say it involves witchcraft. Everyone is entitled to free speech but this is misleading and out of bounds. We do provide a free space for the church protesters.”
Drag shows and witches are taboo to the church but it has given most attention to books.
Consequences
Dorris, the pastor, expects “some sort of reaction against the church” for its book removal efforts but does not know exactly what that will be.
“We know there will be consequences for saying what others are afraid to say. We will not be silent. We will not comply. We will not flinch. Our duty is to God, and our aim is the good of our neighbors — even those who revile us,” he said.
Madison Markham, a staff member on PEN America’s Freedom to Read team, said, “The alarming rise of book bans and censorship in the country is and will continue to have devastating consequences in our communities in the years to come.
“Regardless of whether you are a student, a parent, a librarian, an author, or a community member, this is an issue that affects all of us. Access to books with LGBTQ+ representation helps LGBTQ+ people and their families feel seen, and builds empathy. Everyone deserves the right to read and to be exposed to diverse ideas and experiences.”
Mark Adler, director of the Paris-Bourbon County Public Library and last year’s winner of the Kentucky Public Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award, acknowledges that community members have the right to voice their concerns about materials in a public library but suggested it be channeled through a reconsideration request.
Each individual library has its own reconsideration process, as each community is unique in its makeup just as the local library collections are, he said. “These reconsideration requests provide an avenue for community members to file objections while also providing a structured, consistent process for libraries to follow when requests are filed. We encourage community members who have questions to bring those directly to their local libraries so we can work with the affected citizens to address their concerns.”
Shelby County’s Federspiel concurred, adding a public library should always celebrate books for all kinds of people.
In 1903, when Andrew Carnegie built the library in Shelbyville and donated $10,00 to it  “he had inscribed on the floor as you enter …  ‘A University for the People,’ showing his dedication to unite communities,” she said.
“To this day, we proudly honor these words by acquiring acquisitions that celebrate both inclusiveness and diversity of our community.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Contractor Hector Madrid Reyes was driving to Home Depot in March when he was rear-ended. As he and the other driver exchanged information, a Georgia State Patrol officer pulled up and asked for their licenses. Madrid, who arrived in the U.S. from Honduras as a teenager and was awaiting a court hearing for his asylum claim, didn’t have one.
“There’s no public transportation where we’re at, no Uber or Lyft,” said his wife, Jacqueline Maravilla, about his choice to drive. “Everything’s 45 minutes from everything. It’s a calculated risk we have to take to support our family.”

This story is part of “Trump Two: Six Months In,” a series from The Marshall Project that takes stock of the administration’s efforts to reshape immigration enforcement and criminal justice.

That risk has grown even greater for thousands of immigrant families under the Trump administration, as officials expand efforts to deport people with little or no criminal history.
The monthly number of people deported whose most serious conviction was a traffic violation — such as driving without a license — has more than tripled in the last six months, hitting almost 600 in May, according to new estimates by The Marshall Project. In total, over 1,800 people with traffic violations have been deported this year.
People with no criminal convictions at all make up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 people deported between January and May. For another 8%, the only offense on their record was illegal entry to the U.S. Only about 12% were convicted of a crime that was either violent or potentially violent. The numbers contradict officials’ continued claims that immigration enforcement is focusing on the “worst of the worst” criminal offenders.
The numbers are estimates from a Marshall Project analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, provided to the Deportation Data Project in response to a FOIA request. The group noted the dataset may be incomplete and could undercount the true numbers of deportations.
ICE officials did not respond to a request for comment.

For many facing removal, the crimes on their records are years old. So far this year more than 600 people have been deported whose most serious convictions were marijuana-related offenses, and in three out of four cases, the offense occurred at least five years ago.

“It’s not at all about convictions anymore,” said Tim Warden-Hertz, a directing attorney of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a Washington-based legal organization. “There is no discretion. It’s just trying to get as many people as they can, any way that they can.”
Historical data from the Deportation Data Project shows that previous administrations also deported people with no convictions or only minor offenses, but the numbers have increased under Trump. From President Biden’s inauguration through the end of fiscal year 2023, the last day with available data, over half of the people deported had no criminal conviction. During that period, an average of 80 people a month were deported with only traffic offenses, compared with an average of over 350 per month so far under Trump’s second term.
Some of Trump’s advisors have said publicly that the administration’s goal is for 3,000 ICE arrests each day. But in recent court filings, immigration officials have denied having a quota.

Some attorneys worry this pressure to deport more people is leading to an increase in racial profiling, and that more drivers of color are being pulled over for minor traffic violations as a way to check their legal status. Twenty states have recently passed laws that increase local police’s involvement in immigration enforcement. And a growing number of police departments are signing agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to enforce federal immigration laws during encounters like routine traffic stops.
“We hear people pulled over for minor reasons, like a broken blinker, crossing the yellow line, or the tint is too dark on windows,” said Paul R. Chavez, director of litigation and advocacy for Americans for Immigrant Justice, a Miami-based nonprofit. “People are arrested for those very minor things, brought to jail, fingerprinted, and then handed over to ICE.”
Chavez noted that many people are being charged solely with driving without a license, a crime police generally discover only after making a traffic stop. “If you’re pulled over and that’s the only accusation, in my mind that’s pretty clear evidence of racial profiling,” he said.
The number of people deported with only nonviolent offenses — like trespassing, failure to appear in court, marijuana offenses, shoplifting and traffic violations — has almost doubled since January.
After Madrid’s accident, he says he passed a breathalyzer test. But he admitted he had smoked weed the night before, 18 hours prior. The Georgia State Patrol officer arrested him on charges of driving without a license and driving under the influence.
Madrid’s only existing conviction was for driving without a license in 2019, he said. Back then, “He got arrested, I bailed him out, he had a court date, he paid the fine,” Maravilla said. “And that was the end of it.”
Things went differently this time. After Maravilla paid Madrid’s bond, ICE officers picked him up and ultimately took him to Stewart Detention Center, south of Columbus, Georgia. A judge denied his release from detention, citing the DUI charge for marijuana use the night before the accident. But the hearing in his criminal case wouldn’t happen until the following summer. Madrid had to decide between spending at least a year stuck inside a remote, overcrowded detention center — or leaving his wife and family behind.
In early July, Madrid opted to self-deport to Honduras. Maravilla, a U.S. citizen who has never been on a plane and doesn’t have a passport, is working to save enough money to visit him and bring him some of his belongings. The two were married just three weeks before his arrest.
“It’s a deep pain,” Madrid told The Marshall Project in Spanish. “I am not there with my wife, cannot see my mother and give her a hug, or help them with what I earn from my work. Listening to my wife cry on the phone has been something I do not wish for anyone.”

The stage at the north end of the Green featured a variety of live bands, DJs, and MCs that kept a small dance floor’s worth of people moving in front of them, while others lounged in lawn chairs nearby. 
The aisles among the dozens upon dozens of vendors, meanwhile, buzzed with conversation, as potential patrons checked out streetwear, African imports, beauty products, small business services, resume help, event planners, and even the chance to have an ultrasound party. 
One vendor sold posters with portraits of the businesspeople of Black Wall Street in Greenwood, in Tulsa, before it was burned to the ground in a race massacre in 1921. ​“Black Wall Street: We Did It Before, and We Can Do It Again,” his t‑shirt read.
That was the scene Saturday at an event that has become a staple of late summer in New Haven. 
The Green was a maze-like bazaar of vendors, offering everything from clothing and jewelry to mental health and legal services. Throngs of people walked the aisles, perusing what the vendors had. It was also a chance for friends to run into one another, and a chance for families to hang out on the Green, listen to live music, and get a meal from a row of food trucks that lined the curb along Temple Street. It was a celebration of Black entrepreneurship and community, and with the event seeing its biggest year yet, it showed how the two easily went hand in hand.
“Honestly, it feels amazing,” said David Burgess of The Breed, which organized the event with the city’s Economic Development Administration as a partner. Citing Breed founders Aaron Rogers and Rashad Johnson, among others, Burgess said ​“it was just a team coming together,” but ​“bringing people together like this is really a blessing.”
“The Breed has been a great partner over all four years,” said Michael Piscitelli, the city’s economic development administrator. ​“The logistics have worked really well again this year, to stage this many vendors on the Green.” He noted that Black Wall Street had under 30 vendors in its first year, about 100 in its second year, about 200 last year, and more than 200 this year. ​“People are out here spending money, enjoying the time, the music, and celebrating a really cool event here in the city.”
Burgess cited the trust The Breed has worked to build in the community as one ingredient in Black Wall Street’s growth. ​“We try to bring people together, and we try to support as many Black businesses as we can that we see in the city because there’s a need for it,” he said.
Among the vendors was painter Kayla Staples, whose business went by the name Black N Artsy. Staples got into art as a child in Stockton, Calif., ​“as a way to create, get my hands on things, then make my own little reality, and I’ve been hooked ever since,” she said. She made her way to New Haven, she said, for love (and school) by way of Texas and upstate New York. The diversity of her experiences is reflected in her art, which runs the gamut from still lifes and landscapes to more surreal and collage-like pieces.
“I really like the 3‑D side of things,” she said of a series of portraits depicting people in ski masks. Usually, she said, it’s taboo to touch art; ​“I wanted something you could literally feel,” she said, and ​“I wanted to show the unity behind the masks.” People may be very different from one another, but ​“we’re still people, whether Black, brown, a hunter, or from the street.” A portrait of a melting face, she said, is ​“an embodiment of how I was feeling at the time,” suffering a sadness. 
Staples got interested in Black Wall Street because ​“I am a Black artist, and I figured it would be the right audience for me. I get a lot of inspiration from my culture.” She motioned toward a series of portraits she did of people’s mouths, each decorated with elaborate grills. Additionally, a few friends encouraged her to try vending. She participated in her first Black Wall Street last year and it went ​“amazing,” she said. It was her first time being a vendor anywhere, ​“so I was a little nervous, but it went so well. That’s what brought me back again this year,” which was going ​“equally well.” She looks forward to keeping on developing as both an entrepreneur and an artist.
“AI can’t do this,” she said.
Nearby was a booth for Melanin Skein, where Alexa Monrose was on hand selling crocheted hats, tops, dresses, and other items. Monrose started crocheting as a hobby in 2022 as a ​“Christmas gift to myself,” she said. She bought supplies from JoAnn Fabric. She took a trip to Jamaica with her family and decided to make her own clothes for that. She started making things for other people ​“kind of randomly,” she said. This April, a cousin’s hairdresser asked her to make a piece for her daughter after striking up a conversation and seeing pictures of what she’d made. The daughter came to pick up the piece and loved it, and ​“that’s when she told me about Black Wall Street.”
She spent the summer making an array of pieces to sell, following her own tastes of leaning toward bright colors while also keeping an eye on what current fashion trends were. She figured she might have made it a business in time, but ​“Black Wall Street probably got my face out there for people to know.”
“I’m a proud, first-generation Haitian girl trying to make it,” she said. ​“I’m trying to take my crochets, my talents, into the fashion world,” and ​“I’m trying to make a deal with myself.”
As afternoon moved into evening, Black Wall Street showed no sign of slowing down. The Breed hopes to make the event even bigger next year. ​“I’m always a go bigger and better man,” Burgess said. ​“We love our city and we love the people. Keep God first and we’ll continue to keep striving and keep growing.”

Missouri lawmakers are poised to return to Jefferson City next month to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts in order to gerrymander the Kansas City-based seat of Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. They’re also considering changes to the initiative petition process to make it harder for Missourians to change the state constitution.
Both have been longtime priorities of the Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-right GOP state lawmakers whose quarrels with party leaders led to years of Missouri Senate gridlock.
Yet after years of holding outsize sway in Missouri politics, the Senate Freedom Caucus is down to only two members.
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican and former caucus chairman, quit in June following a break with the group over a $1.5 billion incentive package to finance stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals.
State Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also voted in favor of the stadium bill, soon joined him. He told The Independent last week that his differences with the caucus focused on tactics, not policy.
Right-wing ‘Freedom Caucus’ launches at Oklahoma Capitol

“I’ve got nothing but respect for my friends in the Freedom Caucus,” Hudson said.
The departures mean only two state senators from St. Charles County — Nick Schroer and Adam Schnelting — are still aligned with the Freedom Caucus.
Schroer, who took over as caucus chairman after Brattin stepped down, insists the group is “stronger than ever” despite the loss of half its Senate membership.
There are 11 members of the caucus in the House, Schroer said, and numerous candidates likely to join the group who are running in GOP primaries for open Senate seats next year. Not to mention, he said, Missouri’s secretary of state and two congressmen are Freedom Caucus alums.
“I’m not concerned whatsoever that at this moment we only have two very strong senators,” he said. “And I think those numbers are going to grow. But just like in years past, there are going to be senators who may not be wearing the Freedom Caucus insignia, but they are going to be with us on 99.9% of issues.”
But the caucus’ dwindling numbers in the Senate, where its influence was always most acutely felt, has some wondering if its days in the center of the Missouri political spotlight are drawing to a close.
It began in 2018, when a group of GOP senators formed what they called the conservative caucus.
The group’s formation set off an escalating war with Republican leadership that culminated four years later when acrimony became so bad that the Senate adjourned a day early for the first time since a fixed adjournment date was set in the state constitution in 1952.
Soon after, the conservative caucus announced it was disbanding.
A year later, six Republican senators — most of whom were part of the conservative caucus — announced the formation of the Missouri Freedom Caucus.
And the Republican civil war resumed almost immediately.
The 2023 legislative session saw Freedom Caucus members using near-daily procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate. Republican leadership responded by stripping caucus members of committee assignments and musing about their expulsion.
The 2024 session saw no improvement, resulting in fewer bills passed than any year in living memory, including the COVID-shortened session in 2020.
Throughout the turmoil, the group kept losing members.
State Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, quit in 2021, telling The Independent at the time that she grew tired of the group’s disruptive tactics. She went on to become majority leader and president pro tem of the Senate, routinely squabbling with her former caucus colleagues.
GOP state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby left the group last year, saying she could no longer in good conscience be a part of “actions behind the scenes that defame grassroots and violate the needs of my constituents.”
Tensions in the Senate cooled this year, with term limits pushing key figures on both sides of the fight out of the chamber. The detente led to a much more productive session, marked more by partisan squabbling than GOP infighting.
That changed after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into special session in June to pass incentives aimed at keeping the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas.
The Freedom Caucus vowed to oppose the funding scheme, which it decried as a “handout to billionaire sports team owners.” But Brattin and Hudson voted in support of the plan after a provision was added making changes to local property tax bills.
Both were accused of betraying the caucus’ principles, with the group’s longtime political adviser publicly calling for the Freedom Caucus to “disband and join the uniparty that runs Jefferson City.”
Brattin quit soon after, saying he opposed the stadium funding but voted in favor after the property tax provisions were added that he believed would benefit his constituents.
Hudson quit a month later.
“I agree with the caucus probably on 95% of the issues,” Hudson said, “and I intend to continue to be allies with them and work with them on issues that we agree on. There have been some times where tactically, there may have been some disagreements where I may have wanted to go a different direction.”
Schroer said the fact that the legislature is poised to debate a congressional map that seeks to eliminate the Democratic-leaning seat in Kansas City shows the Freedom Caucus is anything but dead.
“Back in 2022, the Freedom Caucus pushed for a 7-1 map and couldn’t get enough Republicans to help us,” he said. “Now we’re going to do it.”
The overarching goal, he said, is that the Freedom Caucus will pull the party to the right so the caucus will no longer need to exist at all.
“When we’ve got enough of these strong-willed conservatives that are able to stand up to the establishment and stand up to special interest groups, hopefully at that point we’ll have a majority of the majority,” he said, “ and there will be no need for the Freedom Caucus.”

U.S. Army National Guard and Navy Veteran Tripp Adams announced in late July he would be suspending his campaign in order to prioritize his mental health. On Monday, Adams offered his support to former special victims prosecutor Christina Hines. 
“I want to endorse Christina as a friend, and as the leader that Macomb and Oakland counties need,” said Tripp Adams, “As a veteran and as a small business leader, when I sat down with Christina, I felt heard and seen. Christina has the plan, the leadership, and experience as a warrior fighting for us as a prosecutor to win this race and take care of the people in our community – not just Democrats, but people from all walks of life. That’s why I’m excited to endorse her campaign today.”

Hines noted her gratitude for Adams’ endorsement, with the two becoming friends in their time on the campaign trail. 
“I have deep respect for Tripp’s service to our country, his commitment to our democracy, and his determination to fight for everyone in our community. I’m glad to have him as an advisor and friend,” Hines said. 
While Michigan’s 10th Congressional District is held by U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), James’ decision to seek the governor’s seat in 2026 has left the battleground seat open to competition. 
According to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, the seat leans Republican, however Michigan 10 has been listed as a key target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Two Republicans have stepped up to succeed James in holding the district for Republicans: Michigan Open Carry Inc. President Casey Armitage and former Macomb County Assistant Prosecutor Robert Lulgjuraj.
With Adams exiting the race, four candidates are expected to face off in the Democratic primary. Alongside Hines, former state Rep. Tim Greimel, attorney Eric Chung and U.S. Army veteran Alex Hawkins are vying for the nomination.

HOLLAND — Ottawa County residents continued to call for the closure of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell coal plant on Friday, decrying a Trump Administration order in May that prevented the facility from closing as planned earlier this year.
“The Campbell coal plant is Consumers Energy’s last coal power plant (in Michigan), and it’s one of the biggest contributors to pollution in our entire state,” said Indigo Umlor, of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, which organized the protest along with the Sierra Club and other local activist groups.
The 18-year-old Byron Center resident said the majority of county residents don’t want the plant to continue operations because it’s driving up energy bills for residents and remains a major contributor to air pollution in the area.

Campbell coal plant in Port Sheldon Township to close. [ONN photo/Dirk Wierenga]“We don’t want that by our lakes. We don’t want that by any of us,” Umlor said. “The closure of the plant was planned for years and years, and it was projected to save Michiganders $600 million by 2040, but instead, Bill Huizenga has chosen to align with MAGA politicians and align with keeping this plant open for longer. This plant is costing about $1 million per day to stay open, and in the last five weeks, has cost taxpayer dollars about $30 million.”
 How we got here

The protest, which marched from downtown Holland’s Window on the Waterfront to U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga’s Holland office, was the second protest this week over the controversial continued operation of the Campbell plant, which has become the epicenter of a legal battle between the U.S. Department of Energy and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.
On Tuesday, a group of lawmakers, health professionals and other officials held a press conference in the shadow of the Campbell plant, calling on federal officials to withdraw a May 23 federal order exercising wartime powers to force Consumers to keep the plant available for operation for 90 days.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
Consumers has said closing the plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
  The J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township, operating since 1962, was scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. Consumers Energy, however, announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for May 31, 2025. [ONN photo/Sarah Leach]On May 23, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator in coordination with Consumers to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”
The Energy Department said the emergency order is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
The order came just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down.
Wright said the move was intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives, regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.”
In June, Nessel — along with a collective group of public interest organizations, Minnesota and Illinois, Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, and the Organization of Midcontinent Independent System Operator States — challenged the DOE’s order to keep the Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township to remain open for 90 days, arguing that the move will force customers to absorb exorbitant costs.
Nessel filed a request for rehearing with the DOE, challenging what she described as an “arbitrary and illegal order seeking to stop the planned retirement of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant in West Olive, Michigan, under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
She said the order “will burden Michigan utility customers with unnecessary costs and needless additional pollution from the 60-year-old Ottawa County coal plant that was scheduled to close May 31.”
When the DOE didn’t respond to Nessel’s request within 21 days, she filed a petition for review July 24 with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, D.C., Circuit, challenging the U.S. Department of Energy’s order, claiming the “arbitrary and illegal” move forced the continued operation of the plant “under the pretense of a fabricated energy emergency.”
“This unprecedented order by the Department of Energy declares an emergency without evidence, completely ignores state and federal regulators that approved the plant’s retirement, and will potentially put enormous costs onto utility customers who receive no real benefit,” Nessel said. “I will continue to fight to protect Michigan customers from unreasonable costs imposed by the federal government.”
Last month, Nessel also filed a pleading before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in response to Consumers’ request to recover the costs from running the Campbell plant beyond its initial retirement date. That proceeding is still ongoing.
Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said Tuesday that the utility is continuing to comply with the DOE order and has requested “the timely recovery of costs associated with plant operations.”
“We expect FERC will take timely action on our request. Our FERC filing from Friday, June 6, requests approval of a mechanism to recover and allocate those costs through MISO.
 Frustration mounts with residents

“This is a clear example of how the Trump Administration doesn’t care about what the constituents want. This is why we’re out here protesting,” Umlor said. “We need to show Bill Huizenga and the rest of the MAGA party that we don’t support their actions. As a matter of fact, we support our Earth.”
Friday’s protest drew nearly 100 participants, who displayed signs with slogans like “Huizenga: Listen to the people,” “Leave coal in the ground” and “My asthma and my wallet can’t afford coal.”
Dr. Steven Ashmead, a family physician and a member of the Michigan Clinicians for Climate Action, said coal-fired plants pose serious negative health effects to residents, which is part of well-settled science.
“Public health of Michigan is more important than the political favors the Trump administration owes in coal, in the fossil fuels for over 60 years,” Ashmead said.
He said the burning of fossil fuels has caused pollution that has led to widespread health issues for many Michigan residents.
“We cannot stress that enough pollutants like carbon dioxide, particulate matter, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide and toxic metals such as arsenic, lead, mercury and radioactive radon exposure is highest to those of us living closest to the plant right now,” he said. “However, those westerly winds blow those emissions straight to Grand Rapids and beyond. The coal ash contains at least 17 toxic heavy metals, including lead, mercury, cadmium, all of which damage human health and at least six neurotoxins and five known or suspected carcinogens.”
Ruby Muehlenz, a local youth activist who grew up in Holland, said keeping the Campbell open is a short-sighted move that perpetuates bad energy policy.
“Energy bills are just too damn high, guys,” Muehlenz said. “I’m in college, I’m at an apartment, I’m paying my own bills. It’s cost us already almost $30 million … energy prices will rise across the Midwest. Young people … we’re trying to create our own future.”
 Local politics involved

In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution in a 10-1 vote urging a delay in the plant’s closure pending a second look by state regulators; however, they stopped short April 22 of approving a resolution that would have brought litigation to prevent the closure altogether.
At the time, the 10 Republicans on the board cited concerns over reports from energy watchdog agencies that warned of possible brownouts and blackouts in summer 2025 if more generating facilities were taken offline.

[ONN photo/Cathy Seaver]Board Vice Chair Josh Brugger, who voted in favor of the board’s May resolution, said earlier this week that commissioners merely intended to protect county residents from potential grid instability.
“My intention was that we were deferring to the state of Michigan’s authority and for them to weigh in and provide a second opinion on whether it should or should not be closed. Like, full stop right there,” he said Tuesday.
Board Chair John Teeples echoed his colleague’s comment.
“The resolution was to ask the [MPSC] to relook at this issue, in light of the concern that the grid was in jeopardy, at risk. That’s all it was, and that’s where it ended, even though other people wanted to go beyond that,” Teeples said Tuesday.
“Some wanted to start a lawsuit, which I thought was absolutely ridiculous and a waste of taxpayer dollars without any foresight about what it could mean,” he said. “So, all we were doing was raising the flag and that was it. That’s the extent. From my perspective, the county should go no more, no less. There’s nothing wrong with asking our elected officials or regulators to make sure you’ve got your T’s crossed, your I’s, dotted. That’s all this was, and that’s where it should stay.”
 What’s the cost?

In a June 3 statement, a Consumers spokesperson said the company is currently complying with the order.
“We are currently in compliance with the order, have arranged for new shipments of coal, some of which arrived last week, and will continuously operate the Campbell Plant,” Trisha Bloembergen, West Michigan media relations specialist, said in a June 3 email. “We are still determining the overall cost, but want to ensure those costs are shared across MISO and not all on Consumers Energy customers.”
Generating power at the Campbell plant is likely to be costly for ratepayers, experts from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis wrote June 5.
Campbell Units 1 and 2, which are 63 and 58 years old, respectively, were already increasingly uncompetitive in the MISO market, meaning it cost more to generate electricity than what it could be sold for, said energy data analysts Seth Feaster and Dennis Wamsted.
According to data filed by Consumers at FERC, the operation and maintenance costs for the two units totaled $45.80 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2023 (the most recent data available). That puts both units in the red almost all the time in MISO: S&P data shows that the monthly around-the-clock price at the Michigan hub has been above $40/MWh just twice in the past two years, and never during the summer.
“In other words, the plant would lose money on virtually every MWh generated if past prices hold this summer, costs that could add up to many more millions of dollars if the units at Campbell are run for any substantial amount of time,” Feaster and Wamsted said.
Beyond operational costs, there are fuel and staffing costs as well.
“Coal itself has gotten more expensive,” said Frank Rambo, executive director at Horizon Climate Initiative, a nonprofit organization that works to use cost-saving energy market reforms to address the causes and impacts of climate change.
“That fleet has gotten more expensive to run. It’s coal, which used to be synonymous with cheap power. It’s now among the most expensive power … and then the excess costs that are incurred because they’re running more expensive resources.
Ultimately, it will be residents who foot the bill, Rambo said.
“They run those coal plants, and then they turn around, go to their commissions and recover those excess costs from their customers,” he said.
Rambo said the price could be even higher than normal because Consumers would need to buy coal on the open market rather than enter into a new contract with a mine.
“We don’t need to sign a new long-term coal supply contract because we’re shutting the plant down,” he said. “Now they may have to buy coal on the spot market.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-17-080620-1024x688.png,,,2025-08-18 10:24:13.711171

Roger Marshall and President Donald Trump.","Christy Davis, one of three candidates seeking the Kansas Democratic Party's nomination for U.S. Senate, is eager to challenge in 2026 incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican loyal to President Donald Trump. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Democrat Christy Davis’ campaign for U.S. Senate is steeped in the politics of incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Marshall and President Donald Trump.
But the resident of Cottonwood Falls is also driven by frustration that many folks holding power in Washington, D.C., have been quick to disenfranchise Kansans with no interest in placing a Marshall sign in the yard or branding themselves by wearing a MAGA cap.
“All Kansans are served by their elected officials, or should be,” Davis said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “When you’re elected to the U.S. Senate, you’re representing everyone in the state regardless of who they voted for.”
“Kansans deserve the best representation, and we’re not getting it in Washington,” she said. “Register to vote, show up at the polls and help however you can.”


Davis said Marshall, who won a competitive race in 2020 and has committed to seek reelection in 2026, chose to be among the Senate GOP’s most partisan members rather than bring civility to the job.
“There’s not enough resources in the world … for us to be spending all of our energy fighting each other,” she said. “Kansans need to know that they’re being heard, not just the ones who are invited to private meetings.”
Davis, who hasn’t held elective office, launched one of three bids for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for Senate. In terms of the August 2026 primary, her rivals would include Michael Soetaert of Wellington and Anne Parelkar of Overland Park.

‘Fight for what’s right’
Davis grew up in Harvey County and earned degrees at Kansas State University and Wichita State University. She worked as a preservation planner for the city of Newton and was a preservation officer with the Kansas Historical Society. She moved to Chase County in 2013 to become executive director of Symphony in the Flint Hills.
“The Flint Hills is one of the most endangered landscapes on the planet and so we were really focused on conservation of that landscape,” Davis said.
From 2023 until January, she was state director of rural development for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the administration of President Joe Biden. The job was to deliver hard-to-fund projects important to communities, she said.
“During the Biden administration, we invested about $1.3 billion in projects in Kansas and worked on housing, local business, energy efficiency in agribusiness and also a lot of hospitals, clinics, child care, those sorts of projects,” she said.
Davis is married with a son. She said her grandfathers served in World War II, one as a surgeon and the other with soldiers who helped liberate concentration camps. She said their service wasn’t easy, but they did it because they “understood the importance of right and wrong, and they believed that it was an American value.”
Davis said her sister was a physician who died while advocating for the Affordable Care Act, the landmark law signed by President Barack Obama that reshaped health care in the United States.
“I tell people I’ve survived 36 hours of labor, and I’ve survived a double mastectomy, and after that, it doesn’t seem so hard to fight, to fight for what’s right,” Davis said.

‘It’s an embarrassment’
Davis ran for the U.S. House in 2020 but lost the Democratic primary. That 1st District campaign was won by U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann, a Republican who still serves a district stretching from Dodge City to Lawrence.
The last time Kansas elected a Democratic candidate to the U.S. Senate was in 1932. Both of the state’s Senate seats have been held by Republicans since 1939.
“Sometimes there are other factors at play besides who the best candidate is,” Davis said. “The key is garnering that support, raising enough money early to get, you know, on the ground and begin the hard work.”
She said one of her strengths as a candidate was that she had worked in every county in Kansas and understood issues relevant to a diverse constituency. She said Congress wasn’t fighting battles that needed to be fought for Kansans, including affordable housing and the rising cost of living.
Congress should stand up for fundamental rights, including due process, amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, Davis said.
She said she was an unwavering supporter of public education and was convinced the effort to close the U.S. Department of Education would make education a significant campaign issue in 2026. She opposed appropriation of tax dollars to private schools.
“I believe that we should be doing everything we can to shore up public education,” she said.

Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19.","In this photo illustration, Ruth Jones, Immunization Nurse, holds a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (brand name: Comirnaty) at Borinquen Health Care Center on May 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.  (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Health groups urge insurers to cover COVID-19 shots for pregnant women

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.

Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.

Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.










The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council


The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s effort to redraw California’s congressional maps is the marquee item on the state Legislature’s agenda, now that lawmakers are back today from summer recess and eyeing a frenetic schedule to decide the fate of more than 200 other bills in the next few weeks.
As CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff explains, Democratic officials released new maps on Friday that would give the party a greater chance of picking up five more seats currently held by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives during the 2026 midterm elections. The maps would also help shore up seats barely held by Democrats in five other districts.
Before the end of this week, state lawmakers plan to hold a vote that would place the new maps on the ballot in a statewide special election. If passed, California voters would then decide on Nov. 4 whether to approve or reject the maps.
Newsom’s plan — which is in direct response to Texas’ own redistricting efforts — is being slammed by Republicans as an illegal power grab by Democrats. The National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement that it was prepared to fight Newsom in court.
An estimate by Assembly Republicans calculated that the special election would cost taxpayers more than $235 million. The last special election, in which voters rejected recalling Newsom in 2021, cost about $200 million. 
The state has pledged to cover the cost for counties for this election, and some early numbers have come in: Fresno and Riverside counties, for example, estimate it would cost them up to $4 million and $16 million, respectively.

Speaking of the maps: Alexei and CalMatters’ Jeremia Kimelman built a lookup tool that enables you to check if you could be affected by the redistricting plan. Though the new maps aim to give Democrats five more seats in the House, more districts could be altered. Check it out here.

Some news affecting California’s cost of living:

Gas prices: Despite ambitions to wean the state from fossil fuels and a campaign last year cracking down on oil companies over alleged gas price gouging, Newsom and Democratic leaders now find themselves negotiating a plan with oil companies to boost in-state oil production. The move comes after two California fuel refineries said they were shutting down sooner than expected, which could lead to gas prices rising to more than $8 a gallon by the end of 2026, according to a hotly contested estimate by one professor at University of Southern California. Democratic leaders are facing increased pressure to make the state more affordable. Read more from CalMatters’ Alexei, Alejandro Lazo and Maya C. Miller.


Health insurance: If you’re one of the nearly 2 million Californians covered by health insurance through Covered California, you will see your premiums increase by an average of 10.3% next year. This is the first time the marketplace’s rate will increase by double digits since 2018. While Covered California’s director cited a number of factors, including rising health care costs, about 2% of the rate increase is due to expiring federal aid that President Donald Trump did not extend in his federal budget bill. These enhanced subsidies were used by more than 90% of Affordable Care Act enrollees nationwide, and California stands to lose about $2.1 billion because of Trump’s changes.

Colorado River water shortages

Federal officials last week said the country’s two largest reservoirs could see steep declines in water levels within the coming years — a prospect that would severely affect the water supply of seven states, including California, writes CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
The Colorado River’s Lake Mead and Lake Powell are each only 31% full, and are projected to dip to levels that would further tensions among the states in the Colorado River basin that must agree on new river management standards after 2026, when current guidelines expire. 
Based on two-year projections by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, some states could see their total annual allotment of Colorado River water cut by 5% to 18%. Because California has senior rights to the water, it has been spared from mandatory conservation.
Still, the risk of overdrafting the reservoirs underscores California’s dependency on them: The state takes the biggest share of Colorado River water, which it uses to irrigate crops in the Imperial Valley and to supply water to Southern California. 
Officials have warned that states must reach a broad agreement by Nov. 11 or risk having the federal government step in.

(Commonwealth Media Services)*This story will be updated*
The 2026 race for governor has begun in Pennsylvania.
After months of speculation, state Treasurer Stacy Garrity formally announced her candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor on Monday. 
Garrity, a combat veteran and Bradford County native, was first elected to statewide office in 2020 by defeating incumbent state Treasurer Joe Torsella by just under one point. Her victory over the Montgomery County Democrat was seen as an upset. 
She secured a second term in 2024 by defeating Democrat Erin McClelland by six points. During the campaign, she broke the record in Pennsylvania for most votes won by a candidate for statewide office. That record was previously held by Gov. Josh Shapiro’s 2022 landslide victory over GOP state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a potential challenger to Garrity for the 2026 nomination.
Garrity is the first Republican to announce her intentions for the statewide office.
Her announcement did not come as a surprise to political observers. During a conservative gathering in April, she told the Capital-Star that she was considering a run for the office. 
“I think right now…millions of Pennsylvanians feel that we’re at a crossroads in Pennsylvania and we have to decide what kind of state we’re going to be,” she said.
Just last week, she released a video sharply criticizing Shapiro and added that “help is on the way.” 
The Pennsylvania Republican Party is set to meet in September to endorse a candidate in the race. During the previous gubernatorial campaign in 2022, the party did not endorse a candidate in the crowded field, while Donald Trump delivered a last-minute endorsement to Mastriano.
Garrity and Mastriano have both been vocal supporters of President Trump.
The last time a Republican candidate won the race for governor in Pennsylvania was then-Attorney General Tom Corbett’s victory in 2010. Since then, three Democratic candidates – Tom Wolf (twice) and Shapiro – have won by nearly double digits.
Shapiro has not formally announced his bid for a second term, but is widely expected to run for re-election. He has a 61% approval rating, according to a Morning Consult poll released last month.
During an appearance in Luzerne County on Friday, Shapiro was asked about potentially facing Garrity in 2026. 
“Look, the Republicans are going to deal with their intramural fight. I’m not going to get into their parlor games,” Shapiro responded. “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to keep creating jobs here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I’m going to fund our kids’ schools. I’m going to make sure that we have more cops on the beat, and I’m going to focus on doing my job of bringing Republicans and Democrats together to get stuff done. That’s my focus. They can focus on their political games all they want.”

(Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.)President Donald Trump’s campaign to deport immigrants en masse has reached the southeast Asian community in East St. Paul and beyond.
More than 150 southeast Asians have been deported from Minnesota since May, according to MN8, a Southeast Asian political advocacy group. More are awaiting deportation at an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana.
Many of those deported were brought to the U.S. as children as their parents fled the destruction of the Vietnam War and what’s known as the Secret War in Laos. The CIA recruited Hmong people in Laos to fight against the North Vietnamese army; many of the surviving soldiers fled with their families to the U.S. after the war. 
Activists gathered at the East Side Freedom Library in St. Paul Sunday to call attention to the deportations and discuss how to respond.
“Those same children who came as refugees are being sent back to the countries their family originally fled from by the same government that was responsible for their displacement 50 years ago,” said Montha Chum, executive director of MN8.
The Trump administration has highlighted the criminal records of the southeast Asian deportees. Many of those deported had served their sentences and became productive members of society, said Mai Neng Moua, an immigration attorney and board chair of MN8.
Rep. Kaohly Vang Her, DFL-St. Paul, was three years old when her parents joined the initial wave of Hmong refugees fleeing Laos for the U.S.; her grandfather was a colonel in the Secret War. 
Her — also a candidate for mayor of St. Paul — and MN8 supported reforms to the state pardon and clemency process that were passed by the DFL-controlled Legislature in 2023. Those reforms are of particular importance to immigrants with felonies on their records, who may be subject to deportation. 
Her said after Trump was elected to a second term, she and Rep. Liz Lee, DFL-St. Paul, met with staff from the administration of Joe Biden to ask for expedited pardons — including for those who could be at risk of deportation due to prior convictions. But the administration didn’t have enough time to issue the pardons, according to Her. 
“We felt so hopeless because we knew what was going to be coming for our communities,” Her said.
MN8 is working with other organizations to gather information on deportees, connect deportees to their families and send care packages upon their arrival in their new — often unfamiliar — country, Chum said.

After years of cracking down on California’s oil industry, Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative Democrats are moving to get Kern County wells pumping again to avoid soaring gasoline prices.


The oil industry is having an I-told-you-so moment in California.
For decades, the state has raced to end its reliance on fossil fuels and prioritize clean energy. Its relationship with oil companies became particularly contentious in the past two years, as Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democratic legislators held two special sessions to crack down on alleged price gouging at the pump.
But now two of its last remaining fuel refineries are closing sooner than California expected, tossing a simmering emergency into officials’ laps. With a hotly debated forecast that $8-per-gallon gasoline might be on the horizon, there has been a remarkable shift at the state Capitol. Led by Newsom, who just last fall was lambasting oil companies for “screwing” consumers, California may soon let its black gold flow again.
“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said at a press conference last month. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”
Newsom and Democratic legislative leaders are now negotiating a plan with the industry to boost stagnating production in California’s oil-drilling hub of Kern County — and avert a nightmare scenario for a governor with national ambitions and a party that has promised to focus on affordability. Lawmakers could pass a measure before the end of their annual session in mid-September, though the details remain unsettled and environmental groups are raising alarms.
The headspinning realignment potentially heralds a new era in California’s transition to a carbon-free future, as high costs, technological impediments and flagging political will force Democrats to recalibrate their ambitious climate goals. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are also taking aim at the state’s vast powers to regulate its greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, including revoking California’s mandate to phase out gas-powered vehicles and slashing renewable energy tax credits.
“We all need to kind of evolve. Maybe that’s just the lesson on climate. There’s not really a purity test on this. It’s not like civil rights,” said state Sen. Henry Stern, a Calabasas Democrat who five years ago was publicly advocating for keeping more California oil in the ground. 
As both a staffer and a legislator, Stern worked on major laws to require buffer zones around oil wells in sensitive areas and restrict the well stimulation technique known as fracking. But he said he does not want California to see the same backlash to climate action as western Europe, where environmentally focused Green parties have recently been crushed electorally by far-right populists.
“We can perform a muscular version of climate policy that doesn’t have to be so all-or-nothing,” Stern said.
Oil industry forces Newsom’s hand
Refinery closures are accelerating the pressure in Sacramento. Two days after Newsom signed a law increasing state oversight of maintenance, Phillips 66 announced in October that it would shut its Los Angeles facility by the end of 2025 because of concerns over the sustainability of the California market. Then in April, Valero declared it would close its Benicia refinery next year, citing a challenging regulatory environment.
That would leave only six major facilities to refine crude oil into transportation fuels in a state that remains the country’s second-largest gasoline consumer after Texas, as well as a major user of jet fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A business professor at the University of Southern California projected the loss of refining capacity, which will be offset with more expensive imports of finished fuel, combined with additional state actions, could send gasoline prices spiraling past $8 per gallon by the end of 2026.
Republicans pounced on that figure to criticize Newsom for fomenting an energy crisis in California, sparking fierce pushback from the governor’s office, which has dismissed the report as an “unscientific analysis” by a professor with close ties to the oil industry. Other experts have estimated a smaller effect on prices, which currently average about $4.49 per gallon in California, according to AAA, $1.33 higher than the national average but lower than they’ve been since January. 
The Western States Petroleum Association — the powerful Sacramento-based lobby for the oil and gas industry that has donated more than $330,000 to lawmakers in the past decade — blames taxes, fees and regulations for California’s high prices. Decades of state rules, including strict emissions targets, a ban on the additive MTBE, and requirements for a special gasoline blend, traditionally make refining more expensive. Drilling in California is also in what the industry calls “terminal decline” as the Newsom administration has largely stopped issuing new permits, forcing a greater reliance on foreign countries such as Brazil, Iraq, Guyana and Ecuador with looser labor and environmental standards.
“At some point, are you going to have enough supply to meet California’s demands?” said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, CEO of the petroleum association, who evoked the fuel shortages and long lines at gas stations that followed a 1973 embargo against the United States by other oil-producing nations. “People’s lives were completely disrupted.”
Industry leaders argue pumping more crude oil in California, particularly in Kern County, could help meet demand at a lower cost. But if the state doesn’t act quickly, they warn that production could drop so low it would shut down pipelines between local oil fields and refineries, further exacerbating a crisis of California’s own creation.
“For me, I don’t care if the motivation is political or policy. I’m very happy that we’re having a conversation about something that’s really impactful to the consumers of California,” Reheis-Boyd said. 
Climate commitment meets reality
After years of making the oil industry into a political boogeyman, Newsom has become surprisingly receptive to its message.
Gone is the bombastic governor who declared to a United Nations summit in 2023 that “this climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis,” or strong-armed the Legislature that same year into adopting a law that could penalize oil companies for excessive profits.

In April, after Valero said it would close its Benicia refinery, Newsom directed Siva Gunda, vice chair of the California Energy Commission, to “redouble the state’s efforts to work closely with refiners on short- and long-term planning” and ensure a “reliable supply of transportation fuels.”
Gunda returned a series of recommendations in June that closely aligned with the industry’s wishlist, including stabilizing in-state crude production, rolling back regulations that limit imports and improving investor confidence.
While the commission is exploring delaying implementation of the profit penalty and refinery maintenance oversight laws, Newsom began circulating a draft bill that would provide blanket approval for environmental reviews of Kern County wells to sidestep litigation that has stalled drilling. That proposal is now at the center of negotiations over a legislative package that could simultaneously create new standards for restarting offshore drilling, require the industry to plug more idle wells and end the use of fracking. 
“We’re in the ‘how’ business. We move to a low-carbon, green-growth future, change the way we produce and consume energy,” Newsom said at the press conference last month. “At the same time, we have enough available fuel supplies, a stable fuel supply and address the anxieties around cost. Both and.”
Matt Rodriguez, a longtime Democratic consultant who has worked in California and on several presidential campaigns, said Newsom is caught between a commitment to climate action that is important to the left and a substantive problem that could hurt both the economy and individual voters.
“The reality is that gas prices are higher here than the rest of the nation. That’s just undeniable,” he said. “If there are storm clouds on the horizon, you can’t just sit there and ignore it.”
The larger the gap between the price at the pump in California and in other states, Rodriguez said, the greater the liability it poses in a future presidential campaign for Newsom, who will likely also face criticism for how his own policies contributed to the problem. But Rodriguez said there is a potential upside if the governor can negotiate a solution with the oil industry, allowing him to tout himself as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue.
“Any way that he can keep gas prices from ballooning, that’s his imperative,” Rodriguez said.
‘We didn’t have a champion’
Environmental groups, meanwhile, are up in arms. More than 120 signed a letter earlier this month opposing Newsom’s push, which they characterized as an industry giveaway that would “gravely harm the air we breathe and water we drink around the state, but have no impact on refinery closures or gas prices.”
Hollin Kretzmann, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, called the governor’s proposal to streamline approval of new Kern County wells a “drill, baby, drill” plan that would “eviscerate” California’s bedrock environmental review law for one of its core purposes: reining in a polluting industry.
He noted that courts already struck down earlier versions of the idea when Kern County tried it, because the environmental review was deemed insufficient. Last month, the county passed a third version of the plan, which Newsom’s bill would enshrine into state law.
“It’s a very misguided and ill-conceived proposal,” Kretzmann said.

Martha Dina Argüello, executive director of the Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, remembers attending a press conference last September, outside the Inglewood Oil Field, where Newsom signed a trio of new laws aimed at cleaning up idle wells and restricting oil and gas operations. She said she was “stunned” by the governor’s rapid reversal and warned that it would allow the oil industry to gut public health protections under the guise of affordability, passing the costs on to low-income communities near oil fields and refineries that have higher asthma and cancer risks from exposure to toxic chemicals.
“You don’t often get champions who are consistent — and it’s very sad that we didn’t have a champion that was really going to do the difficult thing and tell us the changes that we need to make to actually address climate change and air pollution,” she said. “That’s what our communities still need.”
Landing a deal will be tricky
The governor’s office is working to find an approach that can get through the Legislature in a short time frame. Lawmakers return from their summer recess on Monday for the final month of session.
That could necessitate making tradeoffs between priorities for environmentally minded lawmakers on the left, such as protecting the buffer zones around oil wells, and moderates more sympathetic to the industry’s arguments. It’s possible the proposal will be merged with a separate effort to extend California’s cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions, because oil refiners are seeking a more gradual decline in the credits that allow them to emit carbon pollution without paying.
Stern described the mood among lawmakers as “begrudgingly practical,” but also grumpy about having to take on yet another fight over oil, “so nothing feels like a win.” Given the political sensitivities, he said it was possible the Legislature would pass only the provision to boost drilling in Kern County and carry over the rest of the discussion into next year.
Nevertheless, the boundaries of the debate around domestic oil production have completely shifted in Sacramento, with affordability taking on a more prominent role.

Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, an Irvine Democrat who chairs the Assembly’s utilities and energy committee, said the Legislature could no longer afford to treat California’s energy transition like a future aspiration, as previous generations of officials have. Instead, lawmakers must be pragmatic and retain the support of everyday Californians, she said, because without their buy-in, the state will cease to be a climate leader.
“There are some advocates who continue to think that you can somehow just wave a magic wand and end oil production in California without terrible consequences,” she said. “We need California to be an inspiration, and not a cautionary tale.”
An agreement to expand drilling would be a hard-fought victory for Sen. Shannon Grove, a Bakersfield Republican who has spent the majority of her 10-year legislative career repeatedly warning that cutting oil production in California would only increase reliance on imports from countries with lower environmental and labor standards.
“Do I wish that companies and businesses would not have left my district and taken their jobs with them and created a vast unemployment rate? Do I wish that the people who lost their jobs still had their jobs? Do I wish it would have happened sooner?” Grove said. “Yes. But I’m grateful that it’s happening.”
Grove said Kern County, which also is home to some of the state’s largest solar and wind projects, has the potential to be the “energy capital of the United States.” She argues the county has done its due diligence with environmental reviews to ensure that future drilling projects are more climate conscious than importing oil from other countries. 
“If you’re going to do it, you have to do it right,” she said, “and Kern County does it right.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/070622_Oil_Field_LV_CM_006.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

California has an overwhelmingly Democratic delegation in Congress. Gov. Newsom’s plan could give his party five more seats and offset a Texas gerrymander.


The fight over redistricting is about to hit overdrive in California.
As the Legislature returns to Sacramento today for the final month of session, Democrats are racing to finish a plan that could tilt the state’s congressional map in their favor — and thrust California into another confrontation with President Donald Trump.
Republicans, who stand to lose more than half their seats in the state, decry the scheme as a self-serving power grab. But supporters, led by Gov. Gav Newsom, contend they are saving democracy by stopping Trump from rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterms.
Ultimately, California voters will likely decide in a special election this November.
Here’s what you need to know:
Wait, what is Newsom trying to do?
The governor is leading the charge for the Democratic response in a burgeoning partisan showdown that could effectively determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives before a single vote is cast next November.
This kicked off thousands of miles away from Sacramento — in Texas. Earlier this year, Trump began pressuring Republican leaders there to redraw its congressional lines to shore up the GOP’s narrow majority in the House. As his approval rating sinks, the president is worried Democrats could win back Congress in the 2026 election and disrupt the final two years of his term.
Even as dozens of Democratic members have fled the state in protest, the Texas Legislature is advancing a new map that could flip five Democratic House seats to Republican control. Other conservative states, including Ohio, Missouri, Indiana and Florida, are considering similar actions.
So, channeling the anger of Democratic voters, Newsom has launched California into a retaliatory redistricting that would offset the Texas map with five new Democratic-leaning seats.
“Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,” Newsom said during a rally last week formally kicking off the campaign. “Don’t mess with the great Golden State.”
How would it work?
It’s complicated!
Unlike Texas, where the Legislature determines congressional lines, California voters in 2010 gave that power to a bipartisan citizen commission. The commission draws a new map once each decade, after the U.S. Census, to ensure each congressional district has roughly an equal number of people. It last did so in 2021.
Newsom is proposing to temporarily override the commission and create districts more favorable to Democrats until after the 2030 Census. That requires going to the voters for their approval.
Democratic officials already drew a new map in secret, which they finally shared publicly on Friday. The Legislature, where three-quarters of members are Democrats, plans to vote before the end of this week to put that map on the ballot in a statewide special election on Nov. 4.
“Voters will see the maps and have the final say,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, said in a statement.
Why the rush?
California’s primary election is in June, so work backwards from there. The deadline for candidates to declare is in early March. Those who want to collect signatures to qualify, instead of paying a filing fee, can start in December.
That means new congressional lines need to be in place by the end of the year, so candidates actually know which voters they need to reach.

Newsom is eyeing Nov. 4 for the special election to consolidate it with municipal elections across the state that day. State law requires elections officials to mail a ballot to every voter starting 29 days before the election, and to military and overseas voters 45 days before, which means ballots must be ready by late September.
The secretary of state’s office has said the Legislature must act by Friday to leave enough time for local elections officials to meet those deadlines for a Nov. 4 election. Even then, the next month will be extremely busy for them.
How much will this cost?
The state has promised to cover the expenses counties incur running this unexpected election, which won’t be cheap. The last state special election, an unsuccessful recall of Newsom in September 2021, cost about $200 million.
Newsom has said consolidating the election with already scheduled local elections on Nov. 4 could save money. But early estimates from counties — up to $4 million in Fresno and up to $16 million in Riverside — are higher than they were for the recall.
“No price tag for democracy,” Newsom told reporters last week following the kickoff rally.
Will this plan succeed?
Democrats feel good about their chances, but it’s a heavy lift.
A Politico poll found that nearly two-thirds of California voters prefer retaining the state’s independent redistricting commission over returning authority to the Legislature to draw congressional lines.
That is not exactly what Newsom’s plan would do, however. His messaging has emphasized that the commission would only be sidelined temporarily, because of what he calls a Trump-induced political emergency. It’s reflected in the name of the measure: the Election Rigging Response Act. Internal polling shared with lawmakers put support, when framed along those lines, at 52%.
While that’s enough to win in November, it may not be enough to withstand an intense campaign this fall that is expected to draw hundreds of millions of dollars in spending. Charles Munger, Jr., the longtime Republican donor who poured more than $12 million into the campaign to pass independent redistricting, has said he will open up his wallet again to defend it.
“Citizens, not politicians or partisan party insiders, should not only hold the power at the ballot box but also the power to draw the lines,” Amy Thoma Tan, a spokesperson for Munger’s campaign committee, said in a statement.
The National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement that it was prepared to “fight Gavin Newsom’s illegal power grab in the courts and at the ballot box.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Newsom-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Take a peek inside one ideal classroom scenario,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/08/california-tk/,"This fall at least 200,000 California students are expected to enroll in transitional kindergarten, which serves as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten.","In summary
This fall at least 200,000 California students are expected to enroll in transitional kindergarten, which serves as a bridge between preschool and kindergarten.


Break out the crayons and finger paint: Every 4-year-old in California is now eligible for transitional kindergarten.
Fifteen years after a handful of school districts opened the first TK classrooms, California now has the largest — and fastest growing — early education program in the country. At least 200,000 youngsters will attend TK this fall, enjoying low teacher-student ratios, age-appropriate curriculum and plenty of music, art and circle time.
“This really is something to celebrate,” said Carolyne Crolotte, policy director for Early Edge California, an advocacy group. “Now, there’s no question about who’s eligible and who isn’t. Everyone is eligible.”
TK is meant to be a bridge between preschool and kindergarten, preparing 4-year-olds for the routine and expectations of elementary school while honing their social skills and self-confidence. In TK, children learn how to make friends, write their names and do basic math. Mostly, they’re supposed to fall in love with learning.
Holding frogs and counting marshmallows
That was the case at Silverwood Elementary in Concord last week as a dozen bright-eyed 4-year-olds hovered around their teacher, Elizabeth Swanson, as she gingerly held out a tree frog for their inspection.
Several got a chance to hold the docile, turquoise amphibian.
“What does the frog feel like? What do you wonder about the frog?” said Swanson, who was recently named Mt. Diablo Unified’s Teacher of the Year. “How does he use his hands? How do you use your hands?”
But the tree frog — one of several critters in her classroom — was not the most popular attraction that afternoon. That honor belonged to the “home living” station, a corner of the classroom dedicated to costumes, dollhouses, a mini kitchen and everything else an imaginative youngster would need to play house.

Last year, an enterprising group of students, inspired by the opening of a Dutch Bros. near the school, used the home living station to open their own coffee shop. They ordered lattes and made coffee and collected money. Swanson turned it into a math lesson by asking them to count marshmallows and decide how many should go into each cup of hot chocolate.
“One child would be the barista and one would be the customer, so they learned how to share and take turns,” Swanson said. “They were getting so much practice with social language and communication. And everything was integrated into play.”
Importance of fun
Judy Krause, executive director of early childhood programs at Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena, said that’s exactly what a TK classroom should be like. The focus should be on experimentation and hands-on activities, based on students’ interests. TK, she said, is not a version of kindergarten; 4-year-olds have unique developmental needs. The main one, she said, is having fun.
If children are enjoying themselves, they’ll learn naturally, she said. If they feel overly pressured or bored, they’ll lose interest and miss out on valuable skills they’ll need for kindergarten and beyond.
“It’s a really big deal that we have this opportunity for all 4-year-olds,” Krause said. “But we have to make sure we’re doing it right.”
15-year rollout of TK
California introduced TK in 2010, and a decade later began expanding it to all districts. This year is the culmination of that effort, with all 4-year-olds now eligible and 91% of districts offering the program. The only districts that are exempt are those that don’t receive money through the state’s funding formula because they receive more money through their local property taxes. 
Like kindergarten, TK is optional. But many districts, including Mt. Diablo Unified, have seen strong interest from families. A recent report from the Public Policy Institute of California predicted that about 70% of 4-year-olds will enroll in TK this fall, with waiting lists in some districts. Black, Latino and Native American students have been slightly underrepresented so far, although those not enrolled might be enrolled in other programs. The state doesn’t track that data.
Nearly everyone agrees TK is a good idea. Children who’ve attended TK tend to do better in reading and math, and those with disabilities can be identified early and receive services, research shows. 
TK, which is free, can be a financial boon for families. Because of California’s high cost of living, child care and preschool costs are among the highest in the country, with families paying up to $20,000 annually — more than the cost of in-state tuition at the University of California. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom has long championed TK, setting aside more than $2.7 billion in the years when the state had a budget surplus. The money is to help school districts pay teachers, keep class sizes small and provide other services to the new learners. Ongoing funds will come from the state’s Local Control Funding Formula.
“California is making a big commitment to making transitional kindergarten free and accessible to all 4-year-olds,” Newsom said in a 2023 video. “When we’re finished, California will have the largest free preschool program in the country, where every 4-year-old can start their schooling on the right track, setting them up for success further down the road.”  
Teacher shortage and other challenges
But the TK rollout has had some hiccups. The chief one is finding enough qualified teachers. Because of the small class sizes and the extra qualifications required to teach 4-year-olds, there’s a shortfall of at least 12,000 TK teachers, according to Early Edge California. Last year the state introduced a new TK-through-third-grade credential and more districts are partnering with local colleges to recruit and train future teachers, which has eased the shortage somewhat.
Another obstacle has been finding classroom space. Like kindergarten classrooms, TK classrooms must contain bathrooms, which means that districts had to find money to remodel existing classrooms, or build new ones altogether. Last year’s $10 billion school construction bond has funding available for TK projects.
TK has also had an impact on preschools. Families in California have several early education options: state-funded preschools for low-income families, federal Head Start preschool for very low-income families, and private preschools. Now that 4-year-olds have a free option, existing preschools have seen an enrollment decline that, in some cases, has led schools to raise prices or even close. A recent report from UC Berkeley showed that TK expansion has led to “pre-K deserts” in some parts of the state.

Bruce Fuller, an education professor at UC Berkeley who’s researched TK, said it’s too early to tell who’s benefitting from the program. 
“We’re seeing a shift away from preschool and toward TK, but we don’t know if TK is actually reaching new families,” Fuller said. “We might just be seeing families who would have enrolled anyway.”
Dual-language programs
A handful of districts offer dual-language TK classes, which have been popular with parents. Karina Galustians, a parent in the Tujunga neighborhood of Los Angeles, enrolled her daughter Julianna last fall in an Armenian-English TK class in Los Angeles Unified’s Pinewood Early Education Center.
Galustians’ husband speaks fluent Armenian, and the couple was eager for Julianna to be able to communicate with the extended family and learn more about the culture. 
“The more languages you know, the better off you are,” said Galustians, whose first language is Spanish. “To find a school where she can get those academic skills and practice her Armenian — me and my husband were beyond grateful. We hit the jackpot.” 
Julianna starts kindergarten this fall at another Los Angeles Unified school, where she’ll be part of the Armenian dual language program. “We feel like she’s very well prepared,” Galustians said.
‘Everyone feels included’
Meanwhile, at Silverwood Elementary in Concord, Swanson ended the day by having students put away the blocks and plastic bugs and Eric Carle books. Then she sat with them in a circle and praised each child’s efforts and told them how excited she was to see them again tomorrow.
“David, you were super responsible today,” Swanson told an awed 4-year-old as she handed him a personalized certificate. “Lindsay, you were a good friend. Zaire, you were so respectful.”
Then it was time for the children to go meet their parents, who were waiting at the side of the playground. Swanson chatted with nearly every parent, telling them how much she enjoys their children.
“I think TK should be the same as what we want for society generally,” Swanson said. “It should be a place where everyone feels included and valued. We want everyone to be curious and non-judgmental and happy to be here.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081125-TK-Class-Concord-LE-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

On August 12, 2025, just days after his 83rd birthday, Richard E. Tarrant Sr. passed away at his home in Hillsboro Beach, Florida surrounded by his family. Born in Newark, New Jersey on August 6, 1942, Rich was proud to be a first-generation Irish-American. The oldest of four boys, he graduated from St. Benedict’s Preparatory School in Newark before enrolling at New York basketball powerhouse Saint Bonaventure University in 1960.
After his freshman year at St. Bonnie’s, Rich realized he’d need a scholarship to continue his education. Disappointed to learn St. Bonnie’s would not guarantee a scholarship, he applied for a transfer to several other colleges. St. Michael’s College in Winooski, Vermont came through with a full scholarship, and the rest is basketball history. Leading St. Mike’s Purple Knights to multiple titles, “Richie the Robot” was named to the All-American Team in 1965 and drafted by the Boston Celtics as a fourth-round draft choice immediately after graduation. He played with Celtics greats Casey Jones, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, and Bill Russell. After being released at the end of pre-season, Rich went directly from the Celtics’ offices to IBM’s Boston Regional Headquarters, and although he didn’t have an appointment for an interview, the Regional Director met with him and hired him on the spot, thus setting the stage for Rich’s next chapter.
Rich excelled at selling computers in rural Vermont in the mid-1960’s – no easy feat. He was repeatedly named Salesman of the Year before leaving IBM in 1969 to start what became IDX Systems Corporation. With thousands of employees and offices worldwide, under Rich’s guidance, IDX flourished in early healthcare information technology. The company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1995, and in 2005 was acquired by GE Healthcare.
Rich then turned his attention to national healthcare. Hoping to impact the broken American healthcare system through a national pulpit, he ran unsuccessfully for Vermont’s U.S. Senate seat in 2006. Never one to let adversity get in his way, Rich went on to found Marathon Health based in Winooski, Vermont. The company’s on-site clinics for corporations and government entities proved that managing healthcare on a personal level was far more effective than the existing American healthcare bureaucracy. To encourage entrepreneurship, Rich also invested in and mentored many other fledgling companies.
Rich felt strongly that his good fortune came with responsibilities. Along with his wife Deb, he established the Richard E. and Deborah L. Tarrant Foundation in 2005. Hundreds of non-profits have received funding from the Tarrant Foundation. In addition, the Foundation made a lasting impact on Vermont’s education system through the Tarrant Institute for Innovative Education. As Rich’s brainchild, the Institute partnered with the University of Vermont to train teachers across the state using interactive technology in the classroom and allowing students to learn and excel in non-traditional ways. Through the Foundation, Rich was also the creative force behind the recently released documentary “Gone Guys”. The film highlights the disenfranchised state young men across America face due to the current social climate and the lack of clear paths to successful manhood. “Gone Guys” was received to critical acclaim, winning the award for Best Documentary Feature at the Vermont Film Festival on the very day of Rich’s passing.
Rich was a master jokester with a zest for life that was contagious. As a member of the Boca Raton Economic Roundtable (aka Scuttlebutt) since 2006, he especially relished his role as unofficial court jester while sharing insights on economic and world issues.
Although Rich was tremendously successful in business and philanthropic ventures, his family is what brought him true joy. He is survived by Deb Tarrant (nee Deborah Miles Messner), his wife and partner of 28 years, his former wife Amy Tarrant (nee Amy Fayette), and seven children – Jerry Tarrant (Lori), Rich Tarrant Jr. (Tracy), Brian Tarrant (Christina), Ellen Ludwig (Derek), Audrey Williams (Basil), Tori Messner (Natalia), and Kyle Messner (Amanda). His 12 grandchildren (with number 13 on the way) meant the world to him and gave him endless delight – Gretchen, Claudia, Anisa, Cole, Lily, Nina, Vera, Eva, London, Ariana, Jasmine, and Miles.
Rich leaves a legacy of profound impact on thousands of lives. With a ready smile and a giving heart, at 6’6” he was larger-than-life with charisma to match. He was truly a “giant among men”.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Renewable energy advocates Wednesday appealed a Montgomery County circuit judge’s ruling excluding them from consideration of customer rates set by Alabama Power.
Energy Alabama, a renewable energy organization, is seeking to join a docket to set the Energy Cost Recovery (ECR) rate, a price that Alabama Power can charge customers to offset the money they pay for fuel that the Public Service Commission allows.
“We believe decisions that affect customers should be made in the open,” said Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama. “Not in secret. Fuel costs have a major impact on monthly bills, and they are changed with virtually no transparency or public scrutiny. We are asking the Alabama Supreme Court to recognize that customers have the right to be heard when decisions about their energy costs are being made.”

The PSC adjusts the rate as often as every month to align with the price of oil, natural gas and uranium in the market. To update the rate, the PSC issues interim consent orders based on recommendations from Alabama Power but has not allowed public input on the measure since 2008 and considers the docket closed.
The ECR rate is updated on an ongoing basis depending on the market rate for the different sources of fuel. Typically, Alabama Power submits a request to allow it to charge customers a specific price for the fuel that it buys that the PSC can either approve or change.
The issue of whether the PSC allows for the rate adjustments amounts to a proceeding is a critical issue because the regulations allow other parties to intervene and be part of the docket if there is a proceeding.
Energy Alabama’s position is that the updates are, in fact, proceedings, and that the public has a right to be part of the docket and weigh in on the appropriate rate ECR that Alabama Power should charge.
Montgomery Circuit Court Judge Brooke Reid ruled in July that the PSC could prevent Energy Alabama from intervening in the docket because the case does not involve fraud or reach a decision in which the evidence did not align with the decision, the only two instances that Alabama law allows the court to intervene.
Energy Alabama now wants the Alabama Supreme Court to decide whether updates to the rate ECR amount to a “proceeding” that would allow Energy Alabama to be part of the docket and weigh in on the decision.
A message was sent to Alabama Power and the Public Service Commission on Thursday seeking comment.
Energy Alabama filed a petition in May 2024 requesting to be part of the docket for deciding the fuel cost. In response, Alabama Power said in filing to the PSC that the rate adjustments are not proceedings that allow Energy Alabama to intervene and be party to the docket.
In the end, the PSC sided with Alabama Power and ruled in August 2024 that Energy Alabama could not intervene and be part of the docket. Energy Alabama requested the PSC reconsider its decision, but the PSC affirmed its decision in September that same year.

The Trump administration in July announced changes to long-standing federal guidelines that allowed social safety net programs including community health centers, homeless shelters, and child care programs to offer services without verifying immigration status. 
“Currently, no individual is being denied services at the Health District or Southern Nevada Community Health Center under this reinterpretation,” Jennifer Sizemore, a spokeswoman with the Southern Nevada Health District, said in an email. “We are closely monitoring developments, providing input, and preparing for potential operational changes should the policy take effect. Our priority remains protecting the health of all residents and maintaining access to essential public health services.”
SNHD couldn’t answer additional questions about the potential impact of the federal policies changes on undocumented people accessing health services, since the issue is being litigated. 
Days after the Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia, have signed onto a lawsuit challenging the rule, arguing it’s already sowing chaos in communities.
Dr. Cassius Lockett, the District Health Officer for the Southern Nevada Health District, told district board of health members at a July 24 meeting that “a little over 50% of our clients in the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are undocumented” and could lose access to primary care services, behavioral health services and family planning under the rule change as written. 
Lockett didn’t specify an exact figure of the number of undocumented patients who could lose access to health services at the district. 
The district is conducting an analysis to understand the fiscal impact from the federal changes, he said. 
The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 had a long-standing practice of allowing various community based programs that rely on federal funds to serve people regardless of immigration status.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced July 10 it would reverse that policy and require agencies to check immigration status. 
“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” said Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr in a statement.
In their suit challenging the policy reversal, attorneys general argued multiple programs “cannot realistically conduct verification at the door, such as 24/7 crisis hotlines, emergency services for individuals suffering an overdose, and homeless shelters.” 
“Even if some programs could implement such verification with time and resources, vulnerable people lack government identification when accessing these services for myriad reasons—some may be undocumented immigrants, but many others are U.S. Citizens or permanent residents,” the suit contends. “For the first time, millions of people are facing a new demand before they can access the Nation’s most essential programs: ‘show me your papers.’
Dr. Frank Nemec, the vice chair for the health board, said during the board’s July 24 meeting that the decision wasn’t just cruel but could have a “devastating economic impact on an already fragile medical infrastructure” in Nevada. 
Another “unintended consequence” could mean emergency rooms and trauma systems seeing an uptick in people who normally seek health services through community clinics, Lockett said.  
Federally Qualified Health Centers, which receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations, are still unclear on the full impact of the rule change, said Randy Smith, the CEO of Southern Nevada Community Health Center.
“The individuals that we’re talking about are some of the most vulnerable members of our community,” he said. “There’s also a public health implication. They may have communicable diseases that are going to go untreated. Certainly on the individual level, it’s about quality of life … It’s a whole system of care really impacted in a very significant way in terms of access to care and the costs associated with that care.”
While roughly half of the patients coming into the Southern Nevada Community Health Center are uninsured, Smith said he wasn’t sure how many lacked health insurance because they didn’t have legal status. 
“The health center program has never had a requirement to collect eligibility documentation,” he said. “What I do know is a significant portion of them are and that’s because we’ve made efforts to help folks get on insurance and they’ve been unable to do so.”
There are also public health implications around the spread of communicable diseases.
The guidelines, if fully implemented, would mean immunizations, communicable disease testing and screening could be carried out without checking immigration status, Lockett said. 
Some in the board worried that many people, even those who are legal permanent residents or have Green Cards, aren’t seeking care, including vaccinations. 
Lockett said the district is working on doing more outreach to “make it clear they still have access to immunization services at the health district and they still have access to communicable disease services.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-15-25-at-12.01 PM-1024x572.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

	Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.



When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.



There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Laura Chramer for Alabama Reflector)What on Earth is the University of Alabama doing?
To be more precise: Why is university leadership letting federal and state officials shove Black and LGBTQ+ students out of public life? With no objection?
The UA system, as you might know, is fighting professors and students suing to overturn SB 129, Alabama’s anti-minority law — I’m sorry, “anti-DEI” law. The plaintiffs allege the statute intimidates instructors and prevents students from marginalized groups from organizing as they have a right to do.

Exhibit A: UA last year closed down a dedicated space for the Black Student Union and and another for LGBTQ+ students, known as the Safe Zone. Now UA’s attorneys say that the university can’t reopen them because of guidance the Trump administration.
“The guidance states that it would be an unlawful practice for ‘[a] university’s DEI initiative [to designate] a ‘safe space’ or lounge exclusively for students of a specific racial or ethnic group,” attorneys for the UA system wrote in a filing earlier this month.  “[E]ven if access is technically open to all, the identity-based focus creates a perception of segregation and may foster a hostile environment’ in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.”
This is ludicrous, as attorneys for the professors and students suing UA pointed out last week. The Trump administration guidance is not binding on the school. And access to the groups was not “technically” open to all; it was open to all.
“There is not a shred of evidence in the record that either the BSU space or the Safe Zone created a perception of segregation or fostered a hostile environment,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote.
I’d add that it’s a lot easier to join the Black Student Union than any of the UA Greek chapters HBO keeps shoving in our faces. The BSU doesn’t charge up to $5,532 for membership.
Ah, but following the argument of UA’s attorneys to its logical conclusion, if the most brittle white heterosexual at UA thinks the existence of Black and LGBTQ groups means segregation, segregation exists. And taking 40 seconds to explain basic concepts of association to Mr. Comeapart is too much work. Better to tell Black and LGBTQ+ students to hide themselves.
If this sounds like discrimination to you, it does to me, too.
The attorneys’ argument also will repeat UA’s shameful history. The school was built by enslaved people, some of whom were rented out by faculty members who pocketed the earnings of those who did the work.
Like every other public school in the state, UA excluded Black students through the early 1960s. When Autherine Lucy, a Black student, enrolled in a graduate library science course in 1956, a white mob stoned her car and tried to kill her. The university suspended and later expelled Lucy. When Vivian Malone and James Hood enrolled at the school in 1963, UA students made their lives hell. Hood transferred out.
One would hope this history would inspire UA’s leaders to break from it and make a campus that reflects its state and country. And by some measures, it has. There were nearly 5,000 Black students enrolled at the school in the fall of 2024, about 12% of the student body. That’s not 27%, like the Black population of the state, but a far better percentage than Auburn University (under 5%). (Schools do not track the number of students identifying as LGBTQ+.)
Yet UA leaders now seem to view that progress as a liability.
It’s hard to understand their choices over the last year if they didn’t. UA could have used its unique constitutional status to fight SB 129. It could have formed an alliance of schools to defend the mission of higher education in our state. Instead, it knuckled under and punished Black and LGBTQ+ students.
Administrators could have said something — anything — about Alireza Doroudi, a graduate student from Iran kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this year. Not only did they stay silent about Doroudi’s plight, UA leaders welcomed President Donald Trump to campus as Doroudi’s vision, hearing and mental health deteriorated in a Louisiana prison. All thanks to Trump’s actions.
Now UA’s leaders hide behind the White House to justify their craven behavior.
The school faces a choice. UA is a vital institution of research and education in our state, one that’s still relatively affordable and open to all Alabamians. UA can continue down that path, serving as engine of personal growth, social mobility and economic development.
Or it can become what the Trump administration and the Alabama Legislature want it to be: A finishing school for white Mountain Brook teenagers, subsidized by tuition payments from Dix Hills, New York and Winnetka, Illinois. A playground for rich young Alabamians, protecting them from new ideas and reinforcing their sense of privilege.
In short, it would be the old University of Alabama. A school whose mission is not educating the young, but doing what the powerful tell them.
And UA administrators keep showing their preference for the latter.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-UA-commencement-May-1-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Currently, a child nutrition program director must have a bachelor’s degree in food and nutrition, food service management, or home economics; a minimum of 1,400 hours in compensated food management or an approved alternative and 15 hours of professional development.
The proposed changes would only require candidates to have a high school diploma, three years of food service management experience, state approved training and a level four certificate from the School Nutrition Association. The aim, said State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey on Thursday, is to make it easier for school districts with less than 2,500 students to hire directors.

“One of the big issues is, especially in small school districts, they may have somebody who’s really good, who has been the high school cafeteria manager for forever, but she doesn’t have a college degree and therefore doesn’t qualify for a promotion,” Mackey said.
Under the proposed changes, Child Nutrition Program directors in school districts with 2,500 students or more will still be required to have a valid Alabama Professional Child Nutrition Program Director Certificate issued by the state department and a bachelor’s degree.
The Child Nutrition Program isn’t limited to serving meals during the academic year. In addition to providing breakfast and lunch, ALSDE also oversees weekend, nighttime and summer feeding programs.
“It’s not just school lunch. School lunch is a big piece of it, but it’s a huge operation that provides for many families whose children are getting most of their meals through our department,” Mackey said.

Wes Moore says he didn't inherit a $5 billion budget surplus in 2022, but a structural deficit propped up with COVID money. But longtime GOP adviser Jim Burton says there's still no getting around the bottom-line numbers.","Gov. Wes Moore hands a pen used to sign the state's $67 billion fiscal 2026 budget to House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes in May. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Recently, Gov. Wes Moore appeared on Special Report with Bret Baier on Fox News. When questioned about Maryland’s growing budget deficit, Moore dismissed the premise outright, stating, “That’s been debunked over and over.”
But has it really?
In January 2023, just days into his administration, Moore himself said, “We anticipate ending the current fiscal year 2023 with more than a $2 billion General Fund balance and an additional $2.9 billion in the Rainy Day Fund — $5 billion in combined General Fund cash reserves.”
It’s on tape. So, what’s been “debunked”?
Here’s the math every Marylander understands: Moore inherited a $5 billion surplus from Gov. Larry Hogan. Now, just two and a half years later, the state is staring down a projected $3 billion deficit by fiscal year 2027. That’s an $8 billion fiscal swing in the wrong direction — an alarming number, especially for working families trying to stretch every dollar in the face of rising costs and tax hikes.
Ironically, the news of Maryland’s looming deficit in 2023 broke around the same time Moore held a high-profile ceremony to unveil the official portraits of former Gov. Martin O’Malley and first lady Catherine O’Malley. Former Gov. Parris Glendening even attended. The moment was steeped in symbolism. These three governors — Glendening, O’Malley and now Moore — share more than just Democratic politics. They share a pattern of running up budget deficits and resorting to tax hikes.
As Yogi Berra once said: “It’s déjà vu all over again.”

O’Malley famously raised taxes or fees over 40 times, totaling $9.5 billion in new revenue. That record helped pave the way for Larry Hogan’s election in 2014.
Moore now seems to be following a familiar playbook.
The FY 2026 budget introduces $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees, including:

A new tech tax
Increased car registration and tire fees
Higher fishing license costs
A new capital gains surcharge

It’s no wonder Moore wants to distance himself from his once-celebrated surplus. Acknowledging it would expose just how far off track his fiscal management has taken the state.
Maryland voters have seen this movie before. In 1994 (almost), 2002, and 2014, Democratic governors overreached, and voters responded by giving Republicans their shot at leadership.
Even Moore’s own approval numbers — while not disastrous — are softening. The most recent UMBC poll showed 55% approval, 36% disapproval. That’s good, not great, especially considering the media praise and national attention he’s receiving.
After the GOP’s disheartening showing in 2022, the current fiscal crisis offers a path forward. But success isn’t automatic — Republicans must do the hard work:

Stay disciplined on message
Organize locally and statewide
Recruit strong candidates
Expand voter registration
Knock on doors and engage voters directly

Republicans need to make it clear: Moore and Democratic leaders are spending tax dollars without proper accountability or program effectiveness. Instead of making tough choices or cutting failing initiatives, their default solution is to raise taxes on hardworking Marylanders.
The gas tax is up. Fees are up. Inflation is real. And the state budget is headed into the red.
Moore can try to rewrite the history of the $5 billion surplus. But voters remember. And come 2026, they may once again decide it’s time to change the script in Annapolis.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0169-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

A chlorine gas leak had erupted from the park’s water treatment facility as the building burned, forcing firefighters to pull back. The water treatment facility is part of a system that draws water from a fragile spring. It’s the only water source and system for the park facilities on both rims, including visitor lodging and park service housing.
The fire also damaged some of the area’s water pipes and equipment, leaving fire crews to rely on a fleet of large water trucks to haul in water and raising concerns about contamination risks to the water system itself.
By mid-August, Dragon Bravo was a “megafire,” having burned over 140,000 acres, and was one of the largest fires in Arizona history. It had destroyed more than 70 structures, including the iconic Grand Canyon Lodge, and sent smoke across the region.
Wildfires like this are increasingly affecting water supplies across the U.S. and creating a compounding crisis that experts in water, utilities and emergency management are only beginning to wrestle with.
 A pattern across the West

Before 2017, when the Tubbs Fire burned through neighborhoods on the edge of Santa Rosa, California, most research on the nexus of wildfire and water had focused on issues such as drought and how climate change effects ecosystems.
The Tubbs Fire destroyed thousands of buildings and also melted plastic water pipes. After the fire, a resident’s complaint about the taste and odor of tap water led to the discovery that the fire’s damage had introduced contaminants including benzene, a carcinogen, into parts of the public water system.
It quickly became obvious that the damage discovered at the Tubbs Fire was not unique.
Similar damage and pollutants were discovered in another California water system after the 2018 Camp Fire destroyed much of Paradise, a town of over 25,000 people.
Nevada wildfires will result in more water quality challenges, study shows

The list of incidents goes on.
In southern Oregon, the 2020 Almeda Fire damaged water pipes in buildings, leaving water to flow freely. That contributed to low system pressure just when people fighting the fire needed the water.
In Colorado, the 2021 Marshall Fire burned through urban water lines, damaging six public drinking-water systems along with more than 1,000 structures in the Boulder suburbs. All six systems lost power, which in some cases led to a loss of water pressure, hampering firefighting.
As firefighters worked on the Marshall Fire, water system operators raced to keep water flowing and contaminants from being transported into the water systems. But tests still detected chemical contamination, including benzene, in parts of the systems a few weeks later.
Then, in January 2025, the Los Angeles fires supercharged concerns about water and wildfire. As firefighters raced to put out multiple fires, hydrants ran dry in some parts of the region, while others at higher elevations depressurized. Ultimately, over 16,000 structures were damaged, leading to insured losses estimated to be as high as US$45 billion.
Water infrastructure is not merely collateral damage during wildfires – it is now a central concern.
It also raises the question: What can residents, first responders and decision-makers reasonably expect from water systems that weren’t designed with today’s disasters in mind?
 Addressing the growing fire and water challenge

While no two water systems or fires are the same, nearly every water system component, ranging from storage tanks to pipelines to treatment plants, is susceptible to damage.
The Grand Canyon’s Roaring Springs system exemplifies the complexity and fragility of older systems. It supplies water to both rims of the park through a decades-old network of gravity-fed pipes and tunnels and includes the water treatment facility where firefighters were forced to retreat because of the chlorine leak.
Many water systems have vulnerable points within or near flammable wildlands, such as exposed pump houses that are crucial for pulling water from lower elevations to where it is needed.
In addition, hazardous materials such as chlorine or ammonia may be stored on-site and require special considerations in high fire risk areas. Staff capacity is often limited; some small utilities depend on a single operator, and budgets may be too constrained to modernize aging infrastructure or implement fire mitigation measures.
As climate change intensifies wildfire seasons, these vulnerabilities can become disaster risks that require making water infrastructure a more integral part of fighting and preparing for wildfires.
 Ways to help everyone prepare

As a researcher with Arizona State University’s Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory, I have been working with colleagues and fire and water systems experts on strategies to help communities and fire and water managers prepare.
Here are a few important lessons:

Prioritizing fire-resistant construction, better shielding of chemicals and, in some cases, decentralizing water systems can help protect critical facilities, particularly in high-risk zones. Having backup power supplies, mobile treatment systems and alternate water sources are essential to provide more security in the face of a wildfire.
Emergency command protocols and interagency coordination are most effective when they include water utilities as essential partners in all phases of emergency response, from planning to response to recovery. Fire crews and water operators can also benefit from joint training in emergency response, especially when system failure could hinder firefighting itself.
Longer term, protecting upstream watersheds from severe fire by thinning forests and using controlled burns, along with erosion control measures, can help maintain water quality and reduce water pollution in the aftermath of fires.
Smaller and more isolated systems, particularly in tribal or low-income communities, often need assistance to plan or implement new measures. These systems may require technical assistance, and regional support hubs could support communities with additional resources, including personnel and equipment, so they can respond quickly when crises strike.

 Looking ahead

The Dragon Bravo Fire isn’t just a wildfire story, it’s also a water story, and it signals a larger, emerging challenge across the West. As fire seasons expand in size and complexity, the overlap between fire and water will only grow.
The Grand Canyon fire offers a stark illustration of how wildfire can escalate into a multifaceted infrastructure crisis: Fire can damage water infrastructure, which in turn limits firefighting capabilities and stresses water supplies.
The question is not whether this will happen again. It’s how prepared communities will be when it does.

“This memorial will honor those affected and will stand as a lasting tribute to the loss and resilience of the Spartan community,” the agenda materials said.
Even as the university navigates financial “uncertainty” and a 9% budget reduction announced by MSU President Kevin Guskiewicz  in June of this year, plans for a memorial on campus have been under discussion since fall 2023, prompted by the Spartan community’s demand for a space to commemorate the tragedy.
The total construction costs are estimated at $3.2 million with $300,000 provided by the Spartan Strong Fund and the remainder from capital reserves. Additionally, according to the agenda materials, the maintenance of the memorial will require an annual cost of $22,500 for the upkeep of the fountain and surrounding landscape, which is described as the “highest level of service.”

In an email statement to the Advance, a MSU spokesperson, Mark Bullion, said “the memorial will be funded by $300,000 set aside from the Spartan Strong Fund, and the rest will come from the university’s capital reserves, not general fund dollars.”
The memorial’s approval followed MSU’s decision earlier this month to pause its plan to lay off psychiatric providers and transition those services to MSU Health Care as part of previously announced university-wide budget reductions.
Following the announcement of the proposed changes, an unsigned online petition circulated, calling for the reinstatement of Dr. Swapna Hingwe, the first woman of color to lead the university’s counseling and psychiatric services.
While the petition, with approximately 1,500 signatures, applauded the decision to suspend the dismissal and other changes, it also expressed apprehension about future actions. 
“We remain concerned about the damage already done and the lack of transparency surrounding the future leadership and direction of Mental Health and Trauma Support Services,” the petition stated.

Seeking to delve into healing and memory, the approved project, named the “Permanent February 13th Memorial,” as stated in the agenda documents, was designed by artists Carlos Portillo and Jessica Guinto, who described it months ago as a “communal space that fosters healing, honors, and respects the process of grieving and remembrance.” 
Bullion also highlighted the importance of the memorial for the MSU community in offering a place for reflection, healing and remembrance. “A space where our community can honor the lives lost and those who were injured and affected,” he said.
The memorial will be located between the Student Services and Natural Sciences buildings on the east side of campus. It will replace an existing fountain in the former horticulture garden, and benches and seasonal plants will be added, as illustrated in the project models.
About 5,000 people participated in the process to choose the design for the future memorial, highlighted MSU Vice Provost for University Arts and Collections, Judith Stoddart, who congratulated the community for their support and involvement. 
“From the earliest stages of this project, including input from those most directly impacted, through the final design selection, the MSU and surrounding communities played a vital role in shaping the memorial,” Stoddart said.
Guskiewicz emphasized the impact on the Spartan community of the violence experienced on the cold night of the shooting.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-18 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about the CT Alert emergency notification system,Janhavi Munde,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/ct-alert-emergency-notification-system/,"CT Alert allows towns to reach residents who have signed up with information related to evacuations, safety measures or general alerts.","In a recent interview with MSNBC focused on the state’s preparation for hurricane season, Gov. Ned Lamont referenced the deadly flooding that took place in Naugatuck Valley last August. He said Connecticut is preparing for severe weather and public safety emergencies by taking a number of steps, like setting aside money in case of major storm damage.
“I just don’t know if I can count on FEMA right now,” Lamont said, referring to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is one of the federal agencies President Donald J. Trump has been working to dismantle. 
He also urged residents to sign up for the state’s “early warning system.”
In Connecticut, several emergency notification systems operate under state and regional authorities to notify residents with important information in times of public safety and health emergencies. One relatively modern statewide system is CT Alert.
Powered by software company Everbridge, CT Alert allows participating towns’ 911 call centers to reach residents who have signed up with information related to evacuations, safety measures or general alerts via cellphone, email or text message.
In times of critical emergencies, the system, operated by the state Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection, or DESSP, may try multiple methods to reach a resident if it requests but does not receive confirmation that the person got the notification.
How many people does CT Alert reach?
Less than 10% of CT residents have signed up for CT Alert, but Connecticut’s DESSP has over 4.8 million statewide contacts in the system, which allows it to amplify reach should an emergency demand it.
In an average year, anywhere between 3,000 to 5,000 individuals sign up to be alerted through the system.  This year to date, approximately 9,000 people have signed up.
Each alert is customizable, where 911 dispatchers can choose how localized the notification is and how many people to reach.
Last year, CT Alert was used 97 times. This year, it has been used 25 times. The system sees signup spikes after events like floods, fires, and other emergencies.
How do I sign up? 
Residents can sign up on CT Alert’s website by providing their name, email address, phone number and work or home address. Residents and businesses that have listed telephone numbers are already registered for the system.
Although the system is available to all towns, its usage depends on your given town or region’s 911 centers. Some towns might use more enhanced or specific notification systems, like Reverse 911.
When a town chooses to use CT Alert it means its emergency dispatch center will utilize the system to send out emergency alerts to residents. However, a registered individual will still get statewide and regional CT alerts even if their town does not actively use the system.
Although DESPP has access to Whitepages data for landlines numbers and purchased cellphone data through Everbridge, signing up to be alerted is the most effective way to be updated by the system, officials said.
Registered data can be disclosed to third parties for the purpose of emergency notification, or as required by the law, according to CT Alert’s FAQ page.  
How is CT Alert different from other emergency notification systems? 
The driving idea behind CT Alert was to warn residents preemptively before danger is imminent. Some statewide notifications are sent out to warn of incoming, and not always expected, danger.
Reverse 911 is another commonly used emergency notification system in Connecticut, which allows local authorities to reach specific neighborhoods, zones or towns by contacting registered landlines and cellphones for localized threats.
Nationwide notification systems, tailored regionally by local law enforcement, like FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert & Warning System or AMBER alerts notify the broader public about more specific emergencies, like only natural disasters or only missing children, respectively, often using broadcasting on radio and TV in addition to cellphones.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/49805592_1315199508620985_7928512067957424128_n.jpg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

Through providing youth with evidence-based, relationship-centered mentoring programs we can help youth feel like they matter and instill a sense of belonging. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Jen Colman: Mentors help Vermont youth feel like they matter.","This commentary is by Jen Colman, of Burlington. She is a mental health provider for children and adolescents, and collaborates with youth-based organizations and schools to provide direct mental health services. Colman is also the executive director of Green Mountain Mobile Therapy, a nonprofit organization that provides accessible mental health and social emotional resources for children and adolescents.


As a mental health professional who works with Vermont’s youth, I see how our students are struggling everyday. 
Nationally, young people have reported a dramatic increase in conflict and divisiveness in our communities. A constant barrage of media, combined with social disconnectedness, creates a systemic feeling of hopelessness. 
Earlier this year, Vermont This Week on Vermont Public hosted a panel discussion on the state of youth mental health in Vermont. The conversation focused on the Vermont Department of Health’s 2023 Youth Behavior Risk Survey, released in November 2024, and the results showed that Vermont youth’s mental health is still in crisis with little improvement since the Covid-19 pandemic. 
One of the questions asked in the panel was “What do kids need?” and the collective response was that kids need to be believed and listened to. They need to feel like they belong and that they matter. It’s time for Vermont to get creative in how we approach our youth mental health crisis. 
Through providing youth with evidence-based, relationship-centered mentoring programs, we can help youth feel like they matter and instill a sense of belonging. 
Mentoring programs play a crucial role in supporting youth mental health by providing individualized, one-on-one attention and fostering meaningful relationships between youth and trusted adults. In Vermont, 96% of mentees in mentoring programs funded by the nonprofit organization MENTOR Vermont reported that their mentor made them feel like they matter, and 92% said having a mentor made a positive difference in their lives. 
MENTOR Vermont leads, expands and strengthens the mentoring movement, building capacity to make high-quality relationships accessible to all young people, so every young person in Vermont has the supportive relationships they need to grow and thrive.
Mentors offer emotional support, guidance and encouragement, which are particularly beneficial for youth struggling with mental health issues. They help young people engage in their schoolwork, think critically about their future and navigate personal challenges. This support is essential in preventing risky behaviors among young people. 
Moreover, mentoring meets youth where they live, learn, work and play, providing them with a consistent person outside of their family that they can turn to for support. 
Despite this data, 1 in 3 youth will grow up without a mentor and without the support of a trusted adult. According to the National Mentoring Partnership, young people who have mentors are more likely to improve in areas such as emotional regulation, social skills and overall life satisfaction. A study by the Journal of Primary Prevention found that mentoring can lower the likelihood of depressive symptoms and suicide attempts by providing emotional support, positive role models and a sense of belonging. 
Overall, mentoring programs are a proven tool in promoting mental well-being and ensuring that young people have the supportive relationships they need to thrive. 
Although the Vermont youth mental health crisis may seem overwhelming, it can be addressed by being proactive and putting in place proven early intervention programs such as mentoring. 
Thanks to the work of MENTOR Vermont, such programs already exist in many communities throughout the state, but they need sustainable investment to adequately meet the needs of youth across Vermont. This investment will ensure that every child who needs a mentor has access to one, and the path toward stabilizing and moving out of this crisis will become clear.

(Getty Images)Students identified with Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD are a rapidly growing exceptionality category of students who display a very individualized and complex set of needs. Many families choose to supplement the educational services offered by their school with private ABA therapy. 
Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is a commonly used technique for autism symptoms. When implemented with fidelity per research based best practices in combination with a school experience, ABA therapy can be a powerful tool for early intervention to support students navigating ASD. 
In 2024, the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General released a blistering report of Indiana’s growing ABA clinic landscape. The report tells a cautionary tale of a field with no billing caps, no quality control, no oversight, no parent voice, and audacious fiscal improprieties. According to the report, Indiana made at least $56 million in improper fee-for-service Medicaid payments for ABA therapies from 2017-2020. 
The report cited Indiana’s ABA clinics ballooning their Medicaid billing from $14.4 million to $101.8 million in just three years, the second highest in the country. The report documented examples such as an individual student receiving more than $677,000 in individual services in a three year period. Another example documented an individual student receiving more than $28,000 in services per month over multiple years. All while not preforming background checks on service providers or showing any impact on student growth. 
Autism spectrum disorder as a disability category has experienced an unprecedented level of advocacy, funding, research, and attention in the mainstream over the last 20 years. Indiana’s own Rep. Dan Burton made advocating and funding autism his own personal issue. While in office, he funneled millions to our state to better understand ASD and serve this population. As a grandfather of a child with autism, he fought tirelessly for the right of families to have high quality support.
Indiana panel to consider ABA therapy cost controls

Based on his efforts, our state has an unusually high level of expertise in this area including the Autism Center at Riley Children’s Hospital and the Indiana Institute on Disability and Community at Indiana University. Given our state’s history with ASD funding and expertise, the 2024 report is all more concerning. We are a state that should have known better than to allow this to happen to our families. 
There are multiple layers of special education accountability that schools must navigate to serve students with ASD, including the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Indiana’s Article 7. Currently, stand-alone ABA clinics do not have to adhere to any of the laws put in place to protect students with disabilities within educational settings. 
Schools are held accountable by the individual families via federally required annual meetings, where a child’s individualized education plan and progress toward annual goals are documented and discussed. They are held accountable for the academic progress of students with exceptionalities in their publicly accessible state reporting and accountability processes via the Indiana Department of Education, which includes reporting the academic achievement data of students identified as having exceptionalities. Charter schools have an additional layer of accountability as part of their authorizing processes to ensure services are provided, students are growing, and the law is being met. 
Private schools across the state offer special education support to their families in a way that matches their mission and traditions. Additionally, alternative schools, disability focused schools, recovery high schools, and adult high schools are all held accountable for the services they provide to students with exceptionalities.
Hoosier families that have children with exceptionalities deserve high quality and trustworthy options for their children. Hoosier taxpayers deserve for their tax dollars to help as many people as possible via the Medicaid system. Unfortunately, in Indiana we have not implemented an accountability process for ABA clinics, leaving the door open for predatory practices. While Medicaid, private insurances, and schools all have strict regulations and accountability processes in place to ensure quality; ABA clinics were allowed to operate with none. 
During his first few weeks in office, Gov. Braun released his executive order on ABA Therapies. His orders were clear, ABA clinics using Medicaid as a bottomless ATM must stop. The ABA Therapy commission was established to tackle this issue. 
The big question now is whether the commission will start protecting Hoosier families by holding ABA clinics just as accountable to policies and regulations as every other organization serving students with ASD.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota State University is working to get back about $66 million in federal funding it lost when the Trump administration canceled a grant program it said was a “climate slush fund.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded South Dakota’s largest university $86 million in 2023 to research the impact of bison and cattle ranchers’ land management practices on soil health, and to open markets for farmers and ranchers using those practices. It was the largest research grant in South Dakota higher education history.
The grant came from the Partners for Climate-Smart Commodities program. Since 2022 during the Biden administration, the USDA had awarded 141 projects across the country a total of $3 billion. In April, the Trump administration terminated the grants and renamed the program Advancing Markets for Producers, saying “select projects may continue if it is demonstrated that a significant amount of the federal funds awarded will go to farmers.”


Federal Fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Brooke Rollins, head of the USDA, said at the time that the Biden-era version of the program “was largely built to advance the green new scam,” a reference to policies undertaken by Biden to address climate change.
SDSU had already spent about $20 million when the climate-smart grants were terminated. The university lost an additional $1.4 million in other grant funding from the program. Two other South Dakota institutions also lost grant funding: the University of South Dakota lost $223,892, and South Dakota Mines lost $1.3 million.
The new program requires at least 65% of funding to go toward producer incentives, instead of 35% under the earlier version of the program. Kristi Cammack, assistant dean for SDSU agriculture West River operations, said the university renamed the project from “The Grass is Greener on the Other Side: Developing Climate-Smart Beef and Bison Commodities” to “Producers first: incentivizing land management and advancing markets for US beef and bison operations,” and shifted some funding originally intended for research toward producer incentives.
“We learned quite a bit over the two years we’ve been working on this, so we’ve been able to make educated shifts from research to producers while still being able to answer research questions,” Cammack said.
SDSU resubmitted its research proposal at the end of June with the hopes of regaining the award by the end of the summer.
“Producers are at the crux of the whole project,” Cammack said.
The five-year program encourages bison and cattle producers to implement conservation land management and grazing practices. They collect soil samples measuring microbes and other indicators of soil health and carbon sequestration as a result of the changes. The program also has a goal of introducing those producers to new markets with customers interested in eco-friendly practices.

More than 100 producers, primarily raising cattle, were participating in the project at the time of termination. More were preparing to enroll this year. SDSU had eight faculty members working on the project, along with four other staff members and several graduate students, Cammack said. 
If re-awarded the funding later this summer, Cammack said the team will have a “busy fall” collecting soil samples before the ground freezes.
The grant cancellation is “interruptive,” she added, but her group is “nimble” and “research projects never go perfectly.”
The grant cancellation comes during a period of broader concern about university research funding. Federal funding for science is the lowest in years due to cuts made by the Trump administration and has been declining for decades as a share of gross domestic product.
President Donald Trump proposed “draconian cuts” this spring, said Daniel Scholl, vice president of research and economic development at South Dakota State, to federal research funding agencies such as the USDA, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation – the three largest funding agencies from which SDSU receives research grants.
Scholl said he hopes Congress will resist the cuts, but is “uncertain where things will land.”
“We’re optimistic based on the efforts members of Congress are putting out to restore research funding and preserve the prowess of U.S. research and enterprise that’s largely driven by universities,” Scholl said.
If the university isn’t able to reinstate the remainder of its grant for the bison and cattle research project, Cammack said her team plans to apply for other grants and work with other partners to continue the program.

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Two decades ago, after a prolonged and heavy lift through the 2005 legislative session, former Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a monumental piece of legislation into law: establishing daylight saving time in the Hoosier State. 
The vote was so contentious that former House Speaker Brian Bosma left the voting machine open for hours, whipping up the votes needed to advance the priority bill for Daniels. 
“We just almost had a majority, and then people would switch,” Bosma, a Republican, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “We went up to caucus and I had to press on.”

In the end, lawmakers advanced the measure through the house by a single vote — a decision that cost the voting lawmaker his seat in the body.
Hoosiers first sprung forward in 2006.
Prior to the law, Indiana had a hodgepodge mashup of time zones that varied from county to county. As with today’s dynamic, most Hoosier counties aligned themselves with Eastern Time, but a handful located in the southwestern and northwestern tips opted for Central Time.
Just over a dozen counties clustered near the state’s borders — including all of the counties following Central Time and at least five Eastern Time counties — voluntarily followed daylight saving time with the majority of the nation. But roughly 76 counties didn’t, which meant they switched from Eastern Time to Central Time and vice versa when other states sprung forward or fell back. 
“There are 13 states with more than one, but Indiana had three (time zones),” said Daniels. “… as a practical matter, we were in the Eastern zone during the winter, and in the Central zone during the summer.”
Synchronizing all of the time zones to make it easier to do business with national counterparts was critical to Daniels’ first-term agenda, which sought to “make Indiana, once again, a competitive state.”
“Economically, we were at the bottom of people’s lists of places where you might bring jobs and do investment. We did dozens of things: taxes, regulation, litigation, building, infrastructure. Everything that might make Indiana a more attractive place and more prosperous place,” said Daniels. “And daylight savings was a small part of that.” 
Because of the confusing time zone distinctions — which The West Wing mocked in a famous 2002 episode — deliveries were missed or rescheduled, conference calls were dropped and even airlines avoided locating hubs in Indiana, Daniels said. 
“It’s an interconnected world, more so today than twenty years ago,” Daniels said. “… It used to be you’d have to look at the calendar before you look at your watch.”
 Gettting it through the chamber

A 2005 story in the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette reported that 43 Republicans and eight Democrats pushed the proposal across the finish line. At noon, the vote stood at 49-48 but, 11 hours later, four Republicans changed their minds.
“I’ve introduced and closed on this bill so many times I’m running out of things to say,” said Rep. Jerry Torr, R-Carmel. Torr authored the 2005 measure and retired last year. “It’s past time for daylight saving time. Let’s get this bill passed.”
Bosma said his caucus identified five Republicans it believed could vote for the measure “without political consequence,” believing that Indiana was “losing economic development opportunities, big ones, because of the anomaly.”










I think that for those who were restless about the speed and the dimension of the changes that we were able to make, daylight savings time became a symbol.


– Former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels


“My clearest recollection is getting a call at about 10:30 (p.m.) from (Gov.) Mitch Daniels, while we were in caucus, and the governor saying, “Brian, just pull the plug on this,’” recalled Bosma. “And I said, ‘Governor, I’ve spent way too much capital on this not to complete the job.’”
Returning to the floor, the body still didn’t have the final votes needed, with the tally stuck at 50 votes. After some final debate, one vote flipped — and Bosma told the body’s parliamentarian to lock it in.
“And the 51st vote was the one person that I told, ‘Under no circumstances, are you to vote for this,’” Bosma said. “… Troy (Woodruff) was a Marine, and he saw a grenade and jumped on it despite instructions not to.”
Woodruff, a freshman lawmaker from southwestern Indiana, had a district split between counties observing daylight saving and those that didn’t. He said the final tally came after nearly a dozen rounds of voting, none of which were enough to either pass or kill the bill.
“More than anything, it was just … time to move on and move forward,” Woodruff told the Capital Chronicle. “I just thought, in my head, if this is one thing we can do for free that could help … we really need to do this.”
He went on to lose his seat, but Woodruff said he didn’t regret his actions — even if he still gets the occasional message about a decades-old vote.
“I still get emails to this day about daylight savings time,” he said. 
After his term in office, Woodruff was later appointed chief of staff to the Indiana Department of Transportation in 2012, resigning two years later before launching his own business and serving as president of a Fishers-based architecture firm.
 The conversation today

The tumultuous 2005 session left such scars that, decades later, some veteran lawmakers say they won’t touch the topic. 
“When I got to the General Assembly in 2010, there was a discussion where they said, ‘You can bring up bills for this, that and the other.’ But they said, ‘Whatever you do … don’t bring up the time zones,’” recalled Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange. 
Still, there’s usually a bill filed each year on the topic — though they don’t advance. In 2025, three bills were filed to exempt Indiana from daylight saving time but none moved.

Glick, whose district borders Michigan, acknowledged the difficulty for families navigating boundaries where crossing means gaining or losing an hour. Living at the western edge of the Eastern Time zone has its own drawbacks, with later sunrises and sunsets. 
“In the evening, it’s still daylight, and kids aren’t ready to go to bed,” Glick said. “… (or) your kids are standing out by the side of the road to catch the bus in the dark.”
Outside of potential safety issues for children, daylight saving time also appears to increase electricity consumption along with car emissions. In the weeks following a shift to and from daylight saving, health risks and accidents spike while productivity dips.
On the federal level, the biannual grumblings about changing the clocks revive the ongoing debate: should states move to a permanent standard time or a permanent daylight saving time? 
Moving to permanent daylight saving time would require federal permission — though both Arizona and Hawai’i use standard time year-round. In cases where the states made a change, like with Indiana, the U.S. Department of Transportation ultimately picks the time zone. 
But, perhaps due to the pushback from 2005, Indiana is one of just two states who haven’t advanced legislation or resolutions supporting a permanent, year-round time, according to NBC News. Nineteen other states support permanent daylight savings time while the remaining 27 favor standard time.
The Indiana Chamber of Commerce, a big supporter of the time zone legislation 20 years ago, said they wouldn’t be a fan of moving Indiana to permanent daylight saving time — as proposed by the federal “Sunshine Protection Act.”

Hooiers have to fall back one hour on Nov. 2.

“From our perspective, moving to that permanent observance is a significant departure from the established system that Indiana businesses have used since 2006,” said President and CEO Vanessa Green Sinders. “…If there was consensus around eliminating the semiannual clock change, our preference would be standard time because it better aligns with winter daylight patterns and supports morning operational needs for all of our companies.” 
Aligning all 92 counties with daylight saving time did bring a small, yet statistically significant job boost to the Hoosier state, but Daniels said it was also emblematic of a changing Indiana.
“I think that for those who were restless about the speed and the dimension of the changes that we were able to make, daylight savings time became a symbol,” Daniels said. “I can’t tell you how often people said, ‘Yeah, maybe (you’ll accomplish) the rest of all these plans, but you’ll never change that.’
“And I think when it did finally pass, it sent a message that we’d turned a corner here in Indiana and we intend to be a leader, not in the middle of the pack.”

They say recent state laws encouraging higher density development have led to more properties with multiple single family residences, or accessory dwelling units, squeezed onto them.
In some situations, the path to reach a front door is no more than 3 feet wide, too narrow to get a gurney through in a medical emergency and too little space to safely lean a ladder if there is a fire, they say.
Fire marshals are pressing the state Building Code Council to mandate a minimum 5-foot wide path to access any new home that does not face a street, alley or parking lot. 
“This poses a safety issue to firefighters, occupants and patients,” Dave Kokot, past president of the Washington State Association of Fire Marshals, told the council Friday.
Kokot filed a petition for an emergency rule change and hoped the Building Code Council would grant it in its Friday meeting. Instead, the panel opted to have one of its committees review the request. It will decide later whether to grant the request.
Some jurisdictions, like Vancouver, already have a 5-foot minimum standard.
The fire marshals’ proposal contains exceptions. For example, if a building has an approved automatic fire sprinkler system, a four-foot width would be allowed. If adopted, the new requirement would not be retroactive. Projects already submitted would not be subject to the change.
In Friday’s extensive debate, some council members questioned the degree to which this was an emergency. 
“It has not come into play in a lot of developments yet. We anticipate that it will,” Kokot said.
Others said they thought fire marshals already had the power to ensure adequate access into homes and buildings. Kokot said building officials can override fire officials but having a statewide requirement could make it harder.
Kokot said he realized this situation is an unintended consequence of the Legislature trying to come up with ways to address the housing shortage. “We are open to delaying implementation to a reasonable date to allow new projects to get through the process,” he said.
Patrick Hanks, codes and policy manager for the Building Industry Association of Washington, said the proposed change could be interpreted to require five feet of clearance around an entire accessory dwelling unit. That would choke off construction of ADUs because there would not be enough space to comply.
In an email, Hanks said detached accessory dwelling units, commonly called “mother-in-law” units, are often built within three feet of another structure, fence, or property line. This allows for increased density in areas that used to be zoned exclusively for single-family homes, he said.
“It’s one tool that helps improve housing affordability,” he said, adding BIAW will work on getting “more workable code language that will improve fire safety while reducing negative impacts to housing affordability, with a delayed implementation to give the industry time to adjust designs if they would be affected.”
Though the rule didn’t get adopted, Kokot said afterwards he’s glad they’re still talking about doing so.
“I am encouraged that the council, for the most part, acknowledges there is an issue,” he said. “I’d like to get the language done. I think we can.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/housing-construction.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-18 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Did it make me deserve what he did to me?’: How Mississippi denies domestic violence victims critical aid while letting their offenders off,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/18/did-it-make-me-deserve-what-he-did-to-me-how-mississippi-denies-domestic-abuse-victims-critical-aid-while-letting-their-offenders-off/,Crime victim Cheryl Baier felt further victimized by a justice system that denied her critical aid while giving her abuser one of the lightest sentences possible for an attack that left her homeless and with failing sight,"FOREST – Cheryl Baier pushed her car key into the ignition when her boyfriend approached her passenger window in a Walmart parking lot in Forest. Bilbo Faulkner then pushed the passenger door open, sat down beside her and began to punch. 
Baier saw red and black. Blood dripped from where her vision grew blurry. She screamed but only choked. He pried the car keys from her grasp and strangled her with her seatbelt. She cried for help as he hit. She reached for the horn. No honk. She felt one of her eyes come loose after what seemed like 20 blows.
“I was hoping he’d just knock me out and put me out of my misery. So I didn’t feel it no more,” Baier remembers.
It was dark outside at 9 p.m. The car was parked yards from the main entrance underneath a lamp. She had agreed to meet her boyfriend in the lot because it was a public space. Few shoppers stopped to see his fist against her face or hear her cries, though. She saw a couple pull their child away before she lost vision in her right eye. That’s when she says Faulkner threatened to burn down her house before speeding off in his car. A witness eventually called the police, who instructed the fire department to rush to her home.
When she arrived at the hospital, she wasn’t sure if she was alive.
Victimized by crime, Baier later found herself victimized by a justice system that denied her critical aid because she had a more than decade-old drug conviction, even while the system gave her abuser one of the lightest sentences possible for an attack that left her temporarily homeless and with failing sight. Even though Mississippi has long boasted long sentences and high incarceration rates, domestic abuse cases still rarely rise to felony status – and offenders in those cases receive lighter sentences than other protected classes.

Unable to cover the over $12,000 in medical bills, Baier, a convenience store clerk, filed a claim for crime victims’ compensation through the attorney general’s office. The maximum payout to cover medical bills is $15,000. After her night stay at the hospital and 10 days of recovery, she was able to return to work. Paid $10 per hour at 45 hours a week, she knew it’d be several years before she could pay off her medical debt.
Weeks out from her surgery, she pulled a letter from the mailbox and squinted to make out the writing. The attorney general’s office denied her claim because of her felony drug conviction from 13 years ago. Victims, she learned, must be five years out from the last day of their probation to qualify for the program. Baier was weeks away.
“My pain is just the same. My loss is just the same,” Baier said in an interview with Mississippi Today. “What happened to me had nothing to do with what I did over a decade ago.”
While five other states deny victims’ compensation for prior felony convictions, Mississippi and Louisiana count all felonies, including victimless and nonviolent ones. Mississippi is also unique in counting probation, post-release supervision and court-ordered drug treatments, among other programs sponsored by the Department of Corrections, as part of their incarceration time.
Nearly a quarter of denied applications between 2021 and 2023 were based on prior felony convictions. The amount the AG’s office paid out to cover medical costs for assaulted crime victims decreased by half each year from 2021 to 2023, from a total of $1,424,475 in 2021 to $534,026 in 2023.

“The rules can unintentionally create barriers, and we must stay mindful of the fund’s original purpose,” said Stacey Riley, who provides shelter to 25 children and 30 adults through the Gulf Coast Center for Nonviolence in Biloxi. “Administrators should approach this work with an understanding of survivors’ trauma, their specific needs, and the often challenging environments in which they live.”
Some justice
In the months after her assault and the arson at her home, Baier lived out of a camper parked in her front yard. She wore a purse around her neck with a deer-skinning knife inside. Some nights she wet herself, too afraid to push open the RV door and use the restroom in her burnt home. She stayed up most nights with a pain in her mouth and eyes, unable to rest after working double shifts at the convenience store.

She lived for her day in court when restitution would be set and she could deliver her statement. She wrote out the facts on a piece of loose-leaf paper for the judge, jury and court officers to hear. She had June 2 marked on the calendar on her phone and in her kitchen. She called the district attorney’s office and the victim service coordinator each week, checking to make sure she had the date of the hearing correct.
She missed 15 days of work for court, many of them earlier trial dates that were bumped. She missed close to a month from surgery that eased her right eye back into its socket. In total, she estimates that she lost about $5,800 in wages.
When the hearing date arrived, Baier waited in a room in the courthouse with a printout of her victim impact statement. She was told to come back the next day when Faulkner would only plead. Restitution was set the next day, too. The victim service coordinator promised to let her know when she’d get a chance to tell her story in court and impress upon the judge the need for a substantial restitution payment. Baier waited for hours.
During the hearing, District Attorney Chris Posey remarked, “This does come with the approval of the victim in this case who I’ve spoken with many times and believe is actually in the courthouse today although not in the room at the moment.” But Baier said Posey never spoke to her about the plea deal.
The Victims’ Bill of Rights entitles victims to be present for all hearings before a judge. Baier wasn’t present to dispute the characterization of the attack she experienced. Posey attributed the attack to “some type of argument” between Faulkner and Baier.
Faulkner pleaded guilty to three years for aggravated domestic violence with time served for the 767 days spent in the Scott County jail for assaulting a jail guard. Restitution was set at $14,000 shy of the amount Baier asked for. She would get $2,000 at the end of the month – with the rest paid in $150 monthly installments once Faulkner’s court fines and fees were paid. The clerk then let her know she could leave.
Faulkner was also assigned an anger management course that he already took for a prior assault.
In an interview with Mississippi Today, Posey said that because the hearing took place in the courthouse while jury selection was happening for a separate trial, it would’ve been impossible for Baier to give her statement. The hearing was in the judge’s chambers, not the courtroom.
The victim service coordinator in the case refused a request for comment by Mississippi Today.
“What was said was further from the truth because that just makes it seem like he’s responding instead of the psychopathic behavior it truly was,” Baier said. “There was no foundation.”
Six percent of domestic violence cases were prosecuted as felony domestic aggravated assault in 2024, according to data from the Mississippi Administrative Office of Courts compiled by the Center for Violence Prevention.
“Too often, the gravity of domestic violence is misunderstood,” Riley said. “These are not simply individuals who ‘can’t get along’ with their partners — they are perpetrators of violence, many of whom will go on to commit even more serious crimes.”
On the street where she lives

Baier was pulling out of her driveway in Pulaski in Smith County when she saw a familiar face picking up a neighbor’s trash bin – and dumping the contents into the compactor. It was Faulkner. He was wearing the county jail striped orange pants. They locked eyes as she passed him on the gravel road by her house.
“There was no guard,” Baier said. “The way he beat me in the Walmart parking lot in front of God and everybody – you think he would hesitate in front of that trucker or another inmate?”
Mississippi Today was able to confirm that Faulkner, convicted of aggravated domestic violence along with two other prior violent felonies, was made a trusty at the Smith County jail — and was on work detail as a garbage collector on her street.
When Mississippi Today brought this to the Smith County Sheriff’s Department’s attention, the sheriff relayed that Faulkner was no longer in the program. He didn’t know Faulkner had been convicted, he was only going off the man’s criminal record in his county. 
Mississippi Department of Corrections policies prohibit inmates convicted of violent felonies, including aggravated domestic violence, from serving as trusties.
“Much of the problem comes down to communication,” said Riley, whose organization operates in 24 municipal justice courts in the lower six counties in Mississippi. “The issue isn’t that our justice system fails to act — it’s that it has long operated in silos. This entrenched way of functioning must change if we are to respond more effectively to interpersonal violence.”
In 2022, Attorney General Lynn Fitch established the Mississippi Domestic Violence Registry, which gives law enforcement access to information helpful for keeping law enforcement, victims and bystanders safe when answering domestic violence calls. It has been “a little slow” to get cooperation from agencies, said Michelle Williams, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, as officers have a lot of competing paperwork requirements. In an attempt to reduce this, Fitch’s office incorporated the registry into existing law enforcement reporting platforms.
Luke Thompson, former Byram police chief, said it was hard to convince his deputies to investigate domestic violence cases. He advocated for the attorney general’s office’s registry to be incorporated into the National Incident Based Reporting System, administered by the FBI.
Domestic violence cases require dual reporting and more paperwork than other cases. Officers are expected to determine a primary aggressor, which requires more discretion. Since 1992, just over a third of shootings of officers happened during domestic violence calls, Thompson found in his agency’s data.
Since retiring as chief, Thompson has been helping Mississippi agencies implement the Lethality Assessment Program, a questionnaire that helps law enforcement identify victims and serial abusers in their communities. The program helped his department connect victims with services faster and provide prosecutors with a more thorough history of abuse.
“It’s one of the hardest types of cases to sort through,” Thompson said. “Cops focus on ‘bad guys.’ We’re empathetic to victims. But sometimes we don’t always take that extra step to get a victim’s help.”
‘There was nothing in his eyes’
While the father of Baier’s children was incarcerated, he had sent Faulkner to be her protector. She felt taken care of by Faulkner, with his wide back and a muscular frame. She remembers the first day he arrived at the convenience store where she worked. She was drawn to the kindness he showed to another single mother. He provided money to her when she fell behind on car payments.
They were friends before they began dating. She enjoyed going on evening drives listening to “Good Ol’ Girl” by Frank Foster around Smith County when they were both off work. She knew he had been to prison, was first put off by his many tattoos, but was taken by his “big heart.”
For one month, he had been living with Baier, who was surprised when he announced he would be moving out. He had recently begun accusing her of cheating, which she thought was a joke. A relative of Faulkner’s attributes his behavior to untreated bipolar disorder. Baier said that he had been drinking alcohol. 
Before that day at Walmart, when he assaulted her, Baier had never seen his violent side. He asked to meet up while she was still working at the convenience store that night. She chose a public space because “there was nothing in his eyes.” He just looked different, she said.

“It was premeditated,” Baier said, clutching a charred family photo in her Smith County home. “That’s part of what’s gotten me all this time.”
Although she was able to clean her house, the smell of smoke persists. The fire damaged a photograph of four generations of her family. It was the last picture she had with her grandfather before he died from cancer.
Baier is well known in her community. She meets most locals as a clerk at a popular store in Forest where checks are cashed. She knows the farmhands who buy equipment and the waitresses at the local restaurants. Young and old, from out of town and native, they all chat with her at the store.
Lately, she’s been acting as her own investigator. She collected a list of witnesses from her assault as well as to the arson to hand to authorities. She helped the boss at her place of work transfer security footage onto a flash drive to capture the moment Faulkner entered the convenience store earlier in the night of her assault when he allegedly bought alcohol. The arson at her home has not gone to trial. No witnesses have been interviewed.
Her first eye surgery wasn’t considered a success because the muscles and tissues were damaged, pushing her right eye forward and causing pressure and migraines.
In a handwritten letter to the crime victim compensation director, Baier wrote, “After the fire, all I had was the torn, blood stained clothes on my back. My home was not habitable for four months. I’m telling you all this so you can understand the great financial strain, not to mention the physical and emotional damage that I will probably always suffer.”
Over half of completed victim compensation claims were denied in Scott County between 2021 and 2023, according to records obtained by Mississippi Today. Thirteen were denied and 11 were approved with an award. 
“When I got your denial and read the explanation, I felt abused and victimized all over again in a different way but just as damaging. Does a mistake from 13 years ago make me any less of a victim? Does it make what happened to me any less painful? Did it make me deserve what he did to me?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/06081232/Shirley-Baier-1.jpg,,,2025-08-18 07:58:03.330138

Paul Sarlo, a Democrat who chairs the Senate’s budget panel. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The $700 million-plus in projects state lawmakers added to this year’s budget favored competitive districts and those represented by Democrats, according to a New Jersey Monitor analysis of budget documents recently made public.
A review of the nearly 600 budget resolutions approved as part of this year’s $58.8 billion annual spending bill found that municipal and school district aid approved outside of the state’s formulaic awards and competitive grants flowed almost exclusively to areas represented by Democrats. The budget cleared the Legislature on June 30, but the resolutions were not made public until Aug. 8.
In New Jersey, lawmakers and officials with the other branches of government can seek changes to the budget the governor proposes in February by submitting requests for funding or language changes through budget resolutions.
Because funding introduced as a result of budget resolutions often skirts the public dialogue that surrounds New Jersey’s annual spending bill, they are sometimes derisively called “pork” or “Christmas tree items,” though some legislators view them differently.

“I look at budget resolutions through two very distinct lenses: One is what can be the most impactful things in partnership with my local leaders for their towns, and secondarily from a broader statewide perspective, things that fit not only the legislative agenda that we try to push, which is affordability and accessibility of state services,” said Sen. Troy Singleton (D-Burlington), the chamber’s Democratic caucus chair.
Legislators who secure budget resolutions that send money to their districts don’t hide that fact — they announce it.
Senate Democrats in recent days have boosted resolutions sponsored by Singleton and others that provided $8 million for Rowan University for what would be the state’s first veterinary school and $200,000 for lighting upgrades at Cinnaminson’s municipal complex. 
“We were having children and seniors coming out of that building into dark parking lots and dark avenues. We have a ballot box that sits right there,” said Singleton. “What we tried to do is listen and then be responsive to those we work for, and the local community said this is something that matters to them.”
Promoting state funding for local projects becomes especially important during election years. This November, Democrats are hoping to retain control of the governor’s seat and the Assembly.
Though budget resolutions that send money to specific projects, municipalities, or school districts often face criticism, they are seldom the largest tranches of spending approved this way.
This year, the largest items dealt with university funding or state revenue. Those included a $76 million resolution to boost financing of a fund that supports some costs related to NJ FamilyCare, the state’s Medicaid program, and $70 million to reverse a cut to aid for universities that graduate low-income students.
Either one of those appropriations alone exceeds the roughly $62.1 million sent directly to school districts as a result of budget resolutions.
 Most funding went to Democrats

Democratic legislative districts had a near monopoly on money disbursed to towns and school districts as a result of budget resolutions.
Legislative districts represented by Republicans received additional school funding via budget resolutions in only two cases, and in both, the investments touched on areas represented by Democrats.
West Essex Regional School District, which serves students from Essex Fells, Fairfield, North Caldwell, and Roseland, received $150,000 through a resolution sponsored by Sen. Vin Gopal (D-Monmouth) and other Democrats. The regional school district’s towns span the Republican-held 40th District and the Democrat-dominated 27th District.
The Lenape Regional School District received $1 million for capital improvements. Its towns fall fully within the 8th Legislative District, which is represented by Sen. Latham Tiver (R-Burlington), Assemblyman Michael Torrissi (R-Burlington), and Assemblywoman Andrea Katz (D-Burlington). The 8th is one of only two New Jersey legislative districts with split partisan representation.
Budget resolution funding to municipalities showed a similar dynamic. Towns in legislative districts with Republican representation received direct funds through budget resolutions in only three instances, including one covering the 30th District in Monmouth and Ocean counties, the other New Jersey legislative district with split partisan representation.
Together, those line items amounted to roughly $2.3 million. In total, nearly $83 million for municipalities was approved through the budget resolution process.
The New Jersey Monitor’s review singled out budget resolutions that sent money directly to school districts or municipalities. The tallies do not include money that went to counties or private institutions within a given legislative district that may have reduced some municipal costs for certain projects.
The New Jersey Monitor identified only one instance among the 585 budget resolutions approved this year where the first prime sponsor was a Republican.
Sen. Bob Singer’s (R-Ocean) resolution awarded $1 million for a Lakewood food and clothing assistance charity to purchase a warehouse (Singer’s district is also represented by a Democrat, Assemblyman Avi Schnall). GOP members appeared as co-sponsors on five other resolutions.
The imbalance is unsurprising. Democrats control both legislative chambers and the governorship, limiting Republicans’ influence in budget negotiations. To some degree, it is intentional, even on the side of GOP members.
 Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth), the chamber’s GOP budget officer, said he encouraged his members to avoid seeking budget resolution funding.
“The message to all our members was we need to not be part of the problem here,” he said, adding, “If everybody’s job in the Legislature is to bring home the bacon, the pig dies pretty quickly.”
Nor is the imbalance necessarily new. A more cursory review of budget resolutions approved for the 2023 fiscal year that did not measure appropriation levels revealed just three measures where a Republican was a prime sponsor. A review of resolutions from fiscal year 2018 found a single budget resolution with a GOP co-sponsor and none with Republican prime sponsors.
“They’ve been trying to say it’s always been like this. That’s bullsh*t. It has not always been like this. This is so blatant,” said O’Scanlon.
 Competitive districts

Competitive legislative districts were likely to benefit from budget resolution funding, though other districts received greater amounts of funding as a result of legislators’ requests.
The 28th and 29th Districts — which include portions of Newark and are considered safely Democratic — received a combined $24.7 million in school aid, chiefly due to a resolution that awarded Newark public schools $21 million for capital expenses.
The 36th District was the only one to see at least half as much budget resolution school funding.
The district, which is represented by Sen. Paul Sarlo (D-Bergen), the Senate’s budget chair, received roughly $17 million in school and municipal aid as a result of budget resolutions. More than half of that money was for school capital improvements in Wood-Ridge ($9.5 million), where Sarlo is mayor.
A similar dynamic played out in the 38th District, which got $9.5 million as a result of budget resolutions.
Though Democrats are perennially concerned about a Republican upset in the 38th District — a Bergen County district that includes towns like Paramus and Lodi — the 36th has generally not been considered competitive. There’s some reason to think that could change this year: President Donald Trump carried both districts in last year’s presidential race.
“If a legislator is threatened, if their district is more at risk, they get greater consideration,” said Marc Pfeiffer, a senior policy fellow at Rutgers University’s Center for Urban Research who has long experience in state and local government.
Pfeiffer added that other factors, like a legislator’s relationships with caucus leaders or an ability to fundraise, also play a role in how budget resolution funding could be spread.
“It’s that combination of factors that us mere mortals are not necessarily privy to or, in some cases, capable of understanding,” he said.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Troubled venture capital company Elevate Ventures has been deemed “in breach of” lending language in all of its active loan agreements with the Indiana Economic Development Corp. after defaulting on an angel investment program this month.
David Watkins, IEDC’s senior vice president of entrepreneurship and small business, gave the firm 30 days to cure the breaches before it nears default on those agreements.
In a Wednesday letter, he asked Elevate Ventures to provide a detailed financial plan and schedule, also within 30 days, to “demonstrate how it will be able to fulfill all of its outstanding obligations” — and why the IEDC shouldn’t make all outstanding loans due immediately.
The agency has “unreconciled, ongoing concern” that the company, “in its current state, will be unable to fulfill any of its current or future obligations,” Watkins wrote.
Elevate Ventures did not reply to multiple requests for comments.
The firm operates the Indiana Angel Network Fund, intended to entice and aid angel investments to Hoosier startups. It nabbed the contract with IEDC on Aug. 2, 2011, with repayment due exactly 14 years later.
IEDC sent a request for repayment of nearly $17.2 million the day before. Elevate Ventures repaid about $12.9 million on Aug. 4 — falling more than $4.3 million short.
That prompted another letter, this time a notice of payment default that requested full payment within five business days. The Aug. 5 document warned that the unpaid principal balance would rack up interest at 8%, or about $956 daily.
Elevate Ventures failed to pay in full by Aug. 12, constituting an “event of default” under the contract. Watkins’ letter, sent the next day, noted more than $7,000 in interest had accumulated.
The company offered to repay with a new loan from the returns of the Indiana 21st Century Research and Technology Fund, according to Watkins.
“However, this proposal appears to merely utilize assets designated to pay back other future obligations to pay back the Loan, which would only impair the ability to repay those other obligations,” he wrote in the letter.
IEDC also froze all accounts related to Elevate Ventures. Monthly payments on a separate professional services agreement during the “period of open collaboration” and  specific investments that were allocated capital at an IEDC board meeting in June are explicitly approved, however.
The company’s repayment struggle comes about three months after it was dubbed an “entity of interest” — alongside IEDC and its nonprofit arm — in a forensic investigation of potential financial wrongdoing.
The contract with FTI Consulting began May 13 and lasts one year. It’s worth up to $800,000 and will be paid for by IEDC funds, according to Commerce Secretary David Adams.
Gov. Mike Braun promised an audit just days after Indiana Legislative Insight reported allegations of self-dealing, unreported side gigs and more among IEDC and its partners.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)For years, Idaho state lawmakers have worried the federal government might cut Medicaid funds.
That’s partly why the Legislature didn’t expand Medicaid to more low-income earners. In 2018, voters approved that policy through a ballot initiative.
Now, as many states brace for federal cuts and policy changes to Medicaid under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Republicans in Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, Idaho is well-positioned to handle the changes, said Idaho Sen. Julie VanOrden, who chairs the state Senate’s Health and Welfare Committee.

The Pingree Republican pointed to a range of Idaho’s systems that other states are looking to set up, like a panel of state lawmakers to oversee contracts and an emergency fund to deal with higher-than-expected costs.
“A lot of it came from the rising cost of Medicaid. So I think we have that in common with what the federal government is looking at,” she told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
But the new law passed by Congress gets in the way of Idaho’s plan to tap into one tool to pay providers more for Medicaid services, by capping state-set payment rates.

 Medicaid pays a portion of what health care services cost. Mega bill caps payments to providers. 

Medicaid, which insures around one-fifth of Americans, often pays much lower than what it costs health care providers to give out services. 
That’s why in April 2024, the federal agency that regulates Medicaid allowed states to require private companies that manage Medicaid benefits to pay providers rates for services as high as commercial insurance plans pay. 
In the future, Idaho plans to use that structure, called state-directed payments, as part of a new large Medicaid cost-cutting bill approved by the state Legislature this spring that will shift all Idaho Medicaid benefits to being run by private companies. That model, called managed care, is used widely across the country. 
Idaho Medicaid to be privately managed in 2029, health officials expect

The bill didn’t spell out how high Idaho’s state-directed payments would be. But VanOrden said lawmakers were “banking on” getting the average commercial state-directed payment rates.
“Certainly, it’s a disappointment that we won’t be able to apply for those waivers anymore to get that average commercial rate, which we were banking on,” she said.
But she doesn’t think losing that higher rate will affect Idaho’s funding plans as part of the shift to managed care.
The new federal law caps Medicaid state-directed payments at as high as rates for Medicare, which reimburses more but still not as much as providers say the true treatment costs are. 
The mega law’s new cap on state-directed payments won’t affect the status quo in Idaho, Idaho Medicaid Deputy Administrator Sasha O’Connell told a state legislative panel last month. It could limit Idaho’s ability to raise that in the future, she added. 
But the status quo in Idaho — which has the worst doctor shortage in the nation — isn’t really ideal, Idaho Hospital Association CEO Brian Whitlock told the Idaho Capital Sun.
“Status quo is we’re still 50th in the nation in physicians per capita. Status quo means we’re still having a workforce shortage throughout the health care system,” he said. “Status quo still means that more than half of our rural hospitals have less than a 1% operating margin, which is razor thin. Status quo means some of our hospitals are well below the standard of days cash on hand to operate. Status quo means you’re going to wait months to get in to see a specialist.”

States with state-directed payment rates higher than the new cap will have to ratchet down over time. That means Idaho’s new ceiling for state-directed payments will be every other state’s floor, Whitlock said.
“It may take some states 10 years to ratchet down and get to the Idaho level of 100% of Medicare,” he said. “And in the meantime, every other state that is participating in state directed payment programs has a distinct competitive advantage over Idaho, including our neighboring states.”
 Idaho was already working toward Medicaid work requirements, more eligibility checks

But some other new Medicaid changes that are part of the new mega law might not affect Idaho as much.
The new federal law calls for Medicaid work requirements and twice-a-year eligibility checks. The Idaho Legislature already passed a law this year to ask the federal government for permission to do that.
And Idaho’s status quo won’t be affected by new federal limits on taxes on health care providers, which states use to access more federal funds, state health officials say. That’s because Idaho’s taxes on providers like hospitals and nursing homes are below the new caps, O’Connell said. 
How Congress’s megabill will impact Idaho: Cuts to taxes, Medicaid, SNAP and more

Idaho is also looking to tap into a new $50 billion, five-year rural health fund established through the new federal law. 
In a column published last month in the Times-News, Idaho’s U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo — a Republican who pushed for several aspects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — said Idaho wouldn’t be affected by the new Medicaid reforms on provider taxes and state-directed payments.
“Instead, Idaho’s rural hospitals will benefit from a new Rural Health Transformation Program that allocates money to all states, not just those using gimmicks to draw down more federal money,” Crapo wrote.
For five years, Idaho could receive $100 million each year from the fund, he said.
“This is arguably the single largest investment in rural health care in more than 20 years,” Crapo wrote in the column for the Twin Falls newspaper. “While it provides a way for states that do rely disproportionately on federal funding to make a financial plan, states like Idaho can provide immediate relief to rural hospitals and establish the tools necessary to be successful in the future.”
Over the next decade, the bill is expected to cut federal funds for Idaho Medicaid by $4.3 billion and reduce Idaho Medicaid’s enrollment by as much as 40,000 people, estimates in early June from the group Manatt show. The analysis assumes work requirements will cut Medicaid enrollment and costs.

(Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern) Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

As lawmakers mull penalizing libraries that allow children to access inappropriate books, opponents have quoted the Bible and lawmakers have read lists of sex acts.
The post Debate over sexual material in Wyoming libraries is heating up… and getting awkward appeared first on WyoFile .","Rev. Dan Odell wore his clerical collar to address lawmakers on the Joint Judiciary Committee on Tuesday evening in Casper.
The Methodist pastor wanted the committee to know that if a bill to ban books containing sexually-explicit material from the children’s sections of Wyoming libraries passed as currently written, it could block minors from one book many lawmakers might say is their favorite: the Bible. 
To illustrate his point, Odell read aloud some of the religious text’s more graphic passages, like this one from the Book of Ezekiel: 
“She lusted after her lovers, whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses,” Odell read. 
That passage was one of five containing what Odell called “frank descriptions of sexual acts,” that he read or cited for the committee. The reverend had more examples, he told lawmakers, than his allotted time for public comment on the bill would permit.
A notable swathe of Wyoming legislators have joined a nationwide movement of social conservatives who say sexually explicit content, mostly in books written for young LGBTQ+ readers, is corrupting children. They hope to keep minors from seeking out, or stumbling upon, sexual material in Wyoming libraries. As the packed committee room in Casper suggested, their opposition, largely led by the state’s educators and librarians, is growing larger and more organized.

And as demonstrated by Odell’s testimony, the debate is injecting an unusually carnal note into Wyoming politics. 
That includes the language of the bill draft itself, which requires public and school library employees to make sure sexually explicit materials aren’t available to minors, or face severe penalties. Like other conservative social issue measures the Wyoming Legislature has passed recently, the bill would let citizens sue institutions they catch violating the new rules. 
The draft contains a six-point definition of sexual acts that cannot be depicted in literature available to a minor. The definitions include graphic descriptions like “ejaculation onto the person of another” or “contact between the mouth and genitalia or mouth and anus,” that are a far cry from the often staid and technical language of statute. 
“Sorry if I get flush,” an embarrassed Rep. Jayme Lien said at the committee’s May meeting in Torrington, as the Casper Republican read the bill language, which mirrors statute passed in Iowa, to her colleagues. 
Staff attorneys from the Legislative Service Office have suggested that lawmakers could instead rely on a definition of “obscene materials” that already exists in Wyoming statute. That language describes obscene material as something the average person would find prurient or offensive — without getting into the detailed definitions proposed by Lien. But the existing language also notes that, to be considered legally obscene, the material in question, “taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”
That definition borrows from a pivotal U.S. Supreme Court decision, Miller v. California. In that decision, the justices found that for material to be considered obscene under the law it had to lack those other societal values. Rep. Anne Lucas, the Cheyenne Republican who has been a vocal proponent of the legislation to ban books, says the Miller test was written for adults, not children. 
“The Supreme Court, when they heard that case, it never occurred to them, I suspect, that we would be talking about this in reference to children and obscene materials,” she told lawmakers in Casper on Tuesday, as she argued against using the language suggested by legislative staff. The high court heard Miller v. California in 1973. 
The bill’s opponents argue lawmakers are flirting with unconstitutional suppression of free speech in their quest to legislate what books are available where. 
Though Odell, the pastor, didn’t name the Miller case, he echoed the justices’ notion that sexual imagery or language can be embedded in texts with deeper meaning. 
“I mention these not for the sake of sensationalism,” the clergyman said of the graphic biblical passages he read lawmakers, “but because they’re a part of larger passages that reflect spiritual and moral truths.”
Rep. Marlene Brady, a Green River Republican who’s been outspoken on her belief that sexually explicit content endangers minors, took issue with Odell’s quoting of scripture. 
“The Bible is a book of history,” she said, “and some of those passages you’re referring to in my understanding of the Bible is the creator’s message to the beauty of the relationship, of a marriage, between a man and a woman… so to use it as support for what I would consider immoral material, I just take offense to that.”

Lawmakers did not act on the legislation in Casper. After hearing two hours of public testimony, nearly all of which was in opposition to the bill, lawmakers postponed a vote on whether to sponsor it as a committee bill until an October meeting in Cheyenne. 
Opponents of the legislation include advocates for LGBTQ+ Wyomingites. They accuse lawmakers of taking aim specifically at books that help gay youth understand their sexuality, in a state that isn’t always welcoming to them. Some of the definitions of sexually explicit material appear to originate from passages of a book called “Gender Queer,” which has generated outrage among conservatives nationwide.
“Wyoming already has obscenity laws that protect us from material with no redeeming value,” Marylee White, a Teton County library board member, told lawmakers. “This proposal goes further, allowing one group’s personal beliefs about morality to dictate what all families can access.”
The meeting drew a packed room of librarians, educators and other opponents who said the measure would stifle free expression and erode the role of the state’s libraries as places Wyomingites, including young people, can go to explore. 
“It ruins what the library is,” Lindsey Travis, president of the Wyoming Library Association and head librarian in Sweetwater County, told the committee. Despite the graphic definitions, librarians remain concerned that the general ban on “sexually explicit” materials was so broad that it would be nearly impossible for them to police all the books available to teens and children. 
Opponents asked legislators to respect library professionals’ processes for selecting books, and the existing avenues people can take to request a text’s removal. Those structures allowed local communities, not distant politicians, to shape their library collections, Travis said. 
But many legislators believe it’s within their purview to regulate library books. Sheridan Republican Rep. Laurie Bratten cited a section of the Wyoming Constitution that deals with protecting Wyomingite’s morality. 
“As the health and the morality of the people are essential to their well-being, and to the peace and permanence of the state, it shall be the duty of the legislature to protect and promote these vital interests,” reads the section of constitution Bratten quoted.
Travis offered to pair librarians with lawmakers in a working group to see if the two parties could reach a better compromise than the current legislation, which exposes libraries and schools caught violating the new rules to a $50,000 fine for each offense. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Jared Olsen, R-Cheyenne, told Travis the committee would not pursue the working group, she told WyoFile on Wednesday. 
The committee will also not hear further public testimony in Cheyenne, Olsen said at the Casper meeting. 
Lawmakers’ email inboxes, however, may not be so spared. Committee members received hundreds of emails asking them to vote down the bill ahead of the Casper meeting, lawmakers said. More than 850 people answered a call from the political organizing group Better Wyoming to write and oppose the legislation, executive director Nate Martin told WyoFile. 
“Those aren’t just librarians,” Martin said. “Those are parents, those are people who care about their libraries and those are people who are tired of watching the Freedom Caucus advance their extremist religious agenda.” 
A majority in the state House of Representatives aligns with the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, whose members have pushed for regulating library books both at the statehouse and at the local government level. The Freedom Caucus notched up legislative wins last year after taking control of the House, but Martin predicted the group will see increased opposition on this particular issue. 
The response to the group’s call to write lawmakers opposing the legislation was “overwhelming and frankly larger than that on most issues we deal with,” said Martin, who also serves on Laramie’s school board.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Our colleges and universities are supposed to be embracing policies and programs that provide skills and experiences that set their students up for success in the professional workplace.
That’s why it’s so puzzling that Oklahoma’s third largest public university has decided the best way to position their journalism and communication students for success is by eliminating the print edition of its student-run newspaper, The Vista.
Administrators at the University of Central Oklahoma insist that abruptly ending printing a publication with a 122-year history is necessary because it will save the university $12,000 a year.
Student outcomes be darned.
To be clear, $12,000 equates to a few pennies at an institution that had an annual budget topping $170 million. This university’s governing body in 2023 also agreed to hire and pay President Todd Lamb, a former lieutenant governor, a guaranteed annual salary of $325,000 plus other benefits.
So this seemingly random pennypinching makes me wonder if this university is truly vested in setting its students up for success or if this amounts to someone at the highest levels attempting to censor the press. 
It’s also odd that the administration seemingly waited until just before the start of the school year to disclose it is essentially canceling The Vista when it’s probably too late for students to transfer to other universities that can better support their goals. (Keep reading for the digital media part of the news equation.)
The dean of UCO’s liberal arts college evidently believes the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and the Regional University System of Oklahoma, which both govern the school, have issued a “mandate” to be more efficient with resources. Leaders believe this is a good program to chop.
Late last week, a UCO student media governing board indicated it was under pressure, and that funding for other student-produced media would be withheld until they submitted a budget that didn’t include printing The Vista.
Our state regents, meanwhile, have been touting their blueprint for success, which they identify as a “bold strategic plan” that “emphasizes the key role Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities play in producing the state’s workforce.”
You know what my industry needs? College newspapers. 
But apparently higher education leaders don’t care about that.
Is this governing board actually envisioning an environment where we end hands-on learning and programs that give students real-world experiences that set them up for employment opportunities and internships?
If so, the public deserves to know that.
As someone who makes hiring decisions, I’m looking for employees that have training and experience. And I need higher education leaders who understand what my industry’s needs are.
In the journalism and communication fields, the building blocks for most future employees typically begin at the college paper.
For decades, student newspapers have served a tri-purpose. 
They give students the opportunity to try their hand at writing, editing and laying out the paper. It also doubles as a way to teach those who want to work in marketing, public relations or film how to write a usable press release, design and sell ads or make a pitch.
College newspapers also serve as a training ground for students who hope to land a professional internship or full-time job in the communications industry, and they signal to employers that schools are producing graduates that have some experience at that, which makes them marketable.
And, finally college newspapers inform their campuses about news that impacts them. Universities are their own miniature ecosystems, complete with housing, food services and education. It’s often the student journalists living or going to school who first hold their university leaders to account. UCO served over 12,000 students last year and is located in a community, Edmond, that no longer has a local daily news source.
Their media outlet is the one who revealed Lamb’s ridiculously large salary that I quoted.
Earlier this year, a UCO official reached out to me to ask if I supported a proposal to stop printing The Vista.
I told the university that I believed it should have at least one print edition a week to give students the experience of laying out papers, designing advertisements, writing punchy headlines that fit in small spaces and meeting deadlines.
While it’s true that more people are consuming their news online, print newspapers are still alive and kicking in communities across Oklahoma. Every community deserves to have talented journalists. And every paper is a business that has subscribers and people who rely on them to receive their news.
Last time I was on UCO’s campus, I picked up a copy of The Vista and looked through the articles to see if there might be someone who would be a good fit for our summer internship.
I was on campus because our newsroom is partnering with a UCO reporting class to give participants – many of whom are first-generation college students – an opportunity to have a story professionally published online and in print. That can give them a leg up in the hiring process after they graduate.
Imagine how disheartening it is to find out UCO’s administration doesn’t see the same potential.
I’ve also worked with papers in this state, which have struggled to find people to work at their publications with the basic skillsets, which includes the ability to lay out a print edition. I myself have had difficulty finding college students who have state government reporting experience.
That should be a clear SOS to leaders of our universities that there’s a disconnect and that scrimping isn’t working.
I did tell UCO that it needed to invest in and beef up The Vista’s website because it’s not very user friendly.
Either way, UCO has reached a point where it either needs to put up or shut up. If a college doesn’t want to invest in the tools needed to make this degree successful, they need to end it and stop accepting tens of thousands in tuition money from those students.
Because students need to know their degree will lead to opportunities, and they trust colleges and universities to have policies in place to help them achieve their goals. Employers desperately need an educated workforce that meets their needs.
We can’t cut our way to greatness. 
It’s unfortunate that UCO has resorted to prioritizing pennies over its students.

A committee voted to sponsor three failed bills from the 2025 session that would continue the overhaul of Wyoming’s elections system. 
The post As Wyoming lawmakers rehash election reforms, two familiar camps remain divided appeared first on WyoFile .","As they have before, lawmakers gathered Friday to debate a bevy of bills aimed at redesigning the state’s elections. And like before, hours of testimony before the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee appeared to do little to change anyone’s mind. 
Those who have aligned themselves with Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray and his election-reform agenda were steadfast, while those who have been skeptical of the years-long pursuit to revamp the state’s elections remained skeptical. 
Lawmakers filed 45 election-related bills in the 2025 general election — accounting for about 8% of all legislation in both the House and the Senate. A fraction became law. 
In May, the committee voted to reanimate 10 of the bills after Gray asked lawmakers to consider roughly 20 bills from the last session. Then an 11th election-related bill was added to Friday’s agenda. 
“It’s probably the thing that Wyoming gets right more than anything in the whole country, is our elections. And we have for a long time, and we keep messing with it,” committee co-chairman Sen. Cale Case, R-Lander, said at the meeting in Casper. 
Ultimately, a majority of the committee saw things differently from Case, voting to sponsor three pieces of legislation and draft a new version of a fourth to be discussed at a November meeting. 
As for the seven other bills revived in May, the committee voted to make the final decision on their fate at the November meeting. Lingle Republican Sen. Cheri Steinmetz offered that suggestion as the meeting ran long. 
“I really think these are important bills, and we have a lot of public testimony on some of these, and then we’ll also have to work them,” she said. 
One of the bills to earn the committee’s sponsorship would require counties to use pen and paper as the default method to mark ballots for elections in Wyoming. For 22 of the state’s 23 counties, the bill would have little effect.
In Laramie County, where touch-screen voting machines have long been used, the change could “completely upend” elections, according Debra Lee, the local county clerk. 
The committee also voted to sponsor a bill banning ballot drop boxes and to move a bill to the next meeting to ban ballot harvesting. Gray has had his sights on the two prohibitions since running for secretary of state in 2022. 
Lastly, lawmakers voted to adopt a bill to clean up language related to Wyoming’s new voter registration law requiring proof of state residency and U.S. citizenship during voter registration. A federal court recently tossed a lawsuit challenging the new requirements as unconstitutionally vague and imposing an undue burden on the right to vote. 
The committee’s next meeting is Nov. 3 in Cheyenne.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.
One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
 States in a ‘very, very strong position’

Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
 A ‘substantial headache’

Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

The Education Future Fund (EFF) was designed in 2023 to lower property taxes while supporting school districts by providing resources that weren’t covered under Nebraska’s existing […],"Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood laugh after he signs a mock check signifying state investments in K-12 education. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A fund marketed as a sustainable source of state aid to Nebraska’s K-12 schools is on track to be completely depleted within five years of its creation.
The Education Future Fund (EFF) was designed in 2023 to lower property taxes while supporting school districts by providing resources that weren’t covered under Nebraska’s existing school funding formula. It launched with an initial investment of $1 billion and a commitment from state lawmakers to add another $250 million each year thereafter to keep it stable.
At the time, Gov. Jim Pillen said he hoped to build the fund to approximately $2.5 billion by 2029-30, but the state is spending money faster than it can grow. After that first $1 billion investment, expenses out of the fund have far exceeded revenue transfers into it by more than $150 million each year.
The Education Future Fund is now baked into Nebraska’s current school funding formula. Among other things, EFF offers per-pupil funding primarily to non-equalized school districts and assumes a higher level of state funding for special education.
Based on the fund’s projected ending balance in the state’s latest biennial budget and the trajectory of steadily increasing EFF expenses each year, if lawmakers only add the standard $250 million to the fund in fiscal year 2027-28, it will not have enough funds to cover its expenses by the end of that year, according to a Nebraska Examiner analysis.
This appears to be one of the worst-kept secrets among Nebraska state government and local education officials. Five school board members representing districts across the state told the Examiner that their boards had doubts about EFF’s lasting power when the fund was first introduced.

Tim Royers, president of the Nebraska State Education Association, said lawmakers also know about this. When he approached Education Committee members in the Nebraska Legislature this session about adding resources to EFF, he said even his low-cost requests were rejected because lawmakers said there wasn’t enough money in the fund to support them.
Brad Wilkins, a board member for Ainsworth Community Schools, was on the task force that developed the idea for EFF. He said members of the governor’s staff claimed the fund would be sustainable for 10 years, but he said he questioned the estimate even then.
This touches on a longstanding lack of trust Nebraska’s education community has in the reliability of state government as a funding partner, Wilkins said. Lawmakers constantly ask school boards to lower their levy rates — and sometimes seek to cap them — while promising to take care of the districts if they comply, but they don’t always hold up their end of the bargain, Wilkins said.
“Some of those promises are hard to keep,” he said. “We need to keep this one.”
Despite the fiscal challenges, Pillen said he remains committed to ensuring the Education Future Fund remains alive. Lee Will, chief operating officer for Nebraska’s Department of Administrative Services, said the current plan is to increase the revenue transfers going into the fund.
“Fixing Nebraska’s property tax crisis while investing in our kids are my top goals as governor,” Pillen said in a statement. “We will ensure that the funding in the Education Future Fund is sustainable for generations to ensure we never give up on any kid in Nebraska.”
Where that additional revenue will come from, however, is a question that remains unanswered.
Foundation aid
The two biggest expenses out of the fund also come with the biggest statewide impacts: foundation aid and special education reimbursements.
Foundation aid was pitched as a way to support the vast majority of Nebraska’s 244 school districts that don’t receive equalization aid, what many know as state aid to K-12 schools. Foundation aid is a per-pupil funding mechanism that offers districts $1,500 for each student, minus any equalization aid the district already receives. Foundation aid costs roughly $112 million each year out of the fund.
Foundation aid’s impact largely depends on the district. At Lincoln Public Schools, Baier said they didn’t get much of a funding boost from foundation aid because the district already received a high amount of equalization aid.
But for smaller school districts like Ainsworth and West Point Public Schools, foundation aid makes a huge difference. Steven Blocher, board member at West Point, said the only state aid the district received prior to EFF’s implementation was allocated income taxes, which brought the district roughly $140,000 per year.
Foundation aid alone boosted West Point’s state aid by $1 million, Blocher said, and state special education reimbursements added another $360,000. He said the extra support helped the board approve an increase to teacher salaries.
In Ainsworth, Wilkins said foundation aid brought his district’s state aid from roughly $40,000 per year to about $450,000. He said that money was used nearly dollar-for-dollar to reduce the amount of property tax funds sought to operate their schools.
Special education reimbursements
Special education reimbursements make up an even larger chunk of the annual EFF payouts, ranging from $246 million in the fund’s first year to a projected $309 million in 2026-27. When the fund was created, lawmakers also approved increasing the state’s share of special ed costs covered from 40% to 80%. The program is largely split among federal and state funds, along with money from local school districts.
The demand for special ed services has been higher than both state and education officials expected, which is why the expenses have grown so much. Dave Welsch, board member for Milford Public Schools, said over the last decade his district’s special ed population has doubled.
Several other board members said their district’s special ed costs have increased much faster than they expected. This change is a factor in eroding the sustainability of the EFF in its current state, but it also brings the most consistent benefits from the fund to school districts, regardless of size.
Milford, for example, is “on the bubble” of Nebraska’s equalization formula, Welsch said, so the district can’t count on that support every year. But its reimbursements have raised the state aid the district receives by more than $600,000 each year.
LPS doesn’t receive much in foundation aid because of its equalization aid, but Baier said the special education funding has helped the district stabilize its budgets.

Levies
A big purpose of the EFF was to encourage school boards to lower local property tax asking — the amount of money sought from local property taxpayers to fund schools — by providing the additional state support. That strategy appears to have worked, to some degree.
All five board members who spoke with the Examiner said their local levy rates had either dropped or remained level since the EFF was created.

Will noted that since 2023, school district property taxes have risen 1.7% year-over-year. He argued this is a sign that the fund is working, because city and county property taxes have risen 5.5% and 4.7%, respectively.
Steve Koch, board member for Hershey Public Schools, said EFF aid helped his board lower the local levy rate by more than 15%, reducing Hershey’s overall tax asking by roughly $400,000.
At West Point, Blocher said the board was able to lower the district’s levy from over 69 cents in 2022-23 to 57 cents in 2024-25.
Milford’s levy rate has been rising over time from 84 cents in 2019-20 to 93 cents in 2024-25, Welsch said. He argued that due to rising property valuations and the district’s equalization aid dropping, Milford’s levy growth likely would have been much higher without EFF support.
At Omaha Public Schools, the largest school district in Nebraska, the district’s allocation of state aid remained relatively unchanged in the first year EFF was implemented in 2023-24. The following year, however, state aid to OPS jumped from roughly $285 million to more than $316 million, according to documents a district spokesperson sent the Examiner to review.
Over the same period, OPS also lowered its total levy rate from $1.21 to $1.10, the lowest it’s been in over a decade.
Multiple OPS board members either declined or ignored requests for comment in recent weeks.
What happens next?
If EFF were to suddenly dissolve, multiple board members said it would be “catastrophic” for their districts. Several board members said they would likely have no choice but to raise tax levies, though Wilkins noted that might be its own challenge due to levy caps state lawmakers also put in place that limit year-over-year increases.
Other board members said they may consider cuts to personnel costs, which consistently make up the biggest portion of school district budgets across Nebraska.

These worst case scenarios are unlikely, Will said, as he confirmed state officials remain committed to fueling the fund. At this point, he said the primary strategy is simply to increase the funds transferred into it.
While EFF was originally marketed as a largely self-sustaining system, Will argued it’s actually more sustainable for the state to control exactly how many dollars are going into it through transfers.
The only revenue source for EFF that isn’t a fund transfer is investment income, which is expected to drop from roughly $29 million in 2024-25 to about $16 million in 2025-26 and $11 million in 2026-27, according to state documents.
Many board members said they are nervous about the state having the money to make the fund whole, especially considering Nebraska’s current financial situation. This session, lawmakers grappled with a large projected deficit, which contributed to them reducing the amounts the state transferred into the EFF to $242 million for both years of the current biennium, rather than $250 million.
Nebraska is facing yet another projected deficit of about $95 million, according to the latest financial status, and Pillen has made clear his intention to cut the state budget an additional 10%, or roughly $500 million.
That prompts the question: If Nebraska is going to increase funding to EFF, where would that money come from?
Lou Ann Linehan, a former state senator from the Elkhorn area who helped develop the fund, had doubts that state revenues would actually be that bad when push comes to shove. She recalled during her first year in office in 2017 that revenue forecasts predicted a budget deficit of more than $1 billion.
This turned out to be an inaccurate reading, as lawmakers ended that year growing the state’s cash reserve, Linehan said. She said she feels Nebraska’s revenue forecasts are usually too conservative.
Will expressed confidence that raising the revenue transfers into EFF would be manageable. He said lawmakers have multiple years to figure this out and noted there are many outside factors that impact state revenues.
He further argued that on average, Nebraska’s tax receipts grow about 4.5% each year, although that hasn’t been the case so far in 2025.
“I don’t want to say that $100-$125 million isn’t a problem we [have] got to solve, but it’s definitely not our biggest one,” Will said.
Education officials, however, remain on edge. Royers, of the NSEA, said if lawmakers pull back on EFF aid, that would hardly be the first time that state officials have made lofty promises to schools they later rescinded.
Linehan pushed back on the lack of trust school officials have with the state. While in the Legislature, she said it was frustrating to hear school representatives say they don’t trust her or other lawmakers when they consistently increased education funding, including through EFF itself.
It’s worth noting, however, that there have been two years over the past decade that aggregate state funding to school districts has dropped, according to Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent. However, the total amount of state aid to schools has continued its upward trajectory after those blips.
Trust issues aside, most people tend to agree that the biggest obstacle facing the fund is finding new revenues to support it. That is a challenge that will take time to overcome.
“The writing is on the wall if they don’t come up with new ways of raising income,” Koch said.

Autocrats have historically used fear of violent crime to grow and consolidate their power, writes constitutional scholar David Adler.
The post Trump’s takeover of D.C. police force unleashes new legal and constitutional concerns appeared first on WyoFile .","To justify his deployment of the National Guard to the streets of Washington, D.C., in conjunction with FBI, Border Patrol, Secret Service, ICE and DEA agents, as part of his federal takeover of the city’s police force, President Donald Trump has declared a “crime emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration comes despite the fact that federal officials in his own administration recently announced that violent crime in the District of Columbia has hit a 30-year low. 

Opinion

In an Aug. 11 press conference, Trump announced that these forces “can do whatever the hell they want” to curb crime, an unprecedented presidential action, and another assertion of his belief that he enjoys absolute power under Article II of the Constitution.
Trump has invoked a provision of the 1973 Washington D.C. Home Rule Act, which permits the president to take control of the city’s police force for a temporary period, up to 30 days. After that period, Trump must receive authorization from Congress if he wishes to maintain control of law enforcement. Trump’s false pretext for deploying the guardsmen, one exposed by his administration’s report that violent crime in the nation’s capital is down 35% from 2023, and has fallen to its lowest point since before the pandemic, is the latest in a string of troop deployments for domestic purposes. 
Just two months ago, he sent 4,000 national guardsmen and 800 active-duty Marines to quell protests in Los Angeles over his immigration policies, despite the fact that the protests, which were overwhelmingly peaceful and efficiently handled by local law enforcement, had largely ended. Trump’s actions appear to have violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which sharply limits use of the military in domestic law enforcement, as well as the 10th Amendment, and are the subject of a federal trial underway this week.
Trump’s executive takeover of law enforcement in the nation’s capital — long a goal of his — is predicated on his baseless description of the city as an urban hellscape and reflects his authoritarian trajectory. Devoid of a factually based rationale, since there is no street crime epidemic in the District, the legality of Trump’s action is specious and raises questions about his motives. Historically, autocrats have painted wildly exaggerated portraits of violent crime in cities before taking control of local law enforcement, pursuant to national expansion.
Indeed, Trump announced that he may also deploy the National Guard to other cities, naming New York, Chicago, Baltimore and Oakland, among others. Each city is governed by a Democratic mayor and located within a “Blue State.” FBI statistics indicate that crime is down, however, in New York and Baltimore, and the National Mayors Association has confirmed the reduction of crimes in cities across America. Historically speaking, authoritarian leaders have deployed the military into civilian populations as projections of power and presence, aiming to intimidate local populations and suppress dissent. The infliction of fear among the people has been a common technique among autocrats in other nations and across the decades, as a means of cowing opponents, silencing dissidents and preventing protests. Residents of Washington have already expressed fear at the sight of military boots in their streets.  
While it is likely that the deployment of forces in the nation’s capital also represents an additional effort to divert the attention of Trump’s MAGA base, outraged by the president’s failure to deliver on his promise to release the Epstein Files — a political and moral scandal that has engulfed his administration’s time, resources and energies, and which seemingly defies resolution — the broader legal and constitutional concerns arising across our nation ask about state authority, in the event of forthcoming deployments, to respond to presidential acts that swallow up the 10th Amendment. Mindful of the fact that all governmental acts, including those of presidents, must be tethered to the Constitution, citizens are right to ask about measures to restrain the federal government and prevent, as former Chief Justice Marshall wrote, transgression of legal boundaries. 
As is often the case, history offers valuable insights for our time. In 1798, when Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts. Founders, including James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, wrote resolutions — the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions — that decried violations of the Constitution which they believed constituted a fundamental threat to the republic, federalism and American liberties. We turn next week to their response.

In an era when infrastructure backlogs are long and government funding is thin, a public-private partnership in Converse County gets a job across the finish line.
The post Ayres Natural Bridge Park gets makeover thanks to unconventional approach appeared first on WyoFile .","Scrubby plains and strafing winds dominate the landscape of central Wyoming. But from an Interstate 25 exit west of Douglas, a narrow road leads down a lush canyon where a natural stone bridge spans a serene creek. 
“It is a gorgeous park,” said Ayres Natural Bridge Park caretaker Christy Smith. “It is very, very tranquil.”
With red rock walls hugging a green expanse of lawns, campsites and leafy trees, the park attracts local visitors as well as tourists who marvel at Ayres Bridge — one of only three natural stone bridges in the U.S. that spans running water. But in recent years, the park facilities were showing their age, said Smith, who lives in the park and manages it with her husband, Traves. 
Cracks and rust appeared on decades-old playground equipment, and picnic tables weren’t up to Americans with Disabilities Act standards. The sprinkler system was ancient and the grills were run down. The Smiths started looking around for funding to help bring the park up to date, but funding isn’t easy to come by, Smith said. Grants are hard to get for established parks, she said, and the county has its own budget constraints. 
“And then I get this email,” Smith said. 
The missive proposed a grant to fund the park rehabilitation project. Smith was incredulous, she said. “At first I thought it was a scam.”
It wasn’t a scam. The author of the email was Lori McCullough, founder and CEO of the Great Outdoors Fund. The national organization is dedicated to expanding access to the outdoors and improving recreation opportunities through public-private partnerships. And she had zeroed in on the Ayres Natural Bridge Park as a candidate. 
Fast forward to June, and crews with project sponsor Occidental Petroleum, or Oxy, as well as Converse County commissioners and others spent two days pouring cement, installing playground equipment, replacing grills and building a new fire pit. 
The project has substantially improved the park, Smith said.

It also sets out a model for alternative funding for outdoor recreation infrastructure and access in an era when government resources are challenged, inconsistent or in flux. 
“As these other funding sources become in jeopardy, it just makes more sense” to look to alternative ways to fund the projects, McCullough said. Across America, she added, “the need makes for limitless opportunities.”
Creative solutions
Wyoming’s outdoor recreation crowds have been growing for decades, and the COVID-19 pandemic fueled the trend when it fueled new interest in getting outside. 
Federal land management agencies like the U.S. Forest Service have been unable to keep staffing levels up even as maintenance and infrastructure backlogs have grown. Federal job layoffs and funding cuts in 2025 further limited their bandwidth, and nonprofits have attempted to fill the gaps with measures like hiring personnel to assist forest crews. 
The model used for the Ayres Natural Bridge Park project is another untraditional strategy. 
McCullough’s Great Outdoors Fund acts as a facilitator between private donors and outdoor projects that need resources. The end goal is to make the outdoors accessible to all, she said. Oxy, an energy company that has a significant presence in Converse County, went to her looking to fund a project in its target area, she said.
When she started researching potentials, she discovered the Ayres Natural Bridge Park. “And it just so happened that the county had decided on a significant investment in the irrigation system … and they didn’t have funding for any other upgrades,” McCullough said. 
She got in touch with the county, and soon after, sent the email that Smith suspected was spam. Agreements were drawn up, and with Oxy’s donation, the Great Outdoors Fund provided more than $100,000 for concrete pads, picnic tables, grills, a new four-way teeter-totter and a playground set, among other things.

Over two days in June, work crews and volunteers gathered in the park to complete the project.
The county is “thrilled” to be a beneficiary of the project, Commissioner Robert Short said, “because we want everyone to have the opportunity to enjoy this park.”
Along with addressing backlogs, Short said, he sees the project as an example of industrial development folks giving back to the communities where they work. 
Benefits
“It has completely changed the look of that area, and we are so happy with it,” Smith said. 
Smith has spent time in Ayres her entire life; her grandparents ran the park when she was a child. When she and Traves became caretakers four years ago, their priority was improving it for users, she said. This project took care of a lot of that work.

The benefits of natural spaces like Ayres Natural Bridge Park are immeasurable, McCullough said. “We can calculate the economic impact of recreation, but the impact on our health and well-being is incalculable,” she said. 
The county has plans to continue Ayres improvements. Phase two will entail redoing the walking path that encircles the park.

(Stills Congressional Campaign photo)The number of Democrats hoping to represent the party in the 2026 race for Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District has grown to three, all from Racine County and all positioning themselves as working-class candidates who contrast sharply with the incumbent.
Gage Stills, a 25-year-old community activist, said he comes to the race with “a strong working-class perspective on things, and I know what a lot of these families are going through — I’ve lived it.”
Stills said Friday that he launched his campaign in mid-July, running “under the radar” without a mass media announcement but with a campaign website and a Tik-Tok account to which he posts videos once a week.
That made him the second entry into the Democratic field for the 1st District, following Randy Bryce, who ran and lost in 2018 and announced May 20 he would try again. A third Democrat, nurse Mitchell Berman, entered the race August 12.
Each of the three are seeking the Democratic nomination to run against U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville), the incumbent now in his fourth term.
In an interview, Stills described his upbringing as one of a family “living paycheck to paycheck and not entirely certain where the next meal is going to come from.”
Even in those circumstances, however, he added, “My parents, they took good care of me and they raised me right and they raised me to care about the world and care about people.”
Stills said that “a big factor” in his decision to run was “the One Big Beautiful Bill and how much it does to hurt the working class and how much it does to hurt folks who are in the lower middle class.”
The “One Big, Beautiful Bill” is what Trump and the legislation’s GOP backers dubbed the mega-bill that extended tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term in 2017. The legislation, which Trump signed on July 4, also made significant cuts to Medicaid and federal food assistance and rolled back clean energy tax breaks that Congress and then-President Joe Biden enacted in 2022, among a number of other provisions.
Stills said Trump’s policies that ramped up the deployment of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers with arrests that have swept up immigrants, a number of whom were legally authorized to be in the U.S., were an additional factor in his decision.
“I have a lot of family who are Hispanic,” Stills said. “Some of my family members have married immigrants, and they came here legally, but you know, that’s not entirely guaranteed protection these days.”
He said his upbringing led him to believe “that it doesn’t make sense to complain if I’m not going to get in there and try to do the work.”
Stills said he as a cybersecurity analyst after working for about five months as a state corrections officer and before that in retail sales. He said he was active in Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Racine in 2020 and has volunteered with local environmental organizations and at a community homeless shelter.
The race for Congress is his first time running for a political office. While he acknowledged some voters might be wary, he said that he has “no political ties to anybody. I don’t owe anything to any corporation” — making him a fresh face that voters would appreciate.
“I think for too long we’ve seen politicians that, sure they’ve held political office, but they don’t use that office to help the people,” Stills said.
Steil is a corporate lawyer who previously worked as an aide to former U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Janesville Republican who represented the 1st District for 20 years after he was first elected in 1998.
Steil won his first term in 2018, defeating Bryce by a 12-point margin, and won subsequent races with a similar spread.
Stills said he believes he can overcome that gap. “I plan on speaking to the people’s needs,” he said.
While he didn’t attend a listening session that Steil held July 31 at which many constituents directed angry comments to the congressman, Stills said he followed news accounts of the event.
The people who attended “raised valuable concerns that it seemed that he just tried to brush off, or blame on Biden, which doesn’t work anymore,” Stills said.
“We know the votes that he’s casting,” he said of Steil. “We know that they’re not for us. And I think that the people are waking up to that.”
Stills said he wants to aim his message to people all across the political spectrum — left, center and right alike.
“I think that more and more people are going to look for an alternative,” he said. “I think that alternative should be a voice that speaks for them, that comes from the same place as them, a working class perspective.”

Holy Name Housing Corp. next will add on-site touches such as shingles, basement finishings and possibly a garage to the bungalow also designed by students at Metropolitan Community College.
If all goes as planned, the four-bedroom residence will be sold to a family for under $275,000, a homeownership opportunity in a high-rental pocket of one of the state’s more distressed areas.
Belying its swift, pop-up entrance — a captivating spectacle for onlookers — the house at 2452 Camden Ave. is the result of a lengthy and multi-organization process also involving an ‘at risk’ state housing fund intended to help ease Nebraska’s affordable housing shortage.
 Housing for middle income workforce  

Matthew Cavanaugh is executive director of Holy Name Housing, a grant recipient of the state’s Middle Income Workforce Housing Investment Fund, which since its 2020 creation by the Legislature has distributed about $42 million to help multiple nonprofits develop houses in qualified older and urban neighborhoods of the state’s three largest counties.

The fund for Douglas, Sarpy and Lancaster Counties is competitive. Holy Name over the years has been awarded a total of about $7 million, for which its private donors provide a partial match. The agency used recent grant funds to boost a revolving loan program that helps build homes such as the one that popped up in Miller Park. 
A relatively new partnership with Metro offers a different twist: Holy Name pays for building and materials while the students prepare architectural plans and housing components.
Holy Name covered the cost to transport the Camden Avenue house in sections from the college’s Fort Omaha campus a half-dozen blocks to the neighborhood. The bungalow was the second house produced via the partnership.
The idea is that repayment of loans into the nonprofit’s revolving fund will multiply the number of houses available for sale at relatively affordable prices. The targeted population of working-class homeowners is expected to help build stability and mixed-income neighborhoods. That ideally would lead to more jobs and economic prosperity in historically disinvested areas.
An even quicker benefit of the Metro partnership, said Cavanaugh, is hands-on training and enthusiasm-building provided to budding workers in construction trades — an understaffed industry he said is a key reason for high housing costs.
  The house is part of Holy Name’s effort to expand homeownership opportunities and help stabilize qualified urban neighborhoods. (Courtesy of MCC)
“They’ll be able to see the finished product, the contribution they made in a home that will be there for the next generations,” he said. “So hopefully it inspires students to continue to work in the trades … that’s what we’re excited about.”
The Middle Income Workforce housing fund has no income restrictions for homebuyers, but the Holy Name team says it screens applicants to weed out investors seeking to rent the property. Rules limit construction costs per house to no more than $330,000. A law change this year allows the grant funds to also be used to construct or renovate rent-to-own housing in qualified urban areas.
 ‘It’s all at risk’ 

Continued state funding for the program has been in jeopardy in recent years.
With the state budget facing major shortfalls, the Appropriations Committee sought to cut $4 million from each of the Middle Income and the separate Rural Workforce housing funds.
Instead, the Legislature approved a one-time $8 million transfer from the state’s longest-running housing program, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to help with budget woes. Unlike the two newer funds, that pot is fueled by a portion of the documentary stamp tax from real estate transactions.
“It’s all at risk,” Carol Bodeen, director of policy and outreach for the Nebraska Housing Developers Association, said of state funding for housing programs.

She said the last time the Legislature and governor committed new money for the housing funds was in 2022. Last year, the Legislature shifted $25 million from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to put in the two workforce funds. 
State lawmakers have named affordable housing a priority, but less than a month ago the Legislature’s fiscal office confirmed Nebraska’s current two-year budget was back into a projected deficit of about $95 million.
Meanwhile, housing advocates hope philanthropy and other innovative housing programs will help fill gaps.
 ‘A win-win’ 

The Craftsman-style bungalow on Camden Avenue was the second house Metro has worked on with Holy Name, but the college’s students previously completed four similar residential projects.
Metro said 170 students were involved over the past year in creating the bungalow. The cross-section of students represented architecture, electrical, plumbing, building and construction science programs. Built in four modules, the house features a welcoming foyer with custom-built cabinets, a kitchen pantry and an open floor plan.
“Beyond the education and skills that they developed over the past year finishing the home, it’s a tangible place that can always be a source of pride for our students long after they complete their degrees at MCC,” said Andrew Henrichs, the faculty member who led the project.

Cavanaugh hopes for a continued partnership with Metro as Holy Name continues its focus on building up neighborhoods near the Fort Omaha campus.
He said Holy Name, which acts as developer and general contractor, is enthused to have fresh and creative student ideas complementing the agency’s other affordable housing models. 
“It’s a win-win,” said Cavanaugh. “It’s awesome to give students that opportunity — and we get to see a new style of house designed by their architecture program.”

Mike Flood, R-Neb., touted the news as “a message that they’re focused on strengthening the NWS for years to come.”","Nebraska U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb., during his town hall in Lincoln on Aug 4. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner) LINCOLN – The National Weather Service announced this month that it would hire back 450 meteorologists, hydrologists, and radar technicians after making sweeping cuts earlier in the year. 
The announcement came as the agency tries to recoup losses from the Department of Government Efficiency’s effort to reshape the federal bureaucracy. While the Weather Service faced staffing issues long before President Donald Trump’s second term, recent cuts required “urgent action,” according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
Nebraska U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., touted the news as “a message that they’re focused on strengthening the NWS for years to come.”
“For decades, the National Weather Service has helped keep our communities safe with accurate and timely forecasts,” Flood said in a statement.

Flood led the push among Nebraska’s federal delegation to reverse a DOGE cut that caused a Weather Service office in the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices to pause the deployment of weather balloons in April. The station is launching two weather balloons a day, Flood has said, but the Omaha-area Weather Service office has said it still faces staffing issues. 
Retiring U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., also sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing his concerns about the NWS cuts. The Trump administration fired roughly a combined  600 workers from both agencies earlier this year. The cuts contributed to two forecasting offices that cover some rural parts of western and southwestern Nebraska to no longer monitor local weather around-the-clock, which Nebraska and local rural weather experts said threatens public safety.
Flood has introduced bipartisan-backed legislation that would make it harder for National Weather Service employees to be fired in the future. 
“It doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat or an Independent,” Flood said in June. “Everybody wants accurate weather forecasting.”

Bill Lee confirmed the state will not require the Boring Company to pay for land it uses to build a series of tunnels under Nashville to the airport and other destinations.
Lee said recently final negotiations for the state’s inspection process for Boring haven’t been finalized, but he doesn’t expect the company to be required to pay for use of state property to construct tunnels. A business dubbed the “Music City Loop” is planning to use electric vehicles to ferry riders from downtown Nashville to a series of stations and the airport.
“The Boring Company’s going to do this at no cost to the state,” Lee said. “The state will give right of way for them at no cost to the Boring Company because of the enormous investment they’re making on the state’s behalf.”

The company hasn’t given an estimated cost for the project or said how much riders will be charged to use the electric vehicles.
Previously, state Sen. Becky Massey said the state would provide the right of way to Boring under state roads for tunnel construction through a long-term lease. Routes haven’t been finalized, and it’s unclear whether tunnels would go only under state routes or Metro Nashville streets as well.
The company started digging a test hole in a state-owned parking lot near the Capitol this week. Boring Company President Steve Davis previously projected the tunnel could be put into use within two years.
Facing myriad questions from skeptics of the project, as well as Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell’s office, Lee defended the proposal to reporters in a press conference, saying the Boring Company has a “history of tunnels,” mainly a Las Vegas “loop” where the company has moved 3 million passengers safely.
But the Las Vegas project has failed to live up to the projections made by Boring Company officials in 2019, when Las Vegas officials approved the project. Intended to stretch for more than 68 miles, the tunnel only runs 2.2 miles under the convention center and the company took one year to dig 1.7 miles. According to the Nevada Current, construction at that rate could take 40 years to complete the entire loop.
Nashville mayor’s office queries Boring Company about tunnel plan

Reports also show the company built tunnels without permits, dumped untreated water into storm drains and sewers and was fined $112,000 over workers’ complaints about severe burns and muck spills. Boring is contesting the violations. 
O’Connell’s office submitted about 70 questions to the Boring Company, and Lee said he believes it is answering them. The questions deal with everything from emergency responses in the proposed tunnel to maintenance, ownership and safety standards.
Lee called Boring “a highly sophisticated company” that will be required to meet safety standards to ensure the tunnel is structurally sound for transportation.
“It’s incredibly important that we do it right,” Lee said. “But it’s also an incredible opportunity for our state to have a modern, state-of-the-art transit system that will move millions of people in our city and particularly in our state, entirely at no cost to the taxpayers.”
Tennessee Democratic leaders have criticized Lee for giving the right of way to the Boring Company for a private enterprise. The company is owned by Elon Musk, the world’s richest person.

(Kevin Hardy | Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Hery McMaster leads a briefing at the South Carolina Emergency Operations Center in West Columbia on Friday, Sept. 27, 2024, after the damage caused by Tropical Storm Helene. (Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Gov. Henry McMaster authorized deploying 200 National Guard members from South Carolina to Washington to support the Trump administration’s policing of the nation’s capital.
They leave Monday.
According to McMaster’s office, his order Saturday was requested by the Pentagon.
The troops are activated under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority, which means the federal government pays for their deployment but McMaster remains in control.
The governor said he will bring the troops back immediately if a hurricane or other natural disaster threatens the state.
“South Carolina is proud to stand with President Trump as he works to restore law and order to our nation’s capital and ensure safety for all who live, work, and visit there,” McMaster said in a statement.
The National Guard in South Carolina includes more than 9,300 Army National Guard and 1,300 Air National Guard members.
President Donald Trump asserted control of the Washington police force Aug. 11 and mobilized 800 National Guard troops after declaring a “crime emergency.”
It marked the first federal takeover since 1973, when the Home Rule Act allowed the city’s residents to elect their own mayor and city council. The law allows the president to take control when “special conditions of an emergency nature exist.” But it limits a takeover to 30 days, unless Congress passes a resolution extending the authority.
District officials sued Friday, arguing the Trump administration “far exceeded” its authority with an executive order making the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration the emergency police commissioner. In response, the Trump administration agreed to leave Washington’s police chief in charge of the city’s 3,400 officers.
But the lawsuit did not challenge Trump’s ability to deploy 800 National Guard members. Since the district is not a state, the president has sole authority over National Guard units in the capital city.
State Democratic Party Chair Christale Spain called it reckless for McMaster to send 200 troops to Washington in the middle of hurricane season.
“The gall of Henry to think so little of our friends, neighbors and loved ones as to send our heroes away during the very time they are most needed here at home is a disgusting act of betrayal,” she said in a statement Sunday.
“South Carolinians know all too well how devastating a storm can be,” she continued. “Instead of putting South Carolina first, Governor McMaster has chosen political loyalty to Donald Trump over the safety and security of the people he was elected to serve.”
State Rep. John King also questioned the deployment and its costs.
“We are told federal reimbursement will cover the expenses, but history has shown there are always hidden costs that fall back on taxpayers,” the Rock Hill Democrat wrote Sunday in a letter to McMaster also sent out in a news release.
He called the deployment “political theater.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mcmaster-briefing-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

Fueled by hot summer weather and persistent drought conditions across the western half of the state, wildfires as of Aug. 18 had burned more than 200,000 acres in Colorado in 2025.
It’s Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020, when multiple historic blazes burned a record-setting 625,357 acres, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.
Drought conditions classified as “severe” or “extreme” extend across the majority of the Western Slope, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. A critical fire weather advisory for western Colorado and several neighboring states has been issued by the Rocky Mountain Area Coordination Center, a Denver-based branch of the NIFC, and will remain in place through at least mid-August.

“After a dry winter with minimal snowpack fuel moistures are well below normal, and much of the region is under severe to extreme drought,” the agency warns. “Extreme fire behavior marked by rapid spread, torching, and resistance to control is being driven by critically dry … fuels, and drought-stressed brush and trees. As heat intensifies and fuel moistures decline further, fire potential will remain elevated across the area.”
Here is a look at three 2025 Colorado fires:

The Lee Fire, west of the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County, has burned an estimated 137,485 acres with 61% containment as of Aug. 18. It was caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The nearby Elk Fire, southeast of Meeker, was also caused by lightning on Aug. 2. It has burned an estimated 14,518 acres as of Aug. 18, and is 100% contained.
The Turner Gulch Fire, east of Gateway near the Colorado-Utah border in Mesa County, is 79% contained and has burned an estimated 31,697 acres since it was started by lightning on July 12.

Due to climate change, much of Colorado has grown hotter and drier in recent decades, increasing wildfire risk. The three largest wildfires in Colorado history all occurred in 2020, and the state’s 20 biggest fires on record have all occurred in the past 20 years. Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of the Western Slope to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, and the region’s current “megadrought” is its worst dry spell in at least 1,200 years.
Most wildfires are caused by human activity. To minimize the risk of sparking a fire, authorities urge visitors to national forests and other public lands to follow local fire restrictions, ensure that vehicles are properly maintained and trailer chains are secured, and avoid driving or parking on dry grass.
In 2017, the State Forest Service reported that more than 2.9 million Coloradans lived in the “wildland-urban interface” — areas at risk of being impacted by wildfires. Fire safety experts urge residents of such zones to familiarize themselves with the “Ready, Set, Go” system of precautions.

Human emissions driving Colorado River ‘megadrought,’ CU Boulder research finds


By: Chase Woodruff - Monday August 18, 2025 4:00 am





As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature,  concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
A 2022 study attributed about 40% of the megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but Pedro DiNezio, an associate professor at CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, said the new paper “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” said DiNezio. “Both contribute to drought.”

Polis declares emergency over ‘near record level’ Colorado fire danger


By: Chase Woodruff - Friday August 15, 2025 9:23 am





Colorado Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday issued a broad emergency declaration covering multiple wildfires currently burning on the Western Slope and the risk of new fires as dangerous weather conditions persist in the coming weeks.
More than 2,000 local, state and federal personnel are currently battling nine large fires in Colorado, including the Lee Fire in Rio Blanco County, which as of Friday ranked as the fifth-largest fire in state history at an estimated size of 133,602 acres. Polis said in a press release that Thursday’s executive order declaring an emergency would “bolster our ability to jump on fires early” as elevated fire risk continues.
“Continuing throughout July and into August, and as part of the same prolonged weather pattern, parts of Colorado have experienced continued high temperatures, high winds, severe to extreme drought conditions, and near record level fire indices,” the order says. “Elevated fire weather and fire risk is forecast for the coming weeks.”

Containment of the Lee Fire west of Meeker has dropped slightly to 6%, compared to its 7% containment Monday. A Tuesday morning map of the fire, which is the fifth-largest in state history, showed 116,859 acres burned. That’s more than 3,000 new acres burned since Monday.
The Lee Fire started in Rio Blanco County and has spread toward Rifle in Garfield County, pushed by strong winds and dry conditions.
During a community meeting at Colorado Mountain College on Monday night, incident meteorologist Rose Schoenfeld said smoke conditions are expected to improve in Rifle throughout Tuesday as winds change. But fire crews still face challenges ahead, especially moving into Wednesday, Schoenfeld added.
“Wednesday is really the day to watch with regards to fire weather,” Schoenfeld said. “Wednesday is going to be warmer, and it’s going to be more of an unstable atmosphere.”
“In the past 30 days, we have gotten 5% of the normal precipitation, putting the area in extreme drought,” she added.

The Lee Fire near the town of Meeker in Rio Blanco County has grown to be the fifth-largest wildfire in state history as crews continued to battle fires in several parts of Colorado on Monday.
Dry weather and strong winds have pushed the Lee Fire south toward Garfield County, blazing through more than 113,000 acres. It was at 7% containment as of Monday. The fire was believed to have been caused by lightning on Aug. 2.
The state’s newest wildfire, the Oak Fire, sparked Sunday west of Pagosa Springs in Archuleta County. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuations in Elk Park and pre-evacuation orders in other nearby areas.

Western Slope wildfires already add up to Colorado’s worst fire year since 2020


By: Chase Woodruff - Wednesday August 6, 2025 2:23 pm





High winds and extreme drought conditions in northwest Colorado have fueled the rapid growth of two wildfires this week near Meeker in Rio Blanco County, where firefighting crews say they’re prioritizing structure protection with “limited resources” on hand.
The Lee Fire, west of Meeker, nearly doubled in size Tuesday and has now burned 22,497 acres, predominantly on Bureau of Land Management land south of Colorado Highway 13. About 20 miles to the east, the Elk Fire is estimated at 8,304 acres in size. Both fires are believed to have been started by lightning strikes on Aug. 2.
With the latest growth, the estimated area burned in Colorado by 11 major wildfires in 2025 now stands at 64,196 acres, according to federal data. That doesn’t include smaller fires suppressed by state and local first responders, but it already makes for the state’s worst fire year since 2020.

The commission has received 39 applicants for the three open positions. The next commissioners will be selected by a consensus vote of the governor, Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader.
39 apply to serve on North Dakota Ethics Commission

Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Senate Majority Leader David Hogue are among those who have openly disagreed with the commission about the scope of its authority and some of its practices.
“I don’t think it’s a secret that I have some questions I would like answered about the role and guardrails,” Armstrong said during a Friday meeting of selection committee members.
Hogue said he also wants to know how candidates would handle so-called frivolous complaints. Some lawmakers during the legislative session said that people were weaponizing the Ethics Commission by filing baseless complaints against their political opponents.
“I’m not willing to support anybody who is not willing to dispose of non-serious complaints in short order,” Hogue said.
Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, suggested that the committee ask candidates if there are any broad structural changes they would like to see the commission make.

She also suggested that the selection committee ensure candidates can articulate the basic purpose and responsibilities of the commission, which she said many people misunderstand.
The selection committee said it would prepare a list of questions to send to applicants by the end of this week. After that, they would select a smaller group of candidates for the first round of interviews.
One winning applicant will finish out the term of former chair Dave Anderson, who died unexpectedly in May. That term ends in 2026.
Another will replace Commissioner Ward Koeser, whose term wraps up Aug. 31.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen’s term also ends on Aug. 31, though he is seeking to be reappointed. Sagvseen joined the commission to fill the seat left by former Ethics Commission Chair Paul Richard, who retired last year. The commission sent a letter to the Governor’s Office supporting his reappointment.
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.
Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel.

Yes, the state’s economy slowed last year along with the nation. But Michigan hit some important positive milestones that threaten to be undone by President Donald Trump’s economic wrecking ball.
The number of people in the state’s labor force—nearly 5.1 million—was the highest in 23 years. And the labor force participation rate—the percentage of working-age adults employed or looking for work—returned to pre-COVID levels.
Michigan also recorded the largest number of payroll jobs in 20 years, averaging 4.5 million positions last year.
Most important, incomes rose as inflation softened and the state produced more high-wage jobs. Last year was the first year since 2020 that the average Michigan worker saw a gain in real earnings. Just 14% of jobs in the state paid $15 an hour or less, down from more than 22% in 2022.
Those numbers come from the Michigan Center for Data and Analytics, a state agency that doesn’t hesitate to publish unflattering economic data about Michigan’s economic performance.
Its annual report highlights a number of areas, including the unemployment and labor force participation rates, where Michigan lags competitor states. And the report, released in April, noted the state’s economy, while still growing, was continuing to slow in the early months of this year.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But Trump’s chaotic implementation of tariffs and other moves by the administration could throw the state’s economy into reverse.
Detroit’s automakers have been some of the hardest-hit U.S. corporations as Trump has slapped big tariffs on almost every country in the world in an attempt to end trade deficits with the U.S. He’s tariffed countries such as Brazil and Canada where the U.S. has trade surpluses.
Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have collectively paid $2.1 billion in tariffs so far this year and expect to pay billions more by the end of 2025. They’ve largely eaten the tariffs, but analysts say they will soon have to pass a hefty chunk of those costs to consumers.
The tariffs’ hit on automakers and other employers has alarmed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who scored a recent private meeting with Trump to discuss how the levies were hurting the Detroit Three and the state’s economy. The outcome of that meeting wasn’t disclosed, but it seems unlikely Trump will back away from what he sees as the centerpiece of his economic blueprint.
Ironically, tariffs might give some foreign automakers an advantage over the Detroit Three.
Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley has complained that the 15% tariff Trump slapped on imported Japanese cars is less than the 25% tariff Detroit automakers pay on some of the vehicles and parts they import from Canada and Mexico. Trump had earlier assessed a 25% tariff on Japanese-built vehicles but lowered it as part of a broader trade agreement.
Farley told Bloomberg TV that the new tariff, combined with Japan’s lower labor and currency costs could make a Japan-built Toyota 4Runner $10,000 cheaper than a Michigan-built Ford Bronco.
Trump’s deal with Japan outraged the United Auto Workers union, which said it “hands a win to transnational automakers that rely on low-road labor practices, substandard wages, excessive (temporary workers), and union-busting.”
UAW President Shawn Fain was an early supporter of Trump’s tariff strategy, but the duties could prove costly to his members’ pocketbooks. Analysts say tariff-induced losses at the Detroit Three could cut thousands of dollars from autoworkers’ profit-sharing checks this year.
It almost seems as if Trump is rooting against the home team with his trade war.
And it’s not just automakers and large corporations that are reeling from the tariffs. Small businesses in the state are being hit as well by the levies and an overall uncertainty caused by the president’s economic policies.
A June survey of 644 small-and-medium-sized businesses, conducted by the Lansing-based Michigan Business Network, found those business owners in a gloomy mood because of tariffs, inflation and other issues.
Expectations of increases in profits, sales and investments were at their lowest points in the 16-year history of the semiannual survey, MBN founder and CEO Chris Holman said.
“We have never seen less enthusiasm by business owners for expecting increases in their revenue or profits this year because of tariffs and inflation,” Holman told Detroit Free Press business columnist and “Michigan Matters” television show host Carol Cain.
Trump, you may recall, promised to lower prices “on day one” of his administration. But inflation has remained stubbornly high.
Fewer than half of business owners surveyed said they were optimistic about how Trump’s election would favor their businesses. That’s down from 60% who were enthused about his election six months ago.
Trump has warned his sweeping economic overhaul will create a painful transition period on the way to a revitalized domestic auto industry and a “golden age of America.”
Michigan businesses and workers are feeling the pain. But they’re not so sure it’s going to subside any time soon.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gettyimages-2208184612_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 06:56:43.885740

John Hoffman, his wife, Yvette, and their daughter Hope, shocked the nation.



“This isn’t just a murder case,” Acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson told the Associated Press in July after a court hearing for 58-year-old Vance Boelter who was charged with the killing, “This is a political assassination.”





Beyond the headlines, Boelter may have a singular place in the history of bombings, arsons and assassinations that have marked the era of legal abortion in the United States: He is (allegedly) the first to kill a public official.
When Boelter was indicted on federal charges (to which he has pleaded not guilty), The New York Times reported, “Nothing revealed by the prosecutors suggests that the shooter was motivated by religious fervor.” The Times offered no other motive, but Boelter’s past, and his own words, point to a likely religious motive — like those of every other anti-abortion assassin.
The rest of us needn’t turn a blind eye to the obvious. In fact, the preservation of democracy in our time requires that we don’t.
Available evidence suggests that Boelter was thwarted early in a campaign he had been planning for as much as two years — to assassinate pro-choice Democratic elected officials, abortion providers and abortion rights advocates. No other professions or viewpoints have surfaced from among the 45-70 names reported in various media to have been found in his car and in other of his writings.
In addition to Hortman and Hoffman, the list includes other Minnesota state and federal legislators as well as U.S. Representatives from Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Texas and Wisconsin. It also included Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan and Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with former Minnesota State Rep. Ruth Richardson, now president of Planned Parenthood of the North Central States.
  In this handout provided by Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office, Vance Luther Boelter poses for a booking photo on June 16, 2025 in Green Isle, Minnesota.
Boelter was identified by police when he had to abandon his car at the murder scene. He was on the lam for several days before he was arrested near his home in Green Isle, a town of 556 in rural Sibley County.
Academy for the End Times
The key part of Boelter’s religious history is his attendance at Christ for the Nations Institute (CFNI) in Dallas, Texas, from 1988-1990. He graduated with a Diploma in Practical Theology in Leadership and Pastoral. The school, founded in 1970, is best known for training missionaries, and for its founder Gordon Lindsay who was part of the Pentecostal Latter Rain movement, which was inspired by William Branham in 1948 in Canada. Lindsay founded the ministry Voice of Healing that year to promote Branham’s work. As Kari Lardner reported in Religion Dispatches, they were also part of the British Israelism movement:


        According to this movement, White people were the true Israel of the Bible, a belief that was pivotal to the mid-century Latter Rain revival Lindsay helped organize … In fact, Branham had been ordained into ministry by the National Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and Lindsay had strong connections with white-supremacist networks throughout North America.    
 
Lindsay later distanced himself from Branham because of his violent antisemitic views, “though it’s unclear,” Lardner writes, “whether Lindsay ever actually recanted his views on British Israelism.” The Christian Identity movement in the U.S. informs some of the most violent white supremacist groups.
Lindsay’s post-Branham ministry became an early training school for the formation of apostolic networks — a feature of what came to be called the New Apostolic Reformation.
End Times war in the here and now
As I reported last year in Barn Raiser, the term New Apostolic Reformation (NAR) was coined in the 1990s by the late C. Peter Wagner, a professor at Fuller Theological Seminary. He and his colleagues had observed that Pentecostal and charismatic churches that operate outside of denominational structures, were the fastest growing sector of Christianity in the United States and worldwide. In this movement, Wagner saw a trend, an emerging new paradigm, that he and his close associates eventually sought to shape, organize and lead.
The NAR movement comprises loosely organized, often international networks of independent or nondenominational churches and ministries. NAR leaders believe that Christian institutions have mostly gotten it wrong for the last 2,000 years. They have sought to replace historically democratic church governance in Protestant churches with what they call “apostolic governance.” They are trying to do the same in government. To achieve this, they seek the restoration of modern-day apostles and prophets and the church of the first century, as they imagine it.
The NAR vision draws on beliefs and practices from earlier religious movements, such as Latter Rain, as well as Christian Reconstructionism, which emerged from Calvinism and helped shape the theocratic trend of the Christian Right in the 1980s and 1990s, and has become prominent in the persons of Idaho pastor Doug Wilson and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
The NAR is spearheading an increasingly politicized movement that seeks religious and political “dominion” in the U.S. and the world. In the view of Latter Rain/NAR, many existing churches, church offices and doctrines are obstacles to advancing of the kingdom of God on Earth. In a guest sermon when he was a missionary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Boelter’s prophecy that God will send apostles and prophets to correct the churches is consistent with this idea.
C. Peter Wagner called this obstacle the “spirit of religion.” Some apostolic leaders express this idea forcefully. Apostle Greg Hood of Franklin, Tennessee, for example, sells a T-shirt emblazoned with the quote: “We are here to put a knife to the throat of religion.”
These movements generally see themselves as part of an emerging global army engaged in an End Times war. The theater of this war is first a matter of “spiritual warfare” — organized collective prayer against demonic forces in heaven and on Earth. But important apostolic leaders warn that the theater of the war may expand — and become physical at any time.
This final force features the rise of what is variously called the “Manifest Sons of God” and “Joel’s Army” — an elite mobilization of Christians who will acquire supernatural powers and ultimately defeat Satanic forces. Accounts vary as to exactly how and when these things will unfold. But many believe it is already underway.
Heroes know which villains to kill
There’s a relationship between “spiritual warfare” and physical warfare. NAR leaders increasingly refer to Democrats, liberals, feminists and LGBTQ+ people — basically anyone with a different political, religious or gender identity — as demonic, and blame them for society’s problems. There are potential consequences for this kind of thinking.
“Social science since World War 2 and the Nazi genocide has shown that under specific conditions, virulent demonization and scapegoating can and does create milieus in which the potential for violence is increased,” Chip Berlet, a former longtime researcher with Political Research Associates, wrote in 2014. “What social science cannot do, is predict which individual upon hearing the rhetoric of clear or coded incitement will turn to violence.”
Berlet’s essay was titled “Heroes Know Which Villains to Kill: How Coded Rhetoric Incites Scripted Violence.” Indeed, villain identification has been going on for a long time, and NAR leaders have been increasingly featuring scripts for contemporary violence and religious war.
Prosecutors are so far saying Boelter acted alone. However, scholars report that those said to be “lone wolves” rarely, if ever, act entirely alone. Thus, it was intriguing when Boelter texted his family while he was on the lam: “Dad went to war last night … I don’t wanna say more because I don’t wanna implicate anybody.” Given that NAR leaders understand themselves to be in a war with secular government and other established institutions, it would not be surprising if it turns out that Boelter is not a lone vigilante warrior.
Boelter’s war
Boelter apparently kept his violent intentions to himself over the months, and perhaps as long as two years of planning his assassination campaign.
His friends have described him as religiously and politically conservative, but reserved about it.
He was less reserved while serving as a missionary in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 2021 and 2023, where he is known to have given three sermons at La Borne Matadi, a Pentecostal church in the Atlantic seaport city of Matadi, in which he expressed views consistent with NAR thought.
In one sermon Boelter preached:


        They don’t know abortion is wrong, many churches. They don’t have the gifts flowing. God gives the body gifts. To keep balance. Because when the body starts moving in the wrong direction, when they’re one, and accepting the gifts, God will raise an apostle or prophet to correct their course.    
 
When Boelter speaks here of the body, he is evidently referencing the Body of Christ, meaning the church. In the general Latter Rain/NAR view, the Body of Christ is being transformed into an End Times army, led by apostles and prophets. Boelter added:


        God is going to raise up apostles and prophets in America, to correct his church. … Many churches in America didn’t listen to Jesus. … They’re divided. This little group here, this little group here, this little group here. … And the enemy, the devil, comes through and rips everything apart. The churches are so messed up, they don’t know abortion is wrong, many churches.    
 
In another sermon, he tells the audience that “people don’t know what sex they are” because the devil “has gotten so far into their mind and their soul.”
The idea of God sending apostles and prophets to “correct his church” is significant because of the Latter Rain/NAR idea that traditional Christian denominations, doctrines, and officers are seen as obstacles to advancing the Kingdom of God as they see it.
Diversity, equity and inclusion
CFNI (Christ for the Nations Institute) has remained a key institution in the NAR movement. Dutch Sheets, a leading apostle, graduated from CFNI and later became its executive director. According to Matthew D. Taylor of the Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies, “No Christian leader did more to mobilize Christians to be in DC on January 6th than Dutch Sheets,” who Taylor says helped develop “strategic-level spiritual warfare programs to mobilize charismatic evangelicals to do spiritual warfare on Trump’s behalf.” Apostle Cindy Jacobs — who helped develop the NAR’s distinct style of intercessory prayer and was present at the Capitol on January 6 guiding the nation in prayer — teaches at the Institute where she received an award in 2025. That said, this doesn’t necessarily mean that everyone involved in CFNI believes exactly the same things. What’s more, like NAR itself, CFNI’s student body has always been multiracial, multiethnic and multinational, its roots in Latter Rain/British Israelism notwithstanding.
And in fairness, the institutions with which Boelter has been affiliated have denounced and distanced themselves from his alleged crimes. These include Christ for the Nations Institute, La Borne Matadi (the Congolese Pentecostal church where he gave several sermons) and Jordan Family Church in Jordan, Minnesota, a town of 5,000, 40-miles southwest of Minneapolis where he is a member. Since Boelter’s arrest, his church has removed its sermons from the web.
It is also important to note that while Boelter’s acts may not represent those organizations, nor of the broad conservative, anti-abortion wing of Christianity, they are definitely not representative of Christianity at large. In fact, mainstream polling consistently shows that many American Christians, including most Catholics, are pro-choice. What’s more, leading denominations of mainline Protestantism have been officially pro-choice since the 1970s. These include The Episcopal Church, United Church of Christ and Presbyterian Church (USA).
Nevertheless, the religious origins of Boelter’s alleged criminal, and arguably revolutionary, mission is clear, even as some tiptoe around it. This squeamishness is typical when Christianity of any kind informs the motives of violent criminal suspects. We can assume, however, that law enforcement, politicians and the media would have been far less demure if Boelter was a Muslim.
The past is prologue
There is precedent for an anti-abortion hit list that includes government officials. Two decades ago, a web site called the Nuremberg Files listed abortion providers alongside pro-choice celebrities, government officials from both parties and federal judges, including members of the U.S. Supreme Court.
It was named for the city where the German war crimes trials were held after World War II. Site proprietor, the late Neal Horsley explained, “A coalition of concerned citizens throughout the USA is cooperating in collecting dossiers on abortionists in anticipation that one day we may be able to hold them on trial for crimes against humanity.”
Originally, the Nuremberg Files listed only abortion providers, but the list grew to comprise several hundred others who were called “abortionists” because of their political support for reproductive rights or their efforts to enforce the law to protect women needing an abortion.
“Judges and politicians who pass or uphold laws authorizing child-killing or oppressing pro-life activists: These classes of individuals,” among others, Horsley declared, “are all committing various crimes to which they should answer. We regard them all as ‘abortionists.’ ”
The site was regarded as a hit list after he began crossing out the names of murdered doctors and clinic staff after their demise; and graying the names of those who were wounded.
Pointing to the crossed-out name Dr. Barnett Slepian on his computer screen in one scene in the 2001 HBO documentary “Soldiers in the Army of God,” Horsley recalled his reaction to the murder: “When I drew a line through his name, I said ‘See, I told ya. There’s another one. How many more is it gonna take?’ ”
“The evidence is at hand,” Horsley declares. “There are people out there who [will] go out and blow their brains out.”
As I reported for Salon at the time, Horsley was involved in the Army of God, the largely underground network in whose name antiabortion violence had been carried out since the early 1980s.
In an essay titled “Understanding the Army of God,” Horsley described the enemy as a culture and a country that have fallen away from God’s laws. He therefore saw the Army of God as holy warriors engaged in “terrorist actions” because “the government of the USA has become a godless and apostate body.” Therefore, he declared, “the people who rise up in arms against such idolatry deserve the name ‘The Army of God.’ ”
The Army of God splintered in the wake of a wave of arrests, prosecutions and a massive monetary judgement by a federal court against some of its leaders. Its website is currently under construction but promises to be back. One feature of the site is a list of people incarcerated for their anti-abortion crimes, called Prisoners of Christ. It would not be surprising to see Boelter added to the list when the site is relaunched.
In any case, the idea that the government has fallen away from God’s laws and needs to be overthrown, lives on. Boelter’s inclusion of elected officials on his hit list suggests that he shares Horsley’s view of the complicity of government and government officials in abortion and tolerance of homosexuality.
Like all other known anti-abortion assassins, Boelter’s Christianity informed his alleged crimes. Here are three of his predecessors.

James Kopp assassinated abortion provider Dr. Barnett Slepian at his home in Amherst New York in 1998. Slepian had just returned from his synagogue where he had said kaddish in remembrance of his father. Kopp was a member of the itinerant Catholic-led antiabortion group, Lambs of Christ. He is also a suspect in a series of shootings across Canada.
Paul Hill assassinated abortion provider Dr. John Britton in Pensacola, Florida in 1994. Hill was an ordained minister in the evangelical Presbyterian Church in America (later defrocked) and was a graduate of Reformed Theological Seminary in Jackson, Mississippi.
Scott Roeder assassinated abortion provider Dr. George Tiller while he served as an usher during Sunday service at his Lutheran church in Wichita, Kansas in 2009. Roeder had no known previous antiabortion involvements. However, at his sentencing he read aloud from a book by Paul Hill titled, “Why Shoot an Abortionist?”

What is different about Boelter is that while abortion providers were also on the hit list, like Neal Horsley, he targeted elected officials as well. This suggests that when he texted his family that “dad’s gone to war,” his war was not just with abortion care, but the system of government that allows and protects it. Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston, Sr., of FBI Minneapolis, correctly characterized Boelter’s alleged crimes “an attack on the rule of law.”
Others who have committed violence against abortion providers have held to revolutionary theocratic views of various sorts, but Boelter was allegedly the first to strike government officials. He may not be the last.

The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.

(John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is challenging the outcome of a vote in Mason that would enter the city into a detention facility contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The organization sent a letter to town officials Friday demanding that Mason leadership halt the contract’s execution.
The Town of Mason’s Board of Mayor and Aldermen approved a contract with private prison corporation CoreCivic to reopen the West Tennessee Detention Facility as an immigration detention center on Tuesday, voting 4-1 with two abstentions.
The town’s separate but related contract with ICE received three ayes, two nays, and two abstentions. 
Questions over the vote’s outcome surfaced immediately after the chaotic meeting concluded. Some officials reported that the vote was successful in approving the ICE contract, claiming the abstentions did not count toward the vote total and therefore the vote passed 3-2, a simple majority of the votes counted (but not the number of members present).
West Tenn. town approves CoreCivic to run immigration detention facility after chaotic meeting

But the ACLU says this is an error, according to the letter sent to the town’s mayor, recorder and an attorney who spoke on behalf of the municipality during Tuesday’s meeting. The organization stated that, according to the town’s charter, the vote should have been counted based on members present. Thus, it would need four votes out of seven total votes to pass.
“The Town of Mason Charter says any form of board action should be passed by a majority of members present if there is a quorum,” ACLU of Tennessee Policy Director Bryan Davidson said Friday. The charter also states that the board can determine its own rules, and has chosen to follow Robert’s Rules of Order.
Based on the charter, state law and Robert’s Rules, the ACLU said the contract was not approved.
“We do not believe that this contract passed, and therefore any action taken by the mayor and board of the Town of Mason to further the execution of this contract is illegal and it’s invalid,” Davidson said.
Mayor Eddie Noeman, City Recorder Lureatha Harris, and attorney Nathan Bicks could not be immediately reached for comment.
The ACLU also states that because the start date of the contract with CoreCivic is dependent on the start date of the ICE contract, the CoreCivic agreement is also void.
ACLU Tennessee Legal Director Stella Yarbrough requested a written response from town leadership within seven days of the letter’s receipt. The organization also included a request for all communication between the mayor and board members and representatives of both CoreCivic and ICE, beginning in November 2024 through present day.
“Zooming out from the procedural deficiencies, there’s a lot of questions here around the total lack of transparency in this process,” Davidson added.
The ICE contract, a 200-page document, was presented to board members as a physical copy immediately before the Tuesday vote, he said, and was not available for public review online until two days later.
The majority of people who spoke at Tuesday’s meeting opposed using the currently empty prison facility as an immigration detention center.
Eloise Thompson, whose family has roots in Mason and surrounding areas going back to the 1870s, was one of the residents to stand in opposition.
“We’re just absolutely not interested in a for-profit prison operation … at the expense of human suffering,” she said on a media call Friday. “Not only does it come down to the human suffering part, it really can eat at one’s soul to feel a part of something like that.”
The community in Mason is interested in economic growth, she said, but “moving forward in the right way and in the way that lifts those around us and lifts our community.”

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Election security or overkill?
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Courtesy photo)Advertisements promoting the abortion pill will be at gas stations across West Virginia and Kentucky over the next few weeks. 
Mayday Health, a New York-based health education nonprofit, will run the ads at 104 rural gas stations through Sept. 7. The campaign started Aug. 11. 
The advertisements say “Pregnant? Don’t want to be? Learn more at Mayday Health.”
Executive director Liv Raisner said it’s crucial to advertise at gas stations, which serve as community hubs in rural areas.
“Many rural counties in West Virginia and Kentucky have few or no OB-GYN providers. Some have lost their only hospitals, their only clinics,” Raisner said. “So routine education and preventative reproductive health information is much harder to access through traditional medical channels. And so that’s why we decided to advertise at gas stations.”
The organization started after the Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion in 2022.
“We heard this sobering statistic that only 10% of Americans even knew what abortion pills were,” Raisner said. “And with clinics closed, reproductive options became very limited for women across the United States. We knew that a massive education campaign needed to be executed to inform people that they still have options.”
According to the Guttmacher Institute, in 2023, medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions in the United States, up from 53% in 2020. 
In 2022, West Virginia lawmakers passed a law banning abortion with narrow exceptions. Earlier this summer, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ban in a challenge brought by abortion pill manufacturer GenBioPro. 
Despite abortion being illegal in West Virginia in most cases, Raisner said the organization does not fear legal repercussions from the campaign. 
“We don’t have concerns about advertising because we don’t sell, distribute or package abortion pills,” they said. “We’re merely spreading First Amendment-protected free speech. So if anyone wants to come after us, what they’re coming after is the First Amendment.”
Earlier this year, Mayday Health launched a digital billboard and poster campaign in Tennessee and an aerial campaign above the Indy 500.
While abortion is mostly illegal in West Virginia, states with abortion bans may have trouble prosecuting out-of-state providers and entities mailing pills to people within their borders.
Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe V. Wade, 22 states and Washington D.C. have enacted shield laws that protect patients, providers and people assisting in abortion from the reach of states where it’s illegal, according to KFF. Some shield laws protect providers who send abortion pills to people in states with abortion bans. 
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Senate passed a bill aimed at out-of-state providers that would have made it a felony to prescribe or distribute medications used for abortion to people in West Virginia unless the abortion is legal. The bill was not taken up by the House of Delegates. 
West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey recently signed on to a letter urging Congress to ban shield laws, calling them “blatant attempts to interfere with states’ ability to enforce criminal laws within their borders.”
“People in [states with abortion bans] should be and are empowered to make their own decisions,” Raisner said. 
The website directs people to sites where they can order abortion medication.
People who visit Mayday Health are also linked to a helpline where they can get free, private advice on state specific abortion laws, they said. The group encourages website visitors to reach out to a hotline where a group of doctors provide free advice. 
Raisner said it’s also important for people to know that abortion pills are safe and effective. 
“There’s so much misinformation peddled by the anti-choice movement about the dangers of abortion pills, and it’s just not true,” Raisner said. “Abortion pills are so safe that they are even sold over the counter in some foreign countries. 
“Clinics are closing across the country, but people everywhere still have the power to make the choices that are right for their reproductive health,” they said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)As historic drought conditions on the Western Slope fuel another dangerous wildfire season, a new paper from researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder warns that human-caused climate change is playing a major role in making those conditions worse.
Previously published climatological research has found that the Colorado River Basin’s current “megadrought” is the worst dry spell the region has experienced in at least 1,200 years. But a new study, published last week in the journal Nature,  concludes that those persistently dry conditions are being driven by human activity “more intensely — and more directly — than previously understood,” its authors say.
Jeremy Klavans and Pedro DiNezio of CU Boulder’s Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences worked with other scientists from around the country to model how global climate patterns affect rainfall across the U.S. southwest.

Their findings concern a climate pattern known as the Pacific decadal oscillation. Related to the better-known El Niño-La Niña cycle to the south, the PDO is a natural fluctuation that brings warm water to the northeastern Pacific Ocean near the U.S. West Coast during its “positive” phase, leading to more storms and higher-than-average rainfall. During its “negative” phase, however, cooler water and air temperatures result in less precipitation in Western states.
Despite typically reversing itself every one or two decades, the PDO has been “stuck” in the negative, dry phase since the 1990s. By analyzing more than 500 climate model simulations developed by climatologists around the world, the study’s authors were able to paint the clearest picture yet of the influence of human activity on the PDO, and the resulting Southwestern megadrought.
“All of them had this common signal when we averaged them together,” DiNezio said in an interview. “By having so many simulations, we could be absolutely sure that this was not an artifact of a single model, or of a subset of simulations.”
Severe drought conditions have persisted in the Colorado River Basin since 2000, putting increased stress on the water supplies relied on by about 40 million people in Colorado and six other Western states. Water levels in two key reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have fallen to record lows in recent years.










What's important here is that we're showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation ... Both contribute to drought.


– Pedro DiNezio, researcher with CU Boulder's Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences


Rising levels of greenhouse gases, mostly the result of fossil-fuel combustion, have caused much of western Colorado and neighboring states in the Colorado River’s Upper Basin to warm by an average of more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit above pre-industrial levels, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.
Prior research has attributed about 40% of the post-2000 megadrought to higher temperatures alone, as hotter weather leads to greater evaporation of moisture from water surfaces and soils. Modeling global warming’s precise impacts on rainfall patterns has proved more elusive, but DiNezio said the new research “add(s) more human influence to that previous number.”
“What’s important here is that we’re showing that rainfall has also been influenced by humans, in addition to just evaporation,” he said. “Both contribute to drought.”
Colorado and other states that are parties to the 103-year-old Colorado River Compact have negotiated for years over how to distribute the cuts to water use made necessary by the basin’s ongoing drought. The federal Bureau of Reclamation on Friday announced another year of reduced water allocations for the Lower Basin states of Arizona and Nevada.
Not long ago, the possibility that the Pacific decadal oscillation would eventually reverse itself offered hope that the long-term drought outlook for the U.S. Southwest wasn’t as bad as it seemed. Instead, evidence now suggests the last two decades are the region’s “new normal.”
“I was a Ph.D. student in 2012, and there was a consensus that eventually (the PDO) was going to flip,” DiNezio. “We had a big El Niño in 2015, and there was this idea that El Niño will flip the PDO back to the opposite, rainfall-producing phase. And we had that big El Niño event, and the PDO remained stuck. We just had an El Niño event in 2023 … and (it) also didn’t flip the PDO.”
“That’s the most important implication of  our findings,” he added. “That this drought is here to stay, unless we we do something about rising temperatures and global warming.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)In the quiet corners of Idaho — Bonner and Boundary counties — where neighbors wave from passing cars and acknowledging neighbors still matters, something unsettling has taken root. The handshake, once a symbol of trust, is now shadowed by ideological scorecards. A new playbook is unfolding, and the rules are being written in rooms most Idahoans will never enter.
The stories of Republicans Rep. Mark Sauter and Sen. Jim Woodward are not isolated tales of political contest. They are warnings. Warnings of what happens when conscience is punished, and control becomes the highest value.
 Manufactured dissent and the illusion of betrayal

Take the Bonner County Republican Central Committee’s vote of no confidence in Sauter. Was it about performance? Principle? Or was it a choreographed act of party purification— a signal to those who think for themselves that deviation will be punished?
Sauter supported education funding, common-sense health care provisions, and resisted attempts to censor libraries. Woodward stood firm on abortion exceptions, budget transparency and a consistent approach to civic policy. Yet both were vilified. Not by the general public, but by operatives who frame moderation as betrayal.
“This is not about public service — it’s about ideological obedience.”
 The machinery behind the message

These attacks don’t form in daylight. They emerge from back rooms and obscure donor rolls. The Idaho Freedom Foundation and its affiliate Idaho Freedom Action function as ideological enforcers — not just issuing policy positions, but publishing scorecards, endorsing primary challengers and drowning elections in hyperbole.
Behind them stand shadow networks like Donors Trust and the State Policy Network — national groups that shield billionaire backers and fund far-right campaigns across the country. Their goal isn’t better Idaho policy. It’s control. If a candidate like Sauter or Woodward won’t follow the script, the machine finds someone who will — and funds them to the hilt.
I call that “dark money governance,” and that’s exactly what it is — unelected influence in a state that prides itself on sovereignty.
 Ideology over Idaho

The talking points? “Freedom.” “Choice.” “Constitutional conservatism.” But the actions tell another story — defunding public education, dismantling social services and redirecting taxpayer dollars to private interests.
Scott Herndon’s campaign against Woodward was a case study in distortion: twisting nuanced votes into political grenades, vilifying civility as weakness. Now the same tactics are being aimed at Sauter: cherry-picked votes framed as betrayals, balanced decisions distorted into dogma.
In past editorials on political extremism I called this what it truly is: “ideological colonization.” The scripts aren’t written in Idaho — they’re imported.
 The cost of conscience

And still, these men stand. Woodward didn’t hide from his critics — he met them, clarified his views and continued serving. Sauter ran without the local GOP’s endorsement — and won. Neither man surrendered principle for praise.
They remind us of what governance used to mean: showing up, listening, deciding with care. It isn’t always flashy, but it’s real. It’s Idaho.
As it has been said before, “Leadership isn’t loud — it’s loyal to the people, not the platform.”
 A call to clarity

Idaho now faces a choice. Not between left and right, but between reality and rhetoric. Will we elevate those who serve quietly and thoughtfully? Or will we hand the reins to operatives who answer only to distant donors and unforgiving dogma?
The attacks on Mark Sauter and Jim Woodward are more than politics — they are philosophical ruptures. We must decide whether our communities deserve representatives who think and feel — or only those who comply.
Let us not confuse volume with virtue. The loudest voices may not speak for the people — they may speak for the strings being pulled behind them.
And in that clarity, we just might reclaim the Idaho we know.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)West Tennessee Healthcare is piloting a new technology that uses artificial intelligence to help case managers prevent patients from being kept in the hospital longer than necessary.
The nonprofit health care system will test Dragonfly Navigate, a product designed by Franklin-based AI technology company Xsolis to streamline administrative decisions between a patient’s hospital admission and discharge.
West Tennessee Healthcare serves around half a million West Tennesseans, including residents in rural areas, and began construction of a new Bolivar Hospital in July. WTH has used other Xsolis products since 2022. 
The new workflow technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) and real-time data from the hospital to model whether a patient can be discharged and where they should go after leaving the hospital (a skilled nursing facility, home, or to long-term care, for example).
“When a patient is in the hospital longer than what the model is predicting, then it alerts the (case manager) to go back into the case to look to see what’s stopping the patient from being discharged,” Xsolis CEO and founder Joan Butters said.
Barriers can include uncompleted testing, X-rays, treatments, doctor signatures and more. The workflow technology aims to help case managers quickly identify these needs without manually combing through clinical data and documentation.
“Our models are not meant to replace the clinical determination or the clinical expertise of the people that are using our solutions,” Butters said. “We are simply ensuring that they can get to that answer more efficiently.”

Debbie Ashworth, executive director of care management for West Tennessee Healthcare, said in a statement that the workflow will complement clinical expertise and “supports more proactive discharge planning, which will give my teams more time to focus on addressing patient needs.”
Starting discharge planning early helps cut down on extra time spent in the hospital due to logistics. If a patient is being discharged to a skilled nursing facility, for example, pre-planning can ensure there is a bed ready for that patient when they are cleared to leave the hospital, Butters said.
This can save the hospital, health insurance companies, and the patient money, she said.
“Every day a patient is in the hospital more than they need — an extra day — that costs the hospital, on average, about $3,000 a day,” Butters said. “If a hospital has 10,000 discharges and 20% of their patients remain in the hospital one day more than they need to, that’s millions of dollars … that they’ve lost … and that bed’s not available for new patients to come in as well.”
The workflow also helps cut out “a lot of the friction and the back-and-forth” between healthcare providers and insurance companies, she added. 
Patients may also see benefits.
“The longer that a patient stays in the hospital inappropriately, there’s higher risk of complications, increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, and higher risk of readmissions,” Butters said.
Xsolis’ AI models are retrained every quarter to adjust them to new conditions and patient populations. The company also goes through a series of annual audits covering data, system and physical security.

Missouri lawmakers are poised to return to Jefferson City next month to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts in order to gerrymander the Kansas City-based seat of Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. They’re also considering changes to the initiative petition process to make it harder for Missourians to change the state constitution. 
Both have been longtime priorities of the Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-right GOP state lawmakers whose quarrels with party leaders led to years of Missouri Senate gridlock.
Yet after years of holding outsize sway in Missouri politics, the Senate Freedom Caucus is down to only two members.

State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Harrisonville Republican and former caucus chairman, quit in June following a break with the group over a $1.5 billion incentive package to finance stadiums for the Chiefs and Royals. 
State Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also voted in favor of the stadium bill, soon joined him. He told The Independent last week that his differences with the caucus focused on tactics, not policy. 
“I’ve got nothing but respect for my friends in the Freedom Caucus,” Hudson said.
The departures mean only two state senators from St. Charles County — Nick Schroer and Adam Schnelting — are still aligned with the Freedom Caucus. 
Schroer, who took over as caucus chairman after Brattin stepped down, insists the group is “stronger than ever” despite the loss of half its Senate membership. 
There are 11 members of the caucus in the House, Schroer said, and numerous candidates likely to join the group who are running in GOP primaries for open Senate seats next year. Not to mention, he said, Missouri’s secretary of state and two congressmen are Freedom Caucus alums. 
“I’m not concerned whatsoever that at this moment we only have two very strong senators,” he said. “And I think those numbers are going to grow. But just like in years past, there are going to be senators who may not be wearing the Freedom Caucus insignia, but they are going to be with us on 99.9% of issues.”
But the caucus’ dwindling numbers in the Senate, where its influence was always most acutely felt, has some wondering if its days in the center of the Missouri political spotlight are drawing to a close. 
Freedom Caucuses push for conservative state laws, but getting attention is their big success

It began in 2018, when a group of GOP senators formed what they called the conservative caucus. 
The group’s formation set off an escalating war with Republican leadership that culminated four years later when acrimony became so bad that the Senate adjourned a day early for the first time since a fixed adjournment date was set in the state constitution in 1952.
Soon after, the conservative caucus announced it was disbanding. 
A year later, six Republican senators — most of whom were part of the conservative caucus — announced the formation of the Missouri Freedom Caucus.  
And the Republican civil war resumed almost immediately. 
The 2023 legislative session saw Freedom Caucus members using near-daily procedural maneuvers to gum up the Senate. Republican leadership responded by stripping caucus members of committee assignments and musing about their expulsion. 
The 2024 session saw no improvement, resulting in fewer bills passed than any year in living memory, including the COVID-shortened session in 2020. 
Throughout the turmoil, the group kept losing members. 
State Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, quit in 2021, telling The Independent at the time that she grew tired of the group’s disruptive tactics. She went on to become majority leader and president pro tem of the Senate, routinely squabbling with her former caucus colleagues. 
GOP state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby left the group last year, saying she could no longer in good conscience be a part of “actions behind the scenes that defame grassroots and violate the needs of my constituents.”
Tensions in the Senate cooled this year, with term limits pushing key figures on both sides of the fight out of the chamber. The detente led to a much more productive session, marked more by partisan squabbling than GOP infighting. 
Deal to pay for Chiefs, Royals stadiums fractures Missouri Freedom Caucus

That changed after Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers back into special session in June to pass incentives aimed at keeping the Chiefs and Royals from moving to Kansas. 
The Freedom Caucus vowed to oppose the funding scheme, which it decried as a “handout to billionaire sports team owners.” But Brattin and Hudson voted in support of the plan after a provision was added making changes to local property tax bills.
Both were accused of betraying the caucus’ principles, with the group’s longtime political adviser publicly calling for the Freedom Caucus to “disband and join the uniparty that runs Jefferson City.”
Brattin quit soon after, saying he opposed the stadium funding but voted in favor after the property tax provisions were added that he believed would benefit his constituents. 
Hudson quit a month later. 
“I agree with the caucus probably on 95% of the issues,” Hudson said, “and I intend to continue to be allies with them and work with them on issues that we agree on. There have been some times where tactically, there may have been some disagreements where I may have wanted to go a different direction.”
Schroer said the fact that the legislature is poised to debate a congressional map that seeks to eliminate the Democratic-leaning seat in Kansas City shows the Freedom Caucus is anything but dead. 
“Back in 2022, the Freedom Caucus pushed for a 7-1 map and couldn’t get enough Republicans to help us,” he said. “Now we’re going to do it.”
The overarching goal, he said, is that the Freedom Caucus will pull the party to the right so the caucus will no longer need to exist at all. 
“When we’ve got enough of these strong-willed conservatives that are able to stand up to the establishment and stand up to special interest groups, hopefully at that point we’ll have a majority of the majority,” he said, “ and there will be no need for the Freedom Caucus.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/040925_schroer1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-18 06:56:43.885740

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Across Pennsylvania, counties and providers of essential human services are bracing for what many fear will be a protracted state budget standoff in Harrisburg that’s already nearly seven weeks past the deadline. 
For many, it’s bringing up fears of another impasse like in 2015, when lawmakers went nine months without finalizing a spending plan. 
While most Pennsylvanians won’t have noticed any change in their day-to-day lives so far, for some of the most vulnerable people in the state, that may soon change. That’s because, until a budget is signed by Gov. Josh Shapiro, state payments for county-run services — like child welfare enforcement, senior citizen care, county health department programming, and more — are effectively on hold.
So, county governments are beginning to dip into their reserves. Now, officials and the nonprofits they contract with are rushing to develop contingency plans for when those run dry.
According to reporting by Spotlight PA, more than $2.5 billion in state payments for education and human services will be delayed in the coming weeks if lawmakers don’t come to an agreement.
“We’re hearing somewhere around the middle of next month as being the time some counties may run out of those reserves,” said Kyle Kopko, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania. “Some may be before that. Some may be after. There’s going to be a lot of these human services that they’re mandated to provide, and if that’s the case, county commissioners are going to have to start looking at where they can move that money around.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For many counties, that will mean a temporary stop or reduction in some social services. For others, it could mean taking out loans against expected tax payments, which come with interest that won’t be covered by the state when a budget is eventually passed and signed into law.
“In October, if we get that far and there’s still not a state budget, there’s going to be some real financial pressures for counties,” Kopko said.
But some won’t be able to wait that long. While most have not had to disrupt services yet, the longer the budget stalemate drags out, the more likely that becomes. And for many county officials and service providers, the current impasse brings back memories of the longest in recent memory in 2015. It lasted nine months, and led to many cuts in services and loans that, in some cases, providers are still paying back.
For instance, the Pennsylvania Council of Children, Youth and Family Services represents agencies and nonprofits that contract with counties to provide child and family services. They help recruit foster families, get those families’ homes ready to take kids, staff group homes, and more. Collectively, they employ more than 12,000 people. 
While some receive money from federal sources like Medicaid, President and CEO Terry Clark says about 90% are paid or reimbursed for their work by counties. As it stands, those counties may soon be unable to pay them.
“Some of those providers, they’re going to continue to work, regardless of whether the county or the state is paying them,” Clark said. “They have to. They have to be there for those kids and families.”
While most child service providers have not had to dip into reserves yet, it’s been a scramble to figure out what they’re going to do if the budget impasse drags out any longer. That may mean cutting their workforce, temporarily lowering pay, halting some services, or foregoing pay altogether until the stalemate in Harrisburg is resolved. 
It could also lead to a situation that counties also face – taking out loans, with interest that won’t be covered by the state. Clark says some of the contractors he represents are still repaying loans taken out during the 2015 impasse. Back then, he says, more than 100 service providers had to borrow over $172 million.
“Some people, to get that loan, had to put up their personal property,” Clark said. “That’s pretty sad when you might have to have a nonprofit CEO take out a loan on their home and know that they’re never going to get reimbursed [for the interest].”
During that nine-month impasse, Clark was working on the government side, as a county administrator in York County.  He remembers what it was like having to triage social services, figure out how they could shift around funds, and take out loans on the county side.
“The biggest lesson I learned is a lot of these nonprofits, they just don’t have a lot of money sitting there waiting,” he said. “They don’t have a slush fund or rainy day fund like the government has.”
Janine Maust is the executive director of Aging Services Inc., a private nonprofit that partners with Indiana County to provide services for seniors. They provide free meals for seniors, help them with bathing, provide in-home services for some who can’t travel, and offer an emergency button service in case of falls or other health issues.
Since the June 30 deadline for Pennsylvania to implement a budget, her organization has implemented a spending freeze. Except for covering operating costs, like keeping the lights on, and paying employees and providers, they’re unable to spend additional funds. 
That has led to cutting back on social events they hold for seniors, or at least finding ways to hold events at little to no cost. It has also meant a growing waiting list for services. While the wait list began last April, it’s been growing and being exacerbated by the impasse.
“If we’re flat-funded, those waiting lists are going to continue,” Maust said. “We need money above what we’re allocated to take people off a waiting list.” 
Already, Maust said her organization is dipping into reserves, and looking at the possibility of taking out a credit line, the interest on which they’ll be responsible for without state help. She expects it will be around two to three months until that becomes a necessity.
“Once the budget is passed and signed by the governor, it takes probably 45 to 60 days to get the money to come in,” Maust said. That could mean, even if a budget passed, they may still have to take a loan.
“We’ll have to pay interest on that, and we’ll have to use dollars to do that that could be spent on older adults,” she added.
According to Brian Bornman, executive director of the Pennsylvania Children and Youth Administrators Associations, some service providers that work with vulnerable kids and the families that care for them, are already seeing cuts to their pay,
“Generally what I’m hearing is some are already starting to provide reduced payments to providers,” Bornman said. “It may start that month one, they’re paying 80% of the invoice, and then 60%, and on down.”

Bornman says that’s in part that’s because, while lawmakers and their staff will continue to be paid as a standoff continues, counties will not receive state funds that are typically directed to providers of child welfare services and other mandatory, county-run programs.
“One can go down a cynical road there, if they were so inclined,” Bornman said.
However, he stressed, while some programs may be cut, when it comes to crucial services like child protective programs, work will continue, regardless of what happens in Harrisburg.
“If you have concerns that any child is being abused, continue to call as you normally would, because those services are going to be continued,” Bornman said. “The child welfare workforce is incredibly dedicated, and the counties are extremely committed to making sure the kids are protected.”
Following safety net services, schools will likely be the next to feel the squeeze. Though, for now, many are able to operate as usual.
The Pottstown School District is an example.
“The reality is school districts get a decent amount of funding from real estate tax revenues, which are all coming in right now, said Pottstown Superintendent Stephen Rodriguez, superintendent of the Pottstown School District. “Nevertheless, the short term effects are negligible. The long-term effects are detrimental. So we would like for there to be a budget.”
Matt Vannoy, the vice president of the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and a school board director for Sharon City School District, said in a public meeting last week that, while many school districts have enough funds to last for several months, some will have to take action as soon as next month.

Those  districts, he said, may have to take out loans, with interest costs that will be passed to taxpayers, or delay purchases of things like textbooks, electronics, classroom supplies and other materials.
“Ultimately that trickles down,” he said of costs borne by school districts to offset a delay of state funds. “You’re hurting kids and you’re impacting your instructional programs.”
Vannoy said his own school district  is “not in a terrible spot as of today,” and has enough funding to last for four or five months.
Spokespeople for Gov. Shapiro and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) did not respond to requests for comment. 
A spokesperson for Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) sent a statement.
“The Senate passed a responsible short-term budget that immediately released funding for schools, nursing homes and human services,” she said. “Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats blocked that deal. Any cuts in services to schools, nursing homes, hospitals, and essential services lies with Gov. Shapiro and House Democrats to answer as to why they are holding the funds hostage.”
While the Democratic-led House rejected a stop-gap budget passed by the Republican-controlled Senate earlier this month, the House also passed a budget bill in July, which stalled in the Senate.
Leaders of both parties have blamed the other for the impasse, while emphasizing negotiations continue.
Mass transit agencies across the commonwealth are also feeling the squeeze, with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), the state’s largest transit authority, set to begin a 20% service cut later this month. They say deeper cuts will follow if the state does not increase their funding. 
Other transit agencies in urban, rural and suburban areas have said they would have to cut services as well if a budget with increased funding isn’t agreed to soon..",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shamokin3-1024x742.jpeg,,,2025-08-18 08:56:48.562036

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)SHELBYVILLE – A local church is urging its members to permanently remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
Pamela Wilson Federspiel, who has been director of the library in downtown Shelbyville for 34 years, says the action is tantamount to “stealing.”
But three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville defend what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”
  Austin Keeler
“Yes — we have urged Christians, both locally and across the country, to search their libraries for books that promote sodomy, gender confusion and rebellion against God — and if found, to check them out and never return them as an act of civil disobedience,” pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions, recently told the Lantern in an email.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out last year with due dates in late June 2024, said Federspiel. Some of the books were written for children, some for adults. (The list of books is at the bottom of this story.)
Federspiel did not identify the library patron and said the books were never returned after several notices.
The titles include “The Art of Drag,” “My Two Moms” and “My Two Dads.”
Chris Hartman of Louisville, executive director of the Fairness Campaign, said he has never considered “theft to be a form of civil action.”
He also said he has never heard of a church encouraging its members “to steal from a public institution. It is shameful, unfortunate and disrespectful.”
Such activity often backfires by making people, especially young people, curious about the books and giving them more attention, he said.
  Author Sarah Prager
Sarah Prager of Boston wrote one of the 16 books the Shelby County Public Library has “lost.” It is called “Kind Like Marsha: Lessons from LGBTQ+ Leaders”  and  is for juveniles. Amazon.com says it celebrates 14 LGBTQ+ people throughout history, like politician Harvey Milk, scientist and painter Leonardo da Vinci, Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Marsha P. Johnson, who took care of her trans community on the streets of New York City.
“My book is not about sexual acts. It is about real, caring people — and what is wrong about that? A library must always have a diverse inventory.  We can never let that change,” Prager said.
Complaints about books increase
The church posted its recommendation to check out certain library books and not return them in a 2 minute, 57 second video on its Facebook page on June 1, 2024.  Church leaders said recently their message has not changed.
“Friends, the Shelby County Public Library is promoting the vile LGBTQ agenda to groom and trans children in Kentucky,” a script accompanying the video says.
“Would you help us expose what’s happening here?” it asks before providing contact information for two library officials and listing books the church found objectionable. 
Complaints about books to public libraries are not new but are growing in Kentucky and the United States. There were 302 challenges to Kentucky public libraries in 2024, up from only 26 in 2023, according to the state Department of Libraries and Archives annual Statistical Report of Kentucky Public Libraries released in April.
But rare, if ever, is the practice condoned by the Shelbyville church for making books disappear from the shelves. 
“Strategically checking out books with no plans to return them as a method of permanently removing certain books from local public libraries is not a common practice, at least not one that has been reported to KDLA,” said Jill Midkiff, a spokesperson for the  Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet and the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives (KDLA).
  Suzanne Trimel
PEN America, based in New York, tracks book bans and fights censorship across the country. Spokesperson Suzanne Trimel said she has never heard of the  book-removal tactic recommended by the Shelbyville church, though some conservative churches have urged members to seek public office to be in a position to censor LGBTQ+ books. She’s also heard of hiding controversial books where they aren’t likely to be found on library shelves
PEN America has seen censorship activities in public schools and public libraries intensify, she said, as public libraries have responded to pressure by canceling author visits and drag story hours. 
Trimel said public libraries also have been under pressure from the “Hide the Pride” campaign, largely led  by a conservative Catholic advocacy organization called CatholicVote.  In 2022, the leaders of CatholicVote estimated 50 to 100 libraries were targeted for “Hide the Pride.” 
The campaign instructs parents to go to the children’s section of a public library and check out all “Pride Month” books on the display shelves. The parents return the books on time but place them on other shelves out of reach of children.
The Reformation Church of Shelbyville does not return controversial books removed from the Shelby County library.
The church’s stance
Pastor Dorris said the church became aware of the controversial books when a member took their children to the library and the “children were exposed to some of them. Upon investigation they discovered the remaining books.”
Like librarian Federspiel, Dorris declined to identify the patron. He said the family did not want any public attention. Records of books checked out by patrons of public libraries are not subject to Kentucky’s Open Records Act, said Amye Bensenhaver, co-founder and co-director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition.

Dorris said he is uncertain where the checked-out books are now. “They have not been destroyed to my knowledge.”
He said his independent church, which “shepherds 357 souls,” is taking a “public stand against sexual perversion being pushed upon children through taxpayer-funded institutions.” It will continue to take that stand without apology, he said.
“This is not literacy — it’s grooming,” Dorris said.
Asked about the removal of public property, Dorris said, “We reject the idea that civil rebellion is only legitimate when it’s done with rainbow flags or Marxist slogans. Civil disobedience is a biblical category when obedience to God and love for neighbor demand it.”
 Dorris said that when the church discovered the controversial materials in the local library, it contacted Shelby County’s state senator and representative. It also contacted the library’s staff and its board members “to express our deep concern and call for action.”
“No library staff or board member ever followed up with us, no request has been made for the return of these books, and — tellingly — the books themselves have not been replaced. Not that we would return them — but the silence itself speaks volumes,” said Dorris.
Matt Burgin, president of the library’s board of trustees, said Federspiel told the board about the situation but no one else has ever contacted him about the books.
The library has handled it like other cases of overdue books, he said.

Dorris said he did talk to then-state Sen. Adrienne Southworth, R-Lawrenceburg, but he would not divulge their conversation. She could not be reached for comment. State Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, did not return phone calls to her Frankfort office seeking comment.
Dorris stressed that the book action is not a formal position of the Reformation Church and “not every member of our church is aware of and agrees with these actions, and that’s acceptable. We don’t discipline or pressure members over strategy. These actions — like the permanent removal of library books — were taken by individual Christians under personal conviction. We support their right to act or refrain in good conscience.”
The library’s stance
The 16 books director Federspiel says are “lost” due to the efforts of the Reformation Church range in cost from $19.99 to $35.
The library offers a variety of books for a diverse community, she said. “All are library property.”
Library materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons, said Federspiel, who declined to have her photo taken for this article. “The library is committed to providing materials that meet patron needs. Materials that are not returned are not available for other patrons. Replacing lost material is costly.”
Amanda Perry-Davis, the library’s collection manager, said the library acquires books generally based on their popularity. That can be determined by various book reviews, journals and magazines. Library professional journals recommended the “lost books” as appropriate titles for each age level.
Patrons also suggest specific books to acquire, said Perry-Davis.
Federspiel, who is retiring at the end of the year, said several staffers also provide their input on what books to buy but the final decision is hers.
Federspiel said that most of the “lost books” had not been in high demand by library patrons.

The library left a voicemail message with the patron about the overdue books and issued three other notices before turning the matter over to a collection agency, Unique Management, after 60 days, she said. The replacement cost is added to the patron’s card but so far the books remain missing.
Church has other targets besides library
The church has engaged in more public protests, including against a now closed Shelbyville bar and a fall fundraiser in Cynthiana in which people dress up as witches.
The church protested The Barrel Room, formerly a bar in downtown Shelbyville, for holding drag shows and the city’s conference center for allowing “drag queens to dance in front of children.”The church branded Cynthiana “a hotbed of witchcraft” in response to the Harrison County seat’s Witches’ Day Out event. 
“These displays grieve the heart of God and signal our community’s descent into spiritual decay,” said Pastor Dorris. “We do not hate the men who perform in drag, nor the librarians, nor the critics who accuse us of being hateful. We love them enough to tell the truth — that Jesus Christ is Lord, that sin leads to hell, and that the gospel alone can set people free.”
 The Barrel Room closed in October. Vicki Jones Lee, a local gay rights advocate, said she saw several drag shows there. “We would hear the protesters outside, making a lot of noise. The shows would just go on,” she said.
A spokesperson for the conference center said the center became the site for a Pride event in the summer of 2023 “to help it find a public venue.

James Smith, executive director of the Cynthiana-Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, said “Witches Day Out” is part of the community’s annual Halloween festivities. Participants dress like witches and try to raise money for a needy cause such as helping a family whose child had brain cancer
“It’s not a cult, it’s not a religion. Cynthiana’s Witches Day Out is a fun, community event with 130-plus vendors, food, readings, and a Victorian seance-themed Crystal Ball on the first Saturday in September in downtown Cynthiana to kick off the fall season,” said committee member Sam Lunger.
“But it is disappointing to hear anyone say it involves witchcraft. Everyone is entitled to free speech but this is misleading and out of bounds. We do provide a free space for the church protesters.”
Drag shows and witches are taboo to the church but it has given most attention to books.
Consequences
Dorris, the pastor, expects “some sort of reaction against the church” for its book removal efforts but does not know exactly what that will be.
“We know there will be consequences for saying what others are afraid to say. We will not be silent. We will not comply. We will not flinch. Our duty is to God, and our aim is the good of our neighbors — even those who revile us,” he said.
Madison Markham, a staff member on PEN America’s Freedom to Read team, said, “The alarming rise of book bans and censorship in the country is and will continue to have devastating consequences in our communities in the years to come.
“Regardless of whether you are a student, a parent, a librarian, an author, or a community member, this is an issue that affects all of us. Access to books with LGBTQ+ representation helps LGBTQ+ people and their families feel seen, and builds empathy. Everyone deserves the right to read and to be exposed to diverse ideas and experiences.”
Mark Adler, director of the Paris-Bourbon County Public Library and last year’s winner of the Kentucky Public Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Award, acknowledges that community members have the right to voice their concerns about materials in a public library but suggested it be channeled through a reconsideration request.
Each individual library has its own reconsideration process, as each community is unique in its makeup just as the local library collections are, he said. “These reconsideration requests provide an avenue for community members to file objections while also providing a structured, consistent process for libraries to follow when requests are filed. We encourage community members who have questions to bring those directly to their local libraries so we can work with the affected citizens to address their concerns.”
Shelby County’s Federspiel concurred, adding a public library should always celebrate books for all kinds of people.
In 1903, when Andrew Carnegie built the library in Shelbyville and donated $10,00 to it  “he had inscribed on the floor as you enter …  ‘A University for the People,’ showing his dedication to unite communities,” she said.
“To this day, we proudly honor these words by acquiring acquisitions that celebrate both inclusiveness and diversity of our community.”

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on May 16 (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).Once upon a time, Missouri Republicans were proud to declare their independence from Washington, D.C., and anyone associated with it.
During Barack Obama’s administration, they authorized specialty “Don’t Tread on Me” license plates, decorated with the Gadsden Flag. A lot of red states have those now, but Missouri was a trendsetter.
Lawmakers were also fond of floating bills with “freedom” in the name. There was, for instance, a “light bulb freedom act,” a protest against federal energy regulations.
More recently, Republicans rammed through the Second Amendment Preservation Act, which tries to make it illegal to enforce federal gun laws in Missouri. It is unwise legislation that immediately ran into legal challenges, but it did reflect Republicans’ vaunted defiance.
I didn’t like any of those bills, but I kind of miss the defiance — now that so many Missouri Republicans have become quivering, gelatinous flunkies for Donald Trump.  
We are about to find out just how subservient our state’s leaders have become. Some time soon, Gov. Mike Kehoe is expected to announce if he will call a special session to redistrict the state’s U.S. Congressional districts. 
Most people are expecting he will. Of course he will. President Trump told him to. 
Missouri governor won’t confirm redistricting, but Republicans say it’s likely

In a bid to eke out every advantage for Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections, Trump is leaning on states with Republican governors and legislatures to redraw their Congressional districts now, instead of waiting for the next Census count, as is traditional in most states.
Kehoe felt cowed enough by Trump and his followers to do an about face on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. So he seems an unlikely prospect to withstand pressure from the leader now.
The aim of a special session would be to gerrymander Missouri’s Congressional districts so that Democrats have a reasonable chance of winning only one of eight. Right now two seats are obtainable for Democrats.
The likeliest scenario would be to distort the lines of the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democrat U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, to encompass more Republican-leaning territory. Jackson County would likely be split into two or possibly three districts, and the now-compact 5th District would stretch farther into mid-Missouri. 
This is a terrible idea. Republicans know that. They passed on extensive gerrymandering three years ago when they looked at redistricting Congressional districts after the 2020 Census. Saner lawmakers argued that such a radical redrawing of the lines would invite expensive court challenges and possibly dilute Republican strength in the districts they consider safe.
All that is still the case. But some things are different since the legislature preserved the 6-2 Congressional map in 2022. 
Since then, Missourians voted to make abortion legal and Republicans in Jefferson City have taken steps to reinstate the ban that the people overturned. Missourians, by a hefty margin, voted for paid sick leave for workers. The legislature’s Republican majority overturned that. For good measure, they also weakened a voter-approved minimum wage increase.
People’s attitudes toward a legislature that doesn’t respect their votes are toxic now. As a Jackson County resident, I can tell you that a gerrymandering scheme to hand one of Missouri’s Democratic strongholds over to Republican congressional representatives will poison relationships with Jefferson City for years to come.
Kehoe has said he feels a responsibility to “keep the (U.S.) House in Republican control.” 
What about his responsibility to his state and his constituents? Is his calling to Missouri or is it to Trump?
This foolish redistricting scheme, it should be said, is purely a defensive crouch for Kehoe and Missouri Republicans — a way to avoid incurring the wrath of Trump and the MAGA multitudes.
There will be no actual reward for blind obedience to the president.
Just ask Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey. He has turned his office into an auxiliary law firm for Trump. But when Bailey threw his hat in the ring for the job as FBI director, the president casually dismissed him after an interview. 
“He just didn’t have the presence in the room,” Trump reportedly said.
Few people have tried harder to ingratiate themselves with Trump and the MAGA movement than Josh Hawley, Missouri’s senior U.S. senator. In 2021, he became the first senator to announce he would object to the certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory, and he cheered the crowds that had gathered to storm the U.S. Capitol.
More recently, Hawley twisted himself into a pretzel trying to be a populist while at the same time staying on Trump’s good side.
First he said he wouldn’t vote for a bill that slashed Medicaid spending. Then he cast the decisive vote for Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which did indeed slash Medicaid spending. Then he introduced a new, dead-on-arrival bill to restore the slashed Medicaid spending.
All that, only to have Trump call him a “second-tier senator” a few weeks later, as Hawley attempted to take a stand on a different issue. 
This is the calculus for Kehoe. Call a special session and get the redistricting done and maybe Trump won’t blast him on Truth Social or exact some petty revenge down the road. But dysfunction in the legislature will worsen and so will the bad blood between the state of Missouri and Kansas City, its most dynamic region.
Courage is an elusive commodity these days. I think we can guess which way Kehoe will turn.  
Missouri earned its slogan as the Show-Me state in part because politicians through the years refused to take orders from outsiders.
We may have to change the motto on our license plates. Odds are Kehoe is about to turn Missouri into the Tell-Me state.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1968-e1747406679213-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

The six-month investigation, reported by Tom Loftus and John Voskuhl, found “the entire state-funded resurfacing program is plagued by a lack of competition.” 
Secretary Gray will recognize the names of the companies that benefited decades ago from the asphalt bidding schemes. According to the latest research published  by my organization – Kentucky FREE – many of those same highway contractors are still reaping the rewards from  the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet’s (KYTC) single-bid contracts. 
Our research shows that during the first six months of 2025, the Transportation Cabinet awarded $150,407,982 in single-bid asphalt contracts. Those awards translated to $12,765,410 in inflated project costs when compared to estimates based on competitive scenarios. Fifteen highway contractors secured single-bid contracts from January to June, however, six companies reaped 87% of their dollar value.
To be fair, some things have changed in the last 31 years.
Mountain Enterprises and Hinkle Contracting, once family-owned, are now subsidiaries of CRH-Oldcastle, the largest building materials company in North America. Also, Hinkle is part of a joint-venture with Nally & Gibson, another player in the single-bid asphalt game. 
Leonard Lawson, dubbed the “King of the Roads” by Loftus and Voskuhl, died in 2022. Steve Lawson, his son, now sits atop a road paving conglomerate that includes ATS Construction, L-M Enterprises, The Allen Company, Lexington Quarry and Walker Construction. 
In the 1980s, Leonard Lawson was an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal bid rigging trial. As reported by the Courier Journal, Lawson testified “he and another paving contractor agreed to cooperate on their bidding — splitting state jobs ‘right down the middle.’”
The days of contractors getting together in a room to divvy up territories are a thing of the past. However, a peer-reviewed study published in 2020 and co-authored by a University of Kentucky economist, raised questions of “tacit collusion” by the state’s asphalt industry. 
Tacit collusion refers to an implicit agreement among firms in an oligopolistic market to coordinate their pricing and output strategies. It can lead to higher prices and reduced competition, as firms avoid competition that could harm their profits. It’s revealed by patterns in bidding behavior over a long period of time.
The 2020 study argued that “stark evidence that county lines might provide a focal point for collusive bidding can be seen in the Lexington-Bluegrass market area.”  
Last year, the General Assembly’s Legislative Oversight & Investigations committee examined KYTC’s single-bid asphalt awards from 2018 to 2023. It found that “bidding is generally more competitive in counties surrounding Jefferson County and in northern Kentucky; counties (in the Fayette County area) have a high percentage of single-bid contracts even though multiple (asphalt) plants are in the region.”  
I’ve been examining asphalt bidding for five years. A small number of companies clearly maintain local monopolies. 
In central Kentucky (with rare exceptions), L-M Asphalt controls Fayette County, Lexington Quarry controls Jessamine and The Allen Company controls both Clark and Madison. Bourbon County is Hinkle’s and Scott County is Nally & Gibson’s. The Lawson-owned companies don’t bid into the CRH-Oldcastle counties and the CRH-Oldcastle companies don’t bid into the Lawson companies’ counties. 
L-M Asphalt has won countless single-bid projects in Laurel County, though none as eye-popping as the $147 million contract for an Interstate 75 project announced last week. It defies logic that the Transportation Cabinet couldn’t get another company to bid on such a big project. 
History isn’t repeating itself. The same story has continued unabated for decades. Unfortunately, the results are the same today as they were in 1994: The lack of competition wastes millions of the taxpayers’ dollars every year. 
In 2021, I testified about this issue in front of the interim Transportation Committee. Several legislators unloaded on me, trying to undermine my presentation with the industry’s talking points. 
Those legislators should’ve taken two lessons away from that committee meeting: Lobbyists’ talking points aren’t the same as facts and an industry that tries to silence its critics probably has something to hide.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-83455071-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., meets with Don and Sharon Zubke of Dickinson during a series of constituent meetings in Bismarck on Aug. 15, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)U.S. House Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., said she plans to continue holding one-on-one meetings with North Dakotans going forward, but poured cold water on the possibility of a public town hall.
Fedorchak held 10 meetings in Bismarck on Friday with those who signed up for time slots in advance. She also held similar meetings in Fargo last month with seven constituents.
She said was encouraged by the meetings and believes people just wanted “to be heard.”
“People came in with issues and only a handful of folks really had grievances about the current administration, or what’s going on,” Fedorchak said in an interview after the meetings.
She said the constituent meetings are only one element of her outreach efforts to North Dakotans. The virtual public forums, meeting with advocacy groups and organizations around the state and responding to messages will also continue, she said, which provide multiple layers of interaction.
“The town hall would not be as productive,” Fedorchak said. “I’m not interested in creating an environment that just further underscores the partisan nature of our political arena today and that’s what those town halls generally do. They are a forum for political theater that has turned into yelling and screaming, and not a productive conversation about the consequential issues.”
One North Dakotan with a meeting slot in Bismarck was Mike Larson of Carrington. He said “cruelty” prompted him to sign up for a one-on-one meeting with Fedorchak.

“We’re going backwards,” Larson said, prior to his meeting. “Everything. Just cruelty in general. It’s not her fault. It’s the party. The people. And I’m just kind of fed up with the cruelty. That’s the thing that bothers me the most.”
Larson said he has friends that he now describes as “people I used to know” because of their political disagreements.
After the meeting, Larson said Fedorchak listened and wrote down his concerns. He added he felt better upon exiting his meeting.
“I just hope she adheres to some of the things that I talked to her about and understands that there’s a lot of people like me that are very concerned about our future,” he said. “I hope she understands that a person needs to be an individual and make your own decisions.”
Fedorchak said she has crafted her political beliefs after more than 30 years in business and public service and she is a conservative, which shouldn’t surprise anyone.
“I am a Republican and I’m committed to the principles of the Republican Party and the conservative movement because I think they are right,” Fedorchak said. “Folks who don’t share those values are going to see it differently and wish I voted differently.”
Debbra Hill of Bismarck said she considers herself a Republican, but has major concerns about the high cost of child care and its accessibility. She also said she has issues with the way the United States is treating Ukrainian immigrants who fled their country, only to have problems with their visas being extended.

“I have friends from Ukraine. They say they are not deporting them, but if they can’t work and the government is not helping them … that’s a horrible way to treat our Ukrainian friends,” Hill said. 
She also expressed concerns about the country’s $37 trillion debt and that the Republican reconciliation package will add to that debt, not pay it down.
“We thought we were going to decrease our debt. We thought we were going to have a better quality of life. This is all reversed and I’m very disappointed,” Hill said.
After her meeting, Hill said Fedorchak justified the Republican tax and spending package, which is what she expected.
“She justified everything they have done,” Hill said. “We’re not going to have growth with high tariffs and we’re not going to have growth when we don’t have workers to do the labor.”
Hill said her opinion of Fedorchak did not change as a result of the meeting.
Fedorchak said the meetings proved that people can still have respectful discussions about important issues.
“I think everyone appreciated being able to be heard and hearing where I stand on issues, even if it’s different from them,” Fedorchak said. 
Some North Dakotans met with Fedorchak to address personal issues regarding their missing tax refund or problems with the visa process for a family member.
In a statement from North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer’s office, Cramer said he holds a regular series of radio town halls that are listed on his website, which provides opportunities for North Dakotans from across the state to participate.
“Whether a person is speaking into a microphone or telephone, they are speaking directly to me, with the only differences being they don’t have to get in their car or wait for a town hall to align with their schedule,” Cramer said in a statement. “I also make it a priority to be available to local reporters, and in fact most of them have my cell phone number. If I am going to represent North Dakotans the best way I can, I need to hear from them, but it’s too important to rely only upon 20th Century tools and tactics when we all know how quickly things move today.”
In a statement, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven’s office said, “Hoeven holds public meetings on issues important to our state and nation. These public events are in communities across the state, and North Dakotans are welcome to attend.”
The office said Hoeven has participated in meetings and discussions over the last several weeks involving: energy, border security, housing, grazing and flood protection. Hoeven is also available to meet with constituents regularly in Washington, D.C., and North Dakota.

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)As participation in Arkansas’ school voucher program has grown, so too has tuition at the private schools receiving state funds. 
Since its creation under the LEARNS Act in 2023, the Educational Freedom Account program has provided state money for allowable education expenses such as private school tuition. The program has been phased in over three years with increasing eligibility and is open to all students for the first time this fall.
Of the 164 schools that applied for the 2025-2026 academic year, 160 have been approved to participate, according to Arkansas Department of Education spokesperson Kimberly Mundell. Students used the EFA program at 97 schools in the program’s first year in 2023-24 and 126 schools the second. Additional schools were approved to participate both years, but did not have students who accessed EFA funds, Mundell said. 
According to an Arkansas Advocate analysis of private school tuition obtained through a public records request, the average tuition for the 2025-2026 year is around $8,800, which is more than the roughly $7,000 the state will provide each student this year.
The average tuition increase among the 93 schools that participated in all three years of the program was about $1,400, the Advocate’s analysis showed. 
North Little Rock’s Immaculate Conception Catholic School had the largest three-year increase at $5,725.
Under EFA program rules, ADE may prohibit schools from participating in the program if the department determines tuition or fee increases “are unreasonable or arbitrary.” Asked if a school’s proposed increase has ever been rejected, Mundell said “each private school’s tuition is reviewed individually to ensure compliance with state law.”
“The department reviews each school’s proposed tuition before granting approval for the upcoming year,” Mundell said in an email. “If any concerns arise, the department contacts the school to learn more.”

High and low tuition
Fayetteville Christian School, which has participated in the EFA program since its inception, doubled its K-12 tuition from $3,000 to $6,000 this year. Students paid between $700 and $850 in additional fees last year that are included in this year’s tuition cost. According to the school’s application, its superintendent sent the 2025-2026 tuition structure to ADE for review on Dec. 9 with an explanation for the increase. An official reviewed and “pre-approved” the increase the same day, according to the application. 
Calvary Christian Academy, which joined the program last school year, included in its application three reasons for increasing tuition by $2,900 to $6,200 this year. Officials said they didn’t previously charge “the full amount available,” so they wouldn’t financially hurt families ineligible for the EFA program. They also didn’t charge for some operational and technology fees, which they didn’t realize could be included in the EFA program. Additionally, the tuition hike will provide teachers and staff “a much-deserved raise,” according to the application. 
The largest year-over-year increase belongs to PLUM’s St. Howard’s Academy in Forrest City, which increased its tuition by roughly $5,100 to $12,000. The average tuition increase from last year among participating schools was about $860. PLUM Foundation is a nonprofit dedicated to community development in impoverished areas of the state, according to its website.
First-time participant Ewing Adventist Junior Academy in Bonnerdale has the lowest tuition at $2,000 for K-8 students. 
Bentonville’s Thaden School has the most expensive tuition at $29,300 for high school students. Head of School Michael Maloy told the Advocate last summer that Thaden offers “a robust financial aid program” that includes indexed tuition, meaning families pay according to their income.
Three new EFA participants, Excel High School, Northgate Academy and Veritas Scholars Academy, are not included in the Advocate’s analysis because instead of traditional tuition, the online schools’ charges vary based on how many and what type of courses students register to take. 

Doing more
Although Christ Academy received approval to participate in the inaugural year of the EFA program, principal Nyesha Greer decided to wait until this fall when all of her students would be eligible. 
The Newport school, which opened in 2018 and can serve around a dozen students in grades 6 through 8, is affiliated with a church and has previously relied on private donors and grants for funding. 
This will be the first year the school charges tuition, $6,500 per student. That’s just under the $6,994 being provided to each EFA student this year. The per-pupil EFA amount in the program’s first year was $6,672 and $6,856 the following academic year. Each year’s amount was based on the prior year’s per-student foundation funding for public schools.  
Greer said delaying participation in the EFA program “was the best decision.” The state funding will reduce stress on parents and allow the school to provide more programs and expand extracurricular activities, she said.  
“It just means we’ll be able to do a little bit more. It opens doors for us,” she said. 
Those sentiments were shared by Esmerki De Los Santos, principal of Fe Viva Christian School. The school is a ministry of Iglesia Bautista Fe Viva, an independent Baptist, Spanish-speaking church in Rogers. De Los Santos said the school provides instruction in English, but with a bilingual emphasis. 
Fe Viva joined the EFA program last year and is educating nearly 50 students in kindergarten through 12th grade this fall. The school’s funding was much smaller previously, and although money was “tight for a lot of parents,” De Los Santos said they educated students regardless. The EFA funding will enable the school to do more this year, such as providing students meals and additional resources, the principal said. 
“It’s life-changing. It’s life-changing for them, for the school,” De Los Santos said.

Tuition at Fe Viva is $6,000 for kindergarten through 7th grade and $6,500 for 8th through 12th grade. In deciding tuition, De Los Santos said they consider the cost of education and tuition prices in Northwest Arkansas.
“We are probably by far one of the cheapest here in the area just because we are working mostly with bilingual families,” he said. “We reach a lot of Hispanic families that would like to give their kids a little bit of Christian and better education, and so we reach out to families that wouldn’t be able to afford any other type of private school otherwise.”
While he’s grateful for state funding, De Los Santos said that, in the back of his mind, there’s always a concern about how the EFA program could shift in the future, such as new rules infringing on the school’s “religious liberty” or if funding runs out. De Los Santos said 80% to 90% of Fe Viva’s budget relies on EFA funding, and he’s not sure parents could afford tuition if the program goes away. 
Likewise, Greer said she’s mindful of how the program might shift once a new governor comes into office. 
“That has been a thought, but I’m not concerned,” she said. “The way I see it is we’ve been able to function before, and so this is not a determining factor whether we’ll be successful or not. This is just something that comes along and it’s a great help to us right now.”
Covering all applicants
The state has approved $277 million for the program’s third year; however, there are plans to fund every approved application, Mundell said. The deadline for schools and students to apply was Aug. 1 and Aug. 15, respectively. Mundell said it is yet to be determined if more students will be allowed to apply later in the year. 
As of Thursday afternoon, ADE had received 50,630 total applications — 29,836 private school students, 20,782 homeschool students, 12 incomplete. Of those, 44,599 had been approved, including 27,779 private school students and 16,820 homeschool students. 
By this same time in 2023 and 2024, ADE had approved participation for roughly 5,000 and 12,000 students, respectively. 
Of the currently approved students, 456 are former recipients of the Succeed Scholarship. The program, which was absorbed into the EFA program, provided private school tuition for students with disabilities, foster children and military families. 
Students who participated in the Succeed Scholarship during the 2022-2023 school year have continued to receive the scholarship amount awarded to them. Their funding has increased from $7,413 to $7,618 to $7,771 since the 2023-2024 school year.
The EFA program is only open to Arkansas schools, with the exception of the Madonna Learning Center in Tennessee, which has been allowed to participate in order to continue serving a former Succeed Scholarship recipient. The school will not be allowed to continue in the EFA program once the student graduates, Mundell said. 
ADE did not have data on when the last of the former Succeed Scholarship students are expected to graduate, but Mundell said graduation data will be presented in the annual EFA report. The program’s rules require that a legislative report be submitted no later than Sept. 30 each year. 



How we did it: 
Data was collected from Educational Freedom Account program applications provided by the Arkansas Department of Education through a state Freedom of Information Act request. Annual tuition rates for schools that provided weekly or monthly rates were calculated based on a 10-month school year.
Schools generally provided tuition rates for the 2025-2026 and 2024-2025 academic years. Some schools only provided one document for tuition rates. Although that may be because the tuition rate is the same for the current and previous year, only the tuition rate for the specific year listed on the document was included in the analysis.
Some schools included all fees in their listed tuition price, but the majority listed separate fees to be paid in addition to the tuition rate. The tuition rates in this analysis do not reflect discounts for things like being a church member or enrolling more than one child.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)With friction growing between the public and school leaders over policy decisions, Fairfax County Public Schools is in the process of hiring security for its superintendent due to the need for additional protection over safety concerns.
The move has left legislative leaders curious if similar proposals could occur at other school divisions around the region and beyond, as school leaders continue to be challenged by the public and face investigations for their decisions.
“I think that our superintendents do not want to have to spend their very scarce resources on something like this,” said Del. Laura Jane Cohen, D-Fairfax, a former Fairfax County school board member. “And I honestly believe, if you see this in Fairfax County, it is highly likely that these threats are happening all over the country.” 
The Mercury confirmed that school divisions in Falls Church City, and the counties of Loudoun, Prince William, Rapphannock and Frederick have not appropriated funds specifically for their superintendent’s security. 
Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest school division in the commonwealth, is likely the first to take such action. In a statement, FCPS told reporters that the “highly publicized tragic events around the country over the last several months illustrate the need to intensify and enhance security protocols at all organizations.”
Fairfax’s policy decisions have made targets of Superintendent Michelle Reid, the school board, and even staff, dating back as far as the pandemic. Chief among its critics have been parents, lawmakers and Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.
Some of the board’s decisions include overhauling school admissions at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology to promote greater diversity and resisting statewide transgender policies that would have forced schools to out transgender students or restrict pronoun use.
Fairfax, along with four other school divisions — Alexandria City, Arlington, Loudoun and Prince William — was also the subject of a federal investigation that determined their gender policies violated Title IX. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights proposed that the divisions rescind their policies and adopt biology-based definitions of the words “male” and “female” in all practices and policies relating to Title IX.
The division is also facing a criminal investigation after school staff were alleged to have helped minors get abortions without parental consent. Reid has denied the allegations.
The division did not immediately respond to questioning.
 The decision

Cohen said threats against school board members have stretched back to her time on the board between 2020 and 2023. During those years, she said someone would be assigned to follow her to her car or from other buildings.
Cohen said she feels confident in the office’s decision, given their assistance with her own security while she was on the board. She faced threats and successfully had a petition against her removal dismissed.
“If there are credible threats on her life, not only do you want to make sure that she’s protected, but you want to make sure that every time she goes into a school or is meeting with anybody that she is not a liability,” Cohen said.
In July, FCPS posted the job opening for an “executive protection agent” to work on a 260-day contract. The job would pay between $84,000-$144,000 per year. 
The job posting reads that the agent is responsible for “ensuring the personal safety, security, and operational continuity of the division superintendent across school campuses, public events, official travel, and private residences. This role requires discretion, professionalism, proactive risk management, and continuous coordination with internal stakeholders and external partners, including law enforcement.”  
During the same month, the school board met to discuss “public safety matters” and to “dispense with the attendance of the superintendent” during a portion of the closed session on July 17.
Following the job posting’s publication, WJLA reported that the security detail could consist of up to four positions. 
The Virginia School Board Association (VSBA) and School Board Member Alliance (SBMA) did not directly answer if they have concerns that Fairfax’s decision will set a precedent for hiring superintendents.
Instead, Gina Patterson, VSBA executive director, said in a statement that the decision made by the Fairfax County School Board is an example of their local control. 
“If the board and superintendent determined that this course of action was appropriate, it reflects their judgment on what they believe to be in the best interest of both their superintendent and their school division,” Patterson said.
In contrast, Shelly Norden, SBMA executive director, said the alliance believes the school board should instead prioritize more security officers at Fairfax’s elementary schools before the superintendent, costing the division at least $424,000 annually. She pointed out that the security detail could be an added expense considering there is already security at public events like board meetings and at the central administrative office.
“Adding a dedicated private security detail to these benefits would represent a further significant expense to taxpayers,” Norden said in a statement. “The school board holds the authority to approve or deny such requests. With declining enrollment and constrained budgets, this decision appears to prioritize administrative convenience over student safety.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Virginia-based abortion funds are citing an increased uptick in calls to their intake lines, as more people rely on their assistance to help cover the cost and sometimes travel expenses to get abortions. 
Since federal protections were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court three summers ago, various states have enacted restrictions or near-total bans on the procedure. With Virginia the least-restrictive southern state, several funds here told the Virginia Mercury in interviews they’re seeing a spike in assistance requests. 
But it’s not just from out-of-state patients, they said, as higher costs of living mean Virginians seeking abortions have also needed a boost from organizations like the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund (BRAF), Richmond Reproductive Freedom Project (RRFP) or Hampton Roads Reproductive Justice League (HRRJL). 
Over the past year, BRAF said it supported over 2,300 callers and saw a 54% increase in funding provided for callers. Before 2023, about 15% of people BRAF supported came from out of state, but that number now accounts for 25% of people the fund has served as of this year. 
“We’re seeing a ripple effect,” executive director April Greene shared in a recent call.
Other Virginian abortion funding groups echo that they’re seeing requests for assistance from North Carolinians, Georgians and Floridians in particular. 
Florida and Georgia ban the procedure after 6 weeks (a time when some people are just learning they are pregnant), while North Carolina blocks the procedure after 12 weeks. The longer it takes to afford, schedule and travel for an abortion and the further into pregnancy a person becomes, the higher the need to come to a state like Virginia, which caps most abortions around 26 weeks, rises.
Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court

A spokesperson from RRFP noted that out-of-state patients can strain the resources for Virginia patients too. But this is also why Greene, from BRAF, said several funds in various states remain in communication with each other. 
Greene explained that abortion funds are more than a fund for patients to tap into; they are also a source of moral support and information. 
This is particularly the case, she said, for patients who need to travel further for care, or ones who reach out with questions and are counseled or comforted by intake staff while they navigate delays in locking down appointments. Sometimes funds help patients book hotel rooms or flights as needed, or even talk someone through their pre-flight jitters if it’s their first time on a plane. 
“We’re sort of walking alongside people so much longer than people would think,” Greene said. “It’s not just ‘here’s 500 dollars for your abortion.’ It’s so much more than that.” 
Sara Blachman, a volunteer with the Hampton Roads Reproductive Justice League, said that the largest increase in out-of-state callers her organization has seen are people coming from Georgia or Florida. 
“Being located in Hampton Roads we have always had callers from North Carolina, and callers from our neighboring state seem to be increasing too,” she said in an email. 
Blachman added that the fund usually gets between 50 and 70 calls a week, despite only having the funding to make three to five pledges a week. RRFP relayed that their funding line was typically open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. prior to the overturn of Roe, but now, they are routinely flooded with calls and have had to close their line earlier in the day. 
“While some of this is due to more people and clinics knowing about us, more importantly it’s a reflection of the higher need we are seeing,” the spokesperson said. 
New River Abortion Access Fund, which is rooted in Southwest Virginia but like its counterparts connects patients around the state, has suspended its hotline for the time being. 
Its director, Val Washington, connected with The Mercury but was unable to follow through on an interview to glean more details by the time of this publication.
Meanwhile, the costs associated with getting an abortion in the first place has also been rising amid national inflation. As out-of-state patients seek to tap into Virginia funds, the RRFP spokesperson also noted cost burdens on Virginians. 
“People in Virginia need more support than before because the cost of living (which affects the cost of food, hotels, rideshare rides, gas, etc. around appointment dates) has increased without their wages increasing,” the spokesperson said. “Even a meal after an abortion is much more expensive now than it was five years ago, and that has nothing to do with overturning Roe.”
Newer to the abortion assistance landscape is State Line Abortion Access Partners (SLAAP), which has its “Last Mile Fund.” Anchored in Bristol along the Virginia and Tennessee border, the hyper-local fund “bridges the gap” for people who have secured money for abortion care but still need some help. The organization coordinates with other abortion funds to help transport patients to a reproductive health clinic in Bristol by reimbursing volunteer drivers for gas. 
With a rise in demand, sometimes the fundraising keeps pace, and sometimes it doesn’t.
Greene from BRAF shared that the fund noted a surge in donations around the time that Roe was overturned and supporting abortion access was top of mind for people feeling philanthropic. Those numbers eventually dropped, but Greene said that funds like BRAF began to strategize how to meet the needs of the people it serves and sustain itself. 
“We were incredibly lucky over the past few years to get some infrastructure,” Greene said. 
This came in the form of support through the National Network of Abortion Funds and tapping into other organizations. 
And while abortion funds aren’t directly affected by federal funding freezes, Greene still said funding organizations are watching with caution. 
For instance, three Virginia-based Planned Parenthood clinics have been waiting for federal funding tethered to family planning and cancer screening services for low-income people amid a federal funding freeze announced this spring. Though the funding is not connected to abortions specifically, the fact that Planned Parenthood clinics do provide the procedure has drawn ire from abortion opponents. Legal battles are also underway regarding other federal funding that clinics have historically received. 
Still, Greene said that BRAF missed out on some non-federal grant funding this year — necessitating a small budget reduction for the time being. 
“I think everyone’s a little tentative, a little bit unsure about what’s happening in the philanthropic landscape,” she said.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Chesterfield native Deborah Ragsdale spent the summer stressed out by  trying to find a new place to live. Her previous residence failed health and safety inspections, which are mandatory for landlords who rent to housing voucher recipients like Ragsdale, who is also disabled. 
Then, Housing Opportunities Made Equal, or HOME of Virginia, stepped in. The organization helped Ragsdale navigate her journey to a new home in Henrico County, a service they and similar housing organizations perform for thousands of Virginians each year.
‘A smack in the face:’ Vouchers holders fear federal housing cuts

“If I didn’t have her, if I didn’t have her voice, I don’t know where I would be today,” Ragsdale said of Teneika Jones, a housing specialist with HOME.
Vouchers help Ragsdale live independently and keep close to her grandchildren; she’s envisioning them playing at a park near her new home. The stress of finding a place to liveis finally melting away for her, but for nonprofit workers and others who aid in building housing safety nets, troubling new challenges are on the horizon as the federal funding landscape experiences seismic shifts. 
White House budget proposals earlier this summer sugget deep cuts for housing programs that Virginia has long relied on to help struggling renters, first-time homebuyers and those who are unhoused and in need of shelter. The federal funds at risk also support organizations that fight housing discrimination and generally assist people with locking down a place to live.
President Donald Trump’s budget requests would eliminate or reduce funding streams from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), including Community Development Block Grants, the Fair Housing Initiative Program and the vouchers that people like Ragsdale depend on. 
Nearly 200,000 homes in Virginia receive some form of support from HUD, according to an analysis from the Virginia Housing Alliance. About 50,000 of those residents use vouchers.
While recent movement in Congress shows the changes may not come to fruition in the next year, some funding changes are already unfolding for localities. For instance, Richmond’s public housing authority has stopped issuing new housing vouchers amid federal funding reductions. Those particular reductions stem from Richmond’s inability to utilize all of the vouchers it was funded for, essentially due to landlords not accepting them. 
“We are putting vouchers on the street,” Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority CEO Steven Nesmith told The Richmonder earlier this summer.  “But “landlords are saying — I’m just being real with you — ‘I’m not accepting those people.’” 
That’s where organizations like HOME come in to help. Spokesman Lance Warren said the “obstacles are all too familiar.” 
Though state law makes it illegal to refuse an applicant based on the source of funds used to pay rent, like vouchers, he said it’s not uncommon for his organization or the local housing authority to encounter landlords that refuse to comply. 
For now, voucher access and other federal housing funding aren’t “further hurt by Congress,” but they also aren’t “further helped,” Warren said. 
Existing voucher users are still facing their own hurdles, despite the assistance on paper.
Kimyade Richardson-Keys said he and his wife were rejected multiple times in the process of searching for apartments and homes this spring and summer before landing a place in Southside Richmond. He works at Chippenham Hospital and his wife is a caretaker. While they hope to eventually move to Chester, for now they are grateful for their place in Richmond. 
“We finally found the place we’re at now with a landlord who was extremely nice and pleasant and helpful getting us in there,” he said. 
It wasn’t easy though, Richardson-Keys said. He believes their status as housing voucher recipients made some places turn them away or string them along until they would walk away. 
“A couple of them were discriminating against us,” he said. “I think that was the basis of it because we have a good credit score, good rental history, so everything down the board was checked off.”
At above 650, his credit score is considered fair. Eligibility for housing voucher assistance is typically determined by income levels, not credit scores. Richardson-Keys’ credit score, which indicates he prioritizes paying bills on time and avoiding incurring too much debt, is part of why landlords review would-be tenants’ credit when approving or rejecting applications.
He attributed his family’s ultimate success to the “magic that Mrs. Jones was working.”
Jones, who used to work for RRHA, said she’s seen a variety of renters over the years that rely on organizations like HOME of Virginia and the housing authority to afford a place to live. Her experience helps her understand the concerns some landlords might possess around housing voucher clients, but she noted that the stigma is mostly inaccurate. 
“Do you have families that definitely don’t pay their portion or have damages to the house?  Absolutely, but it is a very small drop in the pond,” Jones said. “Most people work, they pay their bills — they just need a little help.”
More often than not, she said,  housing voucher recipients are misunderstood and judged. It’s a personal lived experience for her as well, having been a recipient at one point in her life. 
“I remember how people used to treat me,” she said, reflecting on the tough time she had as a single mother after her children’s father died. She brings that perspective to the table when helping her clients complete housing applications or relocate.
Jones said she feels like there are incidents where Virginia landlords have been able to discriminate against would-be renters without technically violating any laws. 
“We have great landlords that we work with, and property managers, but some of them have found ways to exclude people legally,”she said.
For instance, landlords can choose to not renew leases, or sometimes there are abatement issues like Ragsdale experienced when her property failed safety inspections and she had to move. Warren warns that it’s these cracks in the system that organizations like HOME watch out for and help people overcome.

As a child, I had a great deal of anxiety. If you’ve ever seen me speak in public, that might surprise you. But anxiety among children is extremely common and affects almost all children, to varying degrees.
During pre-pandemic times, researchers noted that as many as 7% of children had a diagnosable anxiety disorder that disrupted their everyday functioning. In addition, 20% had a tendency to feel anxious that didn’t rise to the level of a clinical disorder. And all children feel anxious at some time or another.
Most researchers have found that anxiety in children increased during and after the pandemic. Lockdowns that isolated children from their peers and interruptions to their routines may have accounted for the findings in these studies.
As a researcher who’s studied children’s mental health for decades, I know that predictability helps prevent anxiety in children. Predictability means things going along as they’ve always gone: sleep at night, up in the morning, cornflakes for breakfast, off to school, activities in the afternoon, dinner with the family. In Louise Fitzhugh’s children’s novel “Harriet the Spy,” Harriet’s mother can’t believe that her daughter always takes a tomato sandwich to school. Always. Harriet has no interest in variety. She’s perfectly happy with the same sandwich, year after year.
Anxiety will crop up for many children again this fall, and it can be intertwined with other feelings, such as excitement and shyness. Here are steps parents can take to help reduce their kids’ back-to-school anxiety and encourage a better start to the fall term.
1. Look for general symptoms of anxiety

	
Ask your kids how they’re feeling about going back to school, and keep an eye out for headaches, stomachaches, sleeping troubles, persistent “what if” questions, crankiness, excessive concern about very distant events, problems focusing on schoolwork and concerns that aren’t alleviated by logical explanations. An example might be your children worrying that they won’t have friends in school, even though they do have friends from their class last year; or concerns that while they’re at school, something extremely unlikely will happen, such as the house being hit by lightning.
What’s tricky, of course, is that any of these behaviors can be an indication of many different problems, so probe further. Talking to your kids about their thoughts may help you unravel whether they’re feeling anxious.
 2. Encourage activities that reduce anxiety

Playing outside, playing with friends or even just “hanging out” can be powerful ways to reduce negative feelings. Outdoors, people often feel more relaxed. Playing in an unstructured way – that is, without someone else telling them what or how to play – allows kids to work through their feelings and reduce anxiety.
 3. Limit kids’ screen time

Researchers have found that, post-pandemic, more children are using different types of digital devices, along with more social media apps. The significant body of evidence finding a link between excessive digital device use and anxiety suggests that these increases in device use may contribute to increased anxiety rates in children.
 4. Focus on family activities

The emotional connection that children have with their families is their psychological anchor during difficult times. At a time of increased stress and uncertainty, spending time with family can be an antidote. Take a walk or a hike together, eat dinner together, or play board games.
 5. Embrace distraction

Distraction isn’t a cure for anxiety, but it can diminish its intensity and help sufferers think more clearly about the source of their worries. When children are feeling very anxious, it’s fine to talk to them about how watching TV or reading a funny book can help them feel calmer.
 6. Get professional help when needed

If your child’s anxiety is interfering with sleep, eating, socializing or school attendance, and it persists beyond a few days, it’s a good idea to call your pediatrician or family doctor and report what’s going on. Medical professionals who work with children have seen anxiety skyrocket among kids, and they know how to get your child the necessary help.
As with any back-to-school season, you may find yourself shopping for binders and backpacks. However, children and their anxiety may also need your attention. Practicing simple prevention and intervening when necessary can get your kids off to a great school year.

If you buy your own health insurance in Arkansas, expect to start paying more in a few months — a lot more — thanks to Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump.
Rates for individual plans are set to rise by an average of 36% next year, according to proposed 2026 rate filings by BlueCross and Centene, the two companies that sell policies on the Arkansas Health Insurance Marketplace.
Most Americans who buy a marketplace plan get financial help from the federal government through tax subsidies created by the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, the 2010 health reform legislation often called “Obamacare.” But those ACA subsidies are set to shrink next year, and congressional Republicans refuse to extend them.




Some 166,000 Arkansans get their insurance on the marketplace as of now. Most of them will face a major rate hike — or simply be priced out of coverage — if the changes take effect.




Last week, Gov. Sarah Sanders said the companies’ proposed rate hikes are “unacceptable” and called on the commissioner of the Arkansas Insurance Department to reject them.







It’s tough talk, but talk is cheap. Health care is not. As governor, Sanders aims to cut health spending at the state level and supports Republican cuts at the federal level. If she truly cared about preventing rate increases for Arkansans, she’d call on Congress to keep the current ACA subsidies in place, or she’d find money elsewhere. Instead, she’s trying to distract us with fake populism by attacking a corporate villain everyone loves to hate — insurance companies.



The state Insurance Department isn’t answering questions about any of it, including basic questions about the agency’s timeline to make a decision about rates. But here’s what we know.




 Rates in real life


Rate increases are a fact of life in the perennially broken American health system. As the cost of doctors and hospitals and prescription drugs rises, so does the cost of insurance. Insurers file their rate adjustments for the upcoming year with the Insurance Department annually, which hires independent actuaries to determine whether the proposed changes are reasonable.
The rate hikes for individual plans in the past five years have been between 2% and 6%, as outlined here by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. That adds up, but it’s in the same ballpark as recent annual hikes for employer-sponsored insurance. A single-year increase of 36% is a different story.



And that’s an average increase. Costs vary from carrier to carrier, and the premiums on some Centene plans are projected to increase by more than 50%. Remember also that costs vary from person to person, depending on factors like age and family size.



So what’s happening here? It’s helpful to first back up for a quick refresher on how the Affordable Care Act works.
The ACA made insurance available to more Americans in two main ways. First, it expanded Medicaid, the country’s patchy safety net insurance program, to cover low-income households. “Medicaid expansion” is available to those making under 138% of the federal poverty line, a measure of income that depends on family size. In 2025, 138% of the poverty line was about $21,600 annually for a single person; for a three-person household it was about $36,800.
In Arkansas, the Medicaid expansion program is called ARHOME, and it gives essentially free coverage to some 230,000 people who are below the 138% threshold. The federal government pays for most of the cost of that coverage (90%) and the state pays the rest. (Medicaid expansion still hasn’t happened in some red states, like Texas.)
ARHOME could be affected by the proposed insurance rate increases too, thanks to some complicated quirks of how the expansion program is set up in Arkansas. But for now, the focus is on the second piece of the ACA — federal subsidies for individual plans sold by private companies on the health insurance marketplace.
For most people with incomes above 138% of the poverty line who can’t get insurance through a job or a spouse, buying an individual plan is the only option. To make the premiums on those plans more affordable, the ACA created a sliding scale of “premium tax credits” that depend on income. If you’re a single person in Arkansas making $25,000 annually, you make slightly too much to qualify for Medicaid expansion, but you can get a tax credit — a subsidy — that covers most of the cost of buying a private plan on the marketplace.
From the beginning, though, there was a problem with the ACA marketplace: The subsidies were too stingy. Some people signed up, but many others still found individual plans to be prohibitively expensive even with the subsidy. So while Medicaid expansion was very successful in getting more Americans covered, the marketplace was less so — until the COVID pandemic created an opportunity.
President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan made the ACA subsidies larger for everyone and also removed a cap on the upper end of the income sliding scale. Under the original ACA, people making four times the federal poverty level (400%) simply didn’t get any help at all and had to pay the full cost of insurance out of pocket. The Biden policy — which was later extended under the Inflation Reduction Act — gave modest subsidies to those above 400% as well.
The result was dramatic. In 2020, there were just 64,000 Arkansans insured through an individual marketplace plan. This year, with “enhanced” ACA subsidies now making insurance affordable, there are 166,000, according to the health policy nonprofit KFF.
The enhanced ACA subsidies are set to expire at the end of 2025, though, and Republicans have shown no interest in extending them. Insurance companies expect tons of people, especially those young and healthy enough to feel like they can risk it, to drop their coverage in 2026 as a result. And crucially, the people left behind in the risk pool will be sicker and more expensive to insure on the whole, thus driving up per-person costs.
To see this dynamic at play, it’s helpful to look at a specific example. The inimitable DIY health policy analyst Charles Gaba has run the numbers on Arkansas’ proposed rate hikes with and without the enhanced ACA subsidies. Right now, a 30-year-old single mom in Arkansas who makes a $40,000 salary can buy a solid, mid-tier insurance plan for herself for about $61 a month — a pretty good deal. (Her child will almost certainly be covered by ARKids, the Medicaid-funded program for children.) Without the enhanced subsidy, though, she will pay a $214 monthly premium.
That’s an increase of $153, or 250%. Will the average 30-year-old single mom with a $40K income pay $1,832 more annually to keep her health insurance? Or will she opt to pay for groceries, bills, child care, a vehicle and a roof over her family’s heads? There’s no question — unless she’s already sick. The only scenario where she’d prioritize buying health coverage is if she absolutely has to have it, due to a chronic illness, high-cost prescriptions or other health needs. And if she uses her insurance frequently, that will cost the insurance company more money — even as it has less money coming in the door due to other people dropping coverage.
Multiply this dynamic by tens of thousands of individuals, and the proposed Arkansas rate hikes make more sense.
Gaba runs through various other examples in his charts, including a four-person family with mom and dad both age 40. If they make $70,000 annually, they now pay about $138 monthly in premiums. When the enhanced ACA subsidies go away, that will more than triple, to $436 monthly.
Or imagine an older couple who are both 64 (just one year shy of Medicare eligibility) and make $90,000, placing them above that 400% poverty line mark. Right now, with the enhanced ACA subsidies in place, they pay a hefty $638 monthly in premium. That will become a back-breaking $2,915 monthly payment in 2026.
The enhanced ACA subsidies aren’t the only thing behind the rate hikes. General inflation plays a role, as do various other policy changes at the state level. But the insurers themselves say the main driver is that the subsidies are shrinking.
A filing from Centene with the Arkansas Insurance Department puts it this way: “Most notably, as [enhanced ACA subsidies] expire and enrollees face increased out-of-pocket premiums, we assume healthier individuals who tend to be more price sensitive will exit the market, worsening the average morbidity of the individual risk pool.”
(All the filings from the carriers can be found here on the Insurance Department’s website. Though there are six companies listed, note that they’re all some form of either Arkansas Blue Cross & Blue Shield or Centene. Centene is the parent company of Celtic Insurance Company (Ambetter), QCA Health Plan, Inc., and QualChoice Life and Health Insurance Company, Inc. Health Advantage, USAble HMO, Inc. (Octave) and USAble Mutual Insurance Co. are all affiliated with Blue Cross.)
A cynical ploy
The end of the enhanced ACA subsidies isn’t a direct result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, though it’s fair to conflate the two. The point of the bill was to prevent Trump’s first-term tax cuts from expiring. Republicans could have stopped the enhanced subsidies from expiring as well. But that would have meant less money for tax cuts.
Instead of preserving the subsidies, the Trump bill reduced federal health care spending by hundreds of billions of dollars in the years to come, mostly via Medicaid cuts that won’t kick in until after next year’s midterm elections. Republicans hope voters have short memories and aren’t planning ahead. But the surge in health insurance premiums is coming now, and not just in Arkansas. A KFF analysis found a median proposed premium increase of 18% nationwide.
Maybe that’s why Sanders is trying to get out ahead of this issue. Shouting and pointing fingers at the insurance companies might distract from the truth that her party set these price increases in motion by chopping health spending to pay for tax cuts.
Sanders wholeheartedly supported the Big, Beautiful Bill as written and cheered when it passed. She was even engaged in the legislative process, penning a Washington Post op-ed that urged Congress to strip out a policy on state-level AI regulation that she and other red-state governors objected to. She didn’t utter a word about the need to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies and still hasn’t, as far as we know.
But here she is, roleplaying as an economic populist about a rate hike created by her own party’s regressive policies. Note that there’s no trace of a solution in Sanders’ statement on the issue, and no mention of what might be causing it, other than BlueCross and Centene putting “corporate profits over Arkansas’s people.”
Strange words to hear from a governor who signed three rounds of corporate income tax cuts during her first 18 months in office, reducing state revenue collection from businesses by 28% last year, or $212 million. That’s money that could be used to help people afford health care. Instead, Sanders is looking for ways to cut health spending to make budgetary room for more tax cuts and school vouchers.
She’s looking to implement a Medicaid work requirement expected to kick thousands of poor and working Arkansans off their insurance in advance of the nationwide changes in the federal Trump bill. She’s made Arkansas one of two states in the country that yank Medicaid coverage away from new mothers just two months after birth (the 48 other states extend coverage to 12 months postpartum). And the bill that just passed Congress is going to cut Medicaid further over the next few years.
Americans are understandably furious at the insurance industry. Polls have shown a substantial minority of people are sympathetic to Luigi Mangione, the man who allegedly killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on the street in Manhattan in December. But the rot of the health care system goes far beyond greedy insurance companies. It’s just as much about doctors incentivized to perform unnecessary tests, hospitals that bill at wildly inflated rates for routine procedures, nursing homes seeking new ways to squeeze profit from residents and overworked CNAs, drugmakers and medical supply companies that game the system, and on and on.
Now, Republican policies are driving health insurance prices upward even further. With her acutely tuned PR antennae, Sanders knows the public anger is there. With her bluster and misdirection, she’s working hard to make sure none of that anger is pointed her way.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4531-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)“What are the consequences?” 
This is the question Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows kept asking during discussions of President Donald Trump’s efforts to change the voting process at the conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State, the oldest nonpartisan professional organization for public officials, in Biloxi, Mississippi earlier this month. 
The day after it ended, Aug. 8, Bellows officially responded to the U.S. Department of Justice’s request for sweeping voter data, questioning the federal agency’s intentions and asking that the request be withdrawn. She has yet to receive a response. 
“What we’re seeing right now is a dramatic expansion in federal power, coming from the Trump administration, over the states and the people that upends the very concept of our democratic republic,” Bellows said in a sit-down with Maine Morning Star after the conference. “Anyone who cares about states’ rights and individual freedom should be concerned about federal agencies engaged in an unprecedented power grab.”
Bellows, a Democrat who is running for governor in 2026, said she was reassured to hear from secretaries on both sides of the aisle who are concerned about federal intrusion into elections, which are administered by the states, not the federal government, under the U.S. Constitution.  
But she returned from the conference with more questions than answers regarding the Trump administration’s intentions and the repercussions of some secretaries embracing the federal requests.
Proof of citizenship
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order, but the legislation stalled and the order was halted by the courts. 
Some states have individually passed laws to require documented proof of citizenship to vote, including New Hampshire and Wyoming, whose secretaries of state presented at the conference. A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against Wyoming’s law in July. Two lawsuits filed against New Hampshire’s law are still pending in federal district court. 
“All of us agree that only citizens should vote in federal elections. That’s in the Constitution. That’s not the debate,” Bellows said. 
Rather, Bellows’ concern is how added requirements would work in practice and, she expects, could create barriers for legitimate voters, particularly in a state like Maine with sizable rural, low-income and senior populations. 
Already, people registering to vote must sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury. Noncitizens who register to vote or cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. 
One study of the 2016 election estimated the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast. However, conservatives in Maine and elsewhere have shared unsubstantiated claims of noncitizen voting.
“Then the concern becomes, from a very practical place, what is the impact on actual citizens and their constitutional right to vote?” Bellows said. 
In New Hampshire, some legitimate voters have been turned away due to the new requirements. Bellows, who oversees Maine’s Bureau of Motors Vehicles, says insight into potential impact in Maine can be gleaned from the rollout of Real ID requirements, which she says have tripped up long-time Mainers while being easier for new citizens who have their documents readily available.  
For example, she said, some people who grew up in Aroostook or Washington counties were born in Canada because the nearest hospital was across the border, so birth certificates aren’t a document they can use for citizenship proof. 
“We have heard from dozens of customers who have complained that it has sometimes taken them many months or almost a year to get certified birth certificates from other states if they were born out of state,” Bellows said, “or marriage information from other states. Particularly people who’ve experienced both marriage and divorce, those documents may not be documents that they have kept.”   
Seniors are the least likely to have that documented proof, partly because of higher likelihood of misplacement or damage over time, Bellows said, plus the added barrier of having to pay to get new copies. 
“Ironically, some of these policies are most likely to disproportionately impact senior citizens living in rural areas, which predominantly voted for Trump in the last election,” she said. 
With federal legislation and the executive order stalled, the Trump administration is attempting a backdoor way to accomplish its goal of requiring documented proof of citizenship for voting, Maine Morning Star’s partner outlet reports.  
The Trump administration is urging states to use an existing federal immigration database, called the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program, that it has refashioned into a platform to verify voters’ citizenship. 
Originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, searching one name at a time, SAVE can now do bulk searches, allowing for the scanning of full voter rolls. These changes also come as the U.S. Department of Justice is asking Maine and other states for copies of their voter rolls. 
Bellows told Stateline she had a recent phone call with officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who said the agency planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows told Stateline. 
Voting equipment
Another possible change to elections discussed at the conference was also part of Trump’s executive order but hasn’t drawn as much attention: directing the independent Election Assistance Commission to amend a set of security benchmarks for voting machines.
Donald Palmer, commissioner of the Election Assistance Commission who was nominated to the role by Trump in 2019, gave a presentation on how the commission is trying to implement the order by amending the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines to require paper ballots and remove bar codes and QR codes, which could lead to the decertification of certain voting systems.  
“The concern about that is that seems to be a path to decertifying the election or challenging legitimate election results held by the states,” Bellows said. 
Bellows sees the move as a way the Trump administration is setting the stage for more federal intervention in future elections. 
As a member of the elections committee of National Association of Secretaries of State, Bellows said she and other secretaries continue to meet every other week, sometimes more frequently as issues emerge, to press state and federal officials on the reasoning behind voting and election changes. 
When asked about other proactive measures she is taking, Bellows said she hopes to keep the state on its current path.
“Our greatest defense against what the federal government seems to be trying to do to undermine voter confidence and take over aspects of our elections is to continue to run really great elections,” she said.

(VCU Capital News Service)The Virginia Department of Energy has officially gotten word that funding for the Solar for All program — which aimed to help lower- and moderate-income households build solar panels on their roofs — has been rescinded by the federal government.
Virginia had been awarded $156 million that would have aided an estimated 15,000 households install rooftop solar or buy into community solar projects. The state had not started rolling out the program or taken applications yet.
The program that started under the Biden administration would have provided $7 billion to states to implement it. The funding was clawed back under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as part of government efficiency and the rollback of renewable energy programs enforced by President Donald Trump’s administration. 
“The bottom line again is this: EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video posted to X. “With clear language and intent from Congress in the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is taking action to end this program for good. We are committed to the rule of law and being a good steward of taxpayer dollars.”
Virginia had chosen to use the first year of funding to establish an avenue for implementing the program, meeting with stakeholders and formulating rules but had yet to select an administrator. Applications for the grants were going to open to the public in January. Now advocates for solar are frustrated over the loss.
“You know, having grown up in a low-income community, it’s just that same vicious cycle, right? Where folks say ‘we got this money, we’re gonna help you, we want to do this.’ And then at the 11th hour, it’s, you know, we ain’t got that no more,” said Branden Praileau, the Virginia Program Director at Solar United Neighbors.  ”It’s another sad commentary of the most marginalized and the most energy burdened, continuing to be left behind.”
Praileau explained that disadvantaged families would have benefitted from solar panels on their roofs by offsetting their energy bills with the production of energy from the panels. However much energy the panels produced would be subtracted from their energy bills each month.
“The ability to reduce that energy burden by offsetting what they produce versus what they consume, literally puts money back in people’s pockets,” Praileau said. ”I can speak from a life experience there. Since we’ve been solar at my church, we’ve been able to take the 25-30% that we’ve been saving yearly in energy, and roll it into outreach ministry.”
Richard Borean, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Energy, said that approximately $730,000 had been spent so far during the planning period and will still be covered by the funding previously awarded. The federal government will take back the rest of the unspent award. The department is in the process of creating a webpage called “Virginia Energy Connect,”  a one-stop-shop that will allow homeowners to find energy programs they qualify for cohesively. The site is expected to launch in the coming months.
Borean also highlighted efforts by the state to invest in an “all of the above” energy profile through renewable energy, nuclear, grid reliability, etc.
The reconciliation bill that was signed into law on July 4 also does away with the 30% tax credit for the installation of solar panels on homes starting at the end of this year. Praileau said this will create even more barriers for homeowners who are interested in solar for their homes but don’t have the means to pursue it without grants and tax credits.
Praileau said the rooftop solar projects would have helped cash-strapped households get repairs to their roofs for installation. He also pointed out that many of the homes that would have qualified for this funding have not been updated in decades and don’t have ways to become more energy efficient to lower their power bills.
Clean energy advocates have said they plan to appeal the decision to end the program since the money had already been allocated to the 60 recipients.

(Getty Images)Longtime Utility Consumer Counselor William Fine is leaving his post effective Aug. 31 — setting up an opportunity for Gov. Mike Braun to have a direct impact on utility issues in the state.
Fine has led the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) since 2017. The agency represents all Indiana consumers to “ensure quality, reliable utility services at the most reasonable prices possible through dedicated advocacy, consumer education and creative problem solving,” its website said.
Fine was appointed the 24th Utility Consumer Counselor for the state by then-Gov. Eric Holcomb and was reappointed in December 2020.
He led a staff of more than 50 professionals including attorneys, analysts, engineers, and additional employees who represent Indiana’s residential, commercial, and industrial ratepayer interests in state and federal utility regulatory proceedings.
Fine is retiring after 45 years of practicing law. Before joining the OUCC, he served in the Indiana House of Representatives and was a member of the Lake County Election and Voter Registration Board, the Indiana Public Defender Commission and the Board of Managers for the Lake County Bar Association.
His bio on the OUCC site said he is a former vice president and treasurer of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates and currently serves on its executive committee.  Fine was a member of Indiana’s 21st Century Energy Policy Development Task Force and was on the Critical Consumer Issues Forum Advisory Committee.
A Lake County native, Fine holds degrees from the Maurer School of Law, Purdue University and Indiana University.
Gov. Mike Braun will appoint his successor.
The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) will also be getting a new leader soon.
Current IURC Chairman Jim Huston announced his retirement in May. He plans to step down in January 2026 after more than a decade with the agency.
The governor appoints members of the IURC from among persons recommended by a nominating commission, and also appoints the chairman.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Heading into the respiratory illness season, states and clinicians are working to encourage pregnant patients to get COVID-19 vaccinations, even though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services no longer recommends that they should.
Along with being older and having an underlying health condition, pregnancy itself is a risk factor. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to developing severe illness from COVID-19. They’re also at high risk for complications, including preterm labor and stillbirth. The vast majority of medical experts say getting the shot is safe and effective — much safer than having the illness.
But HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in May that the agency would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine. Before testifying before Congress in June, Kennedy circulated a document on Capitol Hill claiming higher rates of fetal loss after vaccination. But the authors of those studies told Politico that their work had been misinterpreted.
Experts say the federal shift puts the onus on state health agencies to ramp up vaccine guidance and outreach. Clinicians and public health organizations are trying to dispel misinformation and make sure information reaches low-income people and people of color, who had higher maternal death rates during the pandemic. During the first two years of the pandemic, the virus contributed to a quarter of maternal deaths, according to federal data.
“We are severely disappointed,” said Dr. Neil Silverman, a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine. He has studied vaccines and pregnancy for the past 15 years and specializes in high-risk pregnancies.
Silverman called the federal shift a “public health tragedy on a grand scale.”
Health groups urge insurers to cover COVID-19 shots for pregnant women

Vaccinations against COVID-19 help prevent severe illness in pregnant people as well as their newborns, who are too young to get vaccinated, Silverman said. In what’s called passive immunity, vaccinated mothers pass on antibodies to their babies through the placenta and through breast milk.
“State public health agencies are probably going to have to implement vaccine guidance that differs from the federal recommendations. And that’s going to be an interesting can of worms,” said OB-GYN Dr. Mark Turrentine, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
Turrentine serves on a board of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that focuses on immunization and infectious diseases. He said his recent pregnant patients who had COVID-19 hadn’t gotten the vaccine.
“The change in guidance on the federal level just really makes a lot of confusion, and it makes it very challenging to try to explain to individuals why all of a sudden the difference,” Turrentine said.
A slew of public health organizations have been making a concerted effort to dispel vaccine myths. They include the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit organization of maternal-fetal experts. At a news briefing the society held this month, clinicians stressed the safety and long-standing science behind COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the shots for RSV and the flu. Cases of RSV and the flu tend to peak in the winter months, while in recent years COVID-19 cases have spiked in the summer and the winter.
Dr. Brenna Hughes, an OB-GYN who chairs the organization’s infectious diseases and emerging threats committee, pointed to survey data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that less than a third of eligible pregnant patients received COVID-19 shots, and only 38% received RSV shots for the 2023 to 2024 season. Less than half — 47% — received flu shots, and 59% received TDAP (whooping cough) vaccines.
CDC data shows that for last year’s and this year’s season, only between 12% and 14% of pregnant patients got the COVID-19 vaccine.
“The complications from the infection are so much greater than the complications and the very few and typically minor adverse events that might occur from the vaccine,” said microbiologist Sabra Klein, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
In June, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and 30 other professional health organizations signed a letter urging insurers to continue covering the COVID-19 shot for pregnant women, and have continued to urge coverage since then.
CVS Caremark, one of the nation’s three major pharmacy benefit managers, told Stateline it will continue covering the vaccine for pregnant women. The Arizona, California and North Carolina state Medicaid agencies also told Stateline they are still currently covering COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women.
Black maternal health advocates, researchers press on amid federal funding cuts

Dr. Kimberly Fortner, president-elect of the Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology, said during the maternal-fetal medicine briefing that she hopes medical groups’ joint messaging will bolster insurers.
“Hopefully by us linking arms, that can then help develop consistency so that insurers will continue to pay for the vaccine,” she said.
Exacerbating disparities
Dr. Ayanna Bennett, director of the District of Columbia Department of Health, said the federal government’s new stance has upended “a system that’s been stable for a very long time.”
Bennett said her agency used federal pandemic aid to shore up vaccine outreach efforts to communities of color. Now that flow of money is ending.
The changes in federal guidance and funding will “almost certainly exacerbate” maternal health disparities, said Marie Thoma, a perinatal epidemiologist and an associate professor in the University of Maryland Department of Family Science who researches pregnancy and COVID-19.
Black and Indigenous women died at higher rates. The virus exacerbated existing racial disparities in maternal health — and created new ones: Latina mothers, who generally see low rates of maternal mortality, saw deaths surge to 28 per 100,000 in 2021. Their rate was about 12 per 100,000 in 2018, according to federal data.
“We are going in with some exposure already that we didn’t have during the start of the pandemic. So, there will be some protection, but now that will erode,” said Thoma. “If we’re not getting vaccines, or if people are hesitant to take them, we could see some increase.”
Silverman said the administration’s efforts to strip mentions of race from government policies makes it difficult for institutions to reach populations at greatest risk. He called the dismissal of decades of data “saddening and infuriating.”
“The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most,” said Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council.
Many women “are trying to navigate an economic system that’s not always in their favor in terms of also providing access to the kind of educational material that they need,” she said.
Not just COVID-19
In June, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, replacing them with some members who are vaccine skeptics.
The change is creating chaos. Some states have vaccine laws, such as mandates for kids and coverage statutes, that are specifically tied to the committee’s decisions.











The politicization of the vaccine process, or access to it, is what concerns me the most.


– Dr. Yvette Martas, a Connecticut OB-GYN who chairs the board of directors of the Hispanic Health Council



The Vaccine Integrity Project at the University of Minnesota called on frontline health workers, health officials and professional societies to “counter the spread of inaccurate and confusing vaccine information.”
At a news briefing this month held by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, representatives from Alabama, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., said they will continue to recommend vaccines.
Alabama’s state health officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said clinicians will be instrumental in getting correct vaccination information to patients.
“We don’t think that we necessarily have the same authoritative voice that we might have had a decade ago in trying to guide people in what to do, but we do believe that people trust their health care providers in most cases and are certainly willing to listen to them,” he said at the briefing.
Bennett said she is hopeful that strong, consistent messaging from respected medical organizations will help combat confusion.
“Having established groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics or the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology make very firm recommendations that keep us essentially not changed from where we have been, I think, should reassure families,” she said.

Amber Roldan/Georgia RecorderCanceled pride graduation celebrations. Eliminated resource centers for LGBTQ students. Tighter rules for using a preferred name on class rosters and student IDs. These are some of the casualties on Georgia college campuses as a national push to erase DEI initiatives and programs takes hold.
University System of Georgia schools across the state have adopted a variety of changes in response to a flurry of federal orders from the Trump administration. Republican state lawmakers have also pursued a ban on DEI programs and policies in Georgia’s public schools and universities. 
Georgia Southern was one of the first universities in the state to roll back DEI initiatives according to Chanel Haley, deputy director with Georgia Equality, which advocates on behalf of LGBTQ Georgians. Concerned students reached out to Haley after the school cancelled graduation ceremonies that previously celebrated the achievements of LGBTQ+ students.
“I think that people need to realize it’s harm for everybody, not just LGBTQ students,” Haley said about DEI rollbacks.
In Atlanta, Georgia Tech dissolved their LGBTQIA+ Resource Center, Women’s Resource Center and Black Culture, Innovation and Technology team and moved them under the university’s Arts, Belonging and Community Department.
“Every university had a DEI office, and now we don’t, that’s a 180 degree turn,” said Matthew Boedy, who is president of the Georgia chapter of the American Association of University Professors. 
‘A place they can go’ 
With a student population over 45,000, Kennesaw State University is one of the larger public universities in the metro Atlanta area. Located towards the north end of Cobb County, KSU’s wider community has earned a progressive reputation in recent years. New policies at KSU have inspired a wave of opposition on and off campus as the community continues to express disappointment. 
Some of the changes have affected programs and policies that once benefited LGBTQ+ students. 
Ames West, a KSU senior, grew up in an evangelical household where being a part of the LGBTQ+ community was considered a “grave sin.” At KSU, West became a familiar face at the LGBTQ+ resource center and befriended numerous peers who shared similar stories. 
Last spring, KSU internally announced that the center would no longer cater specifically to LGBTQ+ students and would be rebranded as a part of a new Department of Student Engagement and Support. 
“This shift includes reorganizing various student programs into targeted support hubs focused on key areas like career readiness, academic success, mentorship, and well-being. KSU remains committed to student success, transparency throughout the transition, and full compliance with federal, state, and University System of Georgia guidelines,” KSU’s assistant vice president of communications, Tammy DeMel, said.
As someone who visited the resource center up to three times a week, West worried about friends and students who would no longer have a place to be themselves. Fueled by fear, West helped mobilize the Kennesaw Pride Alliance, a support network for LGBTQ+ KSU students, to look for solutions.
“I just couldn’t sit back and do nothing,” West said.
“We don’t care how much it costs, we don’t care how much it takes, we’re going to make sure our community on campus has a place they can go that has the support they need so that they do not feel left alone or like no one’s there to help them,” West added.
After spending the better part of their summer searching for a LGBTQ+ friendly space on campus, the alliance opened the doors to their new Kennesaw Pride Center in late July.
The new location is on the top floor of Kennesaw’s First United Lutheran Church, and the alliance hopes the student-run community hub and pride center becomes an inclusive spot for KSU’s LGBTQ+ community. 
Decorated with colorful flags, posters and an assortment of thrifted furniture, the center is ready to welcome students back to campus this fall. While the center will serve as a refuge to visitors in between classes, the alliance also plans to use the space to host social events including their annual pride gala.
Preferred name changes
Evelyn Priddy, a transgender sophomore studying computer engineering, expects to be directly affected by a new preferred name policy at KSU.
The change stems from a University System of Georgia policy. According to the USG Business Procedures Manual, the policy aims “to respect individuals’ preferred names while providing consistent identity management standards and reducing the risk of fraud by impersonation.”
USG notified institution presidents of the change last November and policy enforcement began July 1. Critics worry that the change has the potential of outing transgender students who no longer use their government-recognized names. 
Some transgender people refer to the names they were assigned at birth as “dead names.” For many, being referred to by a dead name can be hurtful or bring back painful memories. 
In previous years, KSU students hoping to go by a different name could submit a request to use a preferred name. Once approved, this name replaced the legal name associated with student registration. While official transcripts and degrees would still use the legal name, the policy allowed preferred names to display on student IDs and class rosters. 
Policy enforcement will now require a student’s preferred name to be placed in parentheses next to their legal name on all identifying documents.
“My legal name is going to be on every roster because I can’t file the forms to change it fast,” Priddy said. “I mean at this point I’m just gonna have to explain it. I hope I’ll be okay, but also, you could see how that could be a bit of a safety risk.”
For transgender students like Priddy who were given a name at birth that they no longer identify with, pursuing a legal name change is one of the only options. 
A legal name change process in Georgia is often a time-consuming ordeal. From paperwork to notary requirements and legal publishing policies, a name change can take weeks and become a costly feat. In Cobb County, notices must be published in the county’s local newspaper to notify community members that a petition to change a legal name has been filed. These notices must be published once every four weeks to meet the legal requirement.
In an effort to assist students directly affected by the new policy, The Southern Legal Center for Youth partnered with student organizations to host a virtual name change clinic to help students seeking a legal name change start the process.
Liz Harding Chao, the center’s founder and president created the organization after noticing a lack of local legal representation for youth in the South. As a LGBTQ+-led organization, the group noticed an increased need for legal assistance with name changes and offered support to KSU students. 
“For a lot of trans and gender-expansive folks, their dead name has a lot of baggage associated with it. It’s from a time that they often rather not remember or think about it,” Harding Chao said. 
Clinic clients represent themselves but law students and attorneys from the center help clients fill out the appropriate paperwork. The center also helps interested applicants fill out a poverty affidavit to combat any financial barriers.
Last week, KSU’s virtual clinic served seven students and accumulated a wait list with an additional 10. While the clinic helped students start the process of officially registering their preferred name, the legal change will not be completed before the first day of classes.

Chris Sununu, about 50 police departments are engaged in the accreditation process, according to John Scippa, the PSTC’s director. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)For decades, the Derry Police Department operated without accreditation. Officers followed policies  — some codified, others unwritten — intended to align with national standards. But no external organization audited and validated what was done.
Derry was not alone; despite the existence of a national accreditation organization since 1979, most New Hampshire law enforcement agencies have not sought or received accreditation.
But in January, that changed, when Derry obtained accreditation through a new program run by the state’s Police Standards and Training Council. It was the first New Hampshire law enforcement agency to do so.
Now, the department has a certification indicating it has implemented policies on areas ranging from reporting police misconduct, to arrest procedures, to social media use. And it must continually update those policies to address any changes from the state agency.
“They’re a living, breathing document. The standards change all the time,” said Derry Police Chief George Feole in an interview. “So that’s something that we need to be cognizant of.”
Derry’s embrace of the new program comes as part of a shift in policing in the state. Three years after the state accreditation process was created by executive order by Gov. Chris Sununu, about 50 police departments are engaged in the accreditation process, according to John Scippa, the PSTC’s director.
That 50 represents just a quarter of the more than 220 departments Scippa says exist in New Hampshire. But it is a jump up from the 15 departments that had begun accreditation in June 2024.
Today, four police departments have fully obtained the credential, Scippa says: Derry, Bow, Stratham, and Gilford. 
The PSTC is using word of mouth among police chiefs to try to drum up all interest. Enticing all agencies is still a challenge, Scippa said.
“Accreditation is important,” Scippa said in an interview. “We think it speaks to professionalizing (policing) across our state. But you know, we’re also very cognizant of the fact that there’s some agencies that are still, you know, down significantly with regard to just basic staffing.”
Born out of a recommendation by the Commission on Law Enforcement Accountability, Community, and Transparency (LEACT), the state accreditation committee came as part of a broader interest in police accountability. LEACT itself was created by Sununu in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. 
The wave of protests calling for police reform inspired many New Hampshire departments to implement new policies, officials say — for instance, prohibitions of the type of chokehold that caused Floyd’s death. And the movement spurred departments’ interest in accreditation as a way to validate those changes.
“CALEA looked at policies on neck restraints, vascular neck restraints, chokeholds, all those kinds of things,” said Capt. John Lavoie of the Durham Police Department, speaking on the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. 
“They rolled out an update and said, basically, all organizations need to have these changes. You need to prohibit this. We were already doing that here at Durham PD, so we’re proud of that, that we had already had prohibitions on that.”
But some saw the national accreditation process run by CALEA as expensive and onerous. CALEA certifications require four years of audits and compliance, which in turn can necessitate an increase in police bureaucracy and travel to conferences and trainings. For smaller departments, that can be prohibitive.
To address that burden, the LEACT recommended the creation of a state accreditation process that could be a cheaper, shorter, and less demanding alternative. Sununu’s executive order made New Hampshire one of 36 states to create police accreditation commissions, and pushed the Police Standards and Training Council to develop its own accreditation requirements for departments, separate from the CALEA ones.
“When we designed the accreditation program here, we made sure that the ability to become state-level accredited would not be prohibitive for smaller agencies that may not have, like physical infrastructure,” Scippa said.
Today, the PSTC has a 99-page document outlining a number of required policies for department certification. Some touch on how departments must report police officers who have been investigated for misconduct to the exculpatory evidence schedule known as the “Laurie List.” Others dictate how strip and body cavity searches, no-knock warrants, and arrests should be used and handled. 
In order to receive accreditation, departments must develop those policies and put them in writing. Then, they must pass an audit run by state volunteers in which the policies are examined and department staff are interviewed.
For Derry, that process meant some policies that were not in writing needed to be codified, and others that were already written down needed to be amended, Feole said.
“We’ve always conducted ourselves in the professional fashion and done things according to what we call the national standard, the best practices,” Feole said. “What we did is codified everything and sought accreditation review from the state, and the state said, ‘Yes, in fact, you do meet all these standards.’”
Feole, who became police chief in 2022, said he is unaware of why Derry did not seek CALEA certification in the years earlier. But he said since obtaining the state certification, the department is planning to begin the process to be CALEA-accredited by next year, and that he has set aside funds to do so in the department’s budget.
Some New Hampshire police departments are choosing the national accreditation over the state option. Durham, which has been CALEA-certified since 1996, and has been awarded a “Certificate of Meritorious Accreditation” by CALEA for holding its accreditation for at least 15 years, is one of them. 
Lavoie said the department has determined that applying for the state accreditation would be an unnecessary cost. Following the CALEA standards has allowed Durham to stay up to date on policing, and has helped the department’s standing in the community, Lavoie said.
For instance Durham police officers are trained to not engage in high-speed pursuits except in extreme circumstances, Lavoie said, a direct result of CALEA certification. 
In early August, Todd Selig, Durham town administrator, accompanied some members of the Durham Police Department to a CALEA convention in Little Rock, Arkansas, where the department formally received its four-year re-accreditation.
“What makes me most proud, though, is not just the paperwork, the reports, or our compliance with CALEA’s high standards, although all those things matter,” Selig said in a speech at that convention. “It’s the authentic way our officers and staff connect to the people we serve, such that the department is deeply woven into the daily fabric of Durham.” 
There are legal benefits to certification, too, Lavoie and Feole say. Having updated policies can help officers avoid misconduct, can lower insurance costs, and can help departments if they are sued, he said.
“If we were to ever be sued for anything, these policies would be reviewed,” Feole said. Showing that we meet national and best practices in state best practices is going to be beneficial to us.”
Both accreditation processes require that police departments conduct anti-bias training for officers.  New Hampshire lawmakers have recently passed legislation in House Bill 2, the budget trailer bill, banning “diversity, equity, and inclusion” programs in state and local governments. The new law states that “no state funds shall be expended for DEI-related activities, including but not limited to implicit bias training” and other programs.
But Scippa argued the anti-bias trainings required in the state accreditation process would not be affected by that law and would be allowed to continue.
“We have to make sure that the police are not acting in a biased manner, whatever bias that might be,” he said. 
The New Hampshire Speaker’s Office did not reply to a request for comment Friday about the intended effect of the anti-DEI law. 
Scippa and other law enforcement officials say they hope interest in accreditation will spread to the other 150 departments over time. But they acknowledged the process is voluntary, and that some agencies may not have the resources.
“Every department, in my opinion, should seek accreditation and improve accountability to the public,” said Feole. “That’s something that’s kind of on the forefront of everybody’s mind nowadays. It improves community relations. It builds trust in the community. It makes for a better relationship between the agency and the public.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/standardssign-1024x723.jpg,,,2025-08-18 05:57:12.008052

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Test wells at the Franklin County prison site yielded far less water than a typical home needs, much less a 3,000-bed prison, records show — and at least one state legislator took notice.
Well construction reports obtained from the Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Well Water Commission show the two wells drilled at the site on Aug. 1 yielded two gallons of water per minute and ten gallons of water per hour, respectively.
According to the New York State Department of Health, well yield “is a sustainable rate of water flow, usually expressed in gallons per minute (gpm), that a well can draw continuously over an extended period.”
The typical home needs six to 12 gallons of water per minute.
According to Arkansas Department of Health records, each of the four water wells supplying water to the DOC’s Tucker Unit uses 51.9 gpm on average, or 207.63 gpm across all four. The Tucker Unit is a 2,000-bed facility.
The well reports contradict what representatives from Vanir, the firm contracted to manage the prison construction, told the Board of Corrections about the test well flow rates at the beginning of the month. In their report to the board, Vanir said the test wells were yielding 15-16 gallons a minute and 5 gallons a minute, also noting that those numbers were preliminary.
The board authorized spending $50,000 to drill the wells in June, part of preliminary site work to determine whether the land can support the prison, which was not done prior to the state’s purchase of the Franklin County property.
Arkansas corrections board orders wells to be drilled at Franklin County prison site

Critics of the prison plan have questioned whether local infrastructure is capable of supporting the site’s water and wastewater needs since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced the land purchase last Halloween.
The site is roughly 26 miles from Fort Smith and 19 miles from Ozark. Fort Smith said earlier this summer that it could not support the prison’s water or wastewater needs. Ozark passed a resolution in February saying the town of 3,601 people couldn’t either, noting the prison would put substantial strain on its budget and infrastructure if the project moved forward.
Corrections board Chairman Benny Magness seemed to acknowledge the dwindling options for utilities for the project when the drilling was approved in June, saying that if the test wells proved unsatisfactory, the board would likely need to begin exploring other site options for the prison.
Magness did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion did not answer specific questions about the discrepancy or why it arose other than to say that all numbers are preliminary.
“At this time, all the reports and numbers we have are preliminary,” Champion said in an email. “Once those reports are finalized, it will give the Board and the Department a better idea of what we’re dealing with and next steps.”
Once the reports are finalized, Champion said, the results will be analyzed to determine “next steps.” However, much will depend on the architectural and engineering contract, he added. That contract still hasn’t been approved by the Arkansas Legislative Council.
During an ALC meeting Friday, Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, referenced the discrepancy in the yield amounts when questioning DOC Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown as the council considered approval of a routine on-call engineering contract.
“We’re getting so much misinformation, that I would like to know why, why you guys can’t get your facts straight,” said Stubblefield, who has been a vocal opponent of the Franklin County site.
DOC Chief of Staff Wade Hodge told Stubblefield he got his information about the test wells from Vanir and didn’t know about the other flow numbers.
Arkansas officials ‘kept in the dark’ over state’s land purchase for new prison

Adam Watson, another prison opponent who recently sent legislators a request for an investigation into the prison site selection process, said that regardless of what the correct yield number is, it won’t be enough to supply the prison.
“There’s no, no reality where those wells are capable of fulfilling the needs,” Watson said in an interview last week. “So the last ditch effort will be going to Ozark to see if they can pull water from there, which Ozark City Council has passed a resolution stating that the city is against this project and the way that it’s been handled.”
Watson said that if the state had done its “due diligence” before committing to the Franklin County property, everyone would have been better off.
“If they would have done their due diligence to start with … we wouldn’t be sitting here a year later with the most basic question about building a new prison still unanswered: Where the hell is the water going to come from?”

(Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern) Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

In many cases, the increased costs they’ll face will be so big that more than 100,000 will lose their coverage, they warn.
However, Ohio U.S. Sens. Jon Husted and Bernie Moreno, both Republicans, won’t say whether they’ll act to renew the program.
The subsidy is known as the “enhanced premium tax credit.” It was created during the coronavirus pandemic to make insurance purchased on the marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act more affordable. 
It’s available to people making between 100% and 400% of federal poverty guidelines. For a family of three, that’s between $26,650 and $106,600 a year. Nearly 20 million Americans and 530,000 Ohioans receive it.
More than 90% of those who get insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace receive the subsidies, and they’re set to expire at the end of the year. 
The average recipient saves about $700 a year because of them, the Center for American Progress reported. But some save much more, meaning they have a lot more to lose.
“A typical 60-year-old couple making $82,000 … would see monthly marketplace premiums more than triple, from $581 to $2,111 — an annual increase of roughly $18,400,” the group reported late last year.
The subsidies are credited with helping to push the percentage of uninsured Americans to an all-time low. That might be why, after initially being skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, 66% of Americans had favorable views of the law by June 2025.
After attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act in his first term, President Donald Trump has undertaken several other measures that some experts say will push the number of uninsured Americans up — a lot.
One is by cutting nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending over 10 years as part of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The law gives roughly the same amount in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans, and it adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit.
The Medicaid cuts are expected to add greatly to the ranks of the uninsured. KFF, an independent nonprofit, in June estimated that 11 million Americans would lose insurance because of them. In Ohio, 310,000 would lose insurance, increasing the rate of uninsured Ohioans by 3%, the organization estimated.
Emergency physicians have warned that creating huge numbers of newly uninsured people will strain hospital services for all patients — especially in rural areas where hospitals are already struggling.
ERs have to treat people regardless of their ability to pay. To cover those costs, hospitals will have to cut staff, leading to longer wait times, fewer services and negative health outcomes, the doctors say.
Expiration of the marketplace subsidies would make the numbers even more dire, experts warn. KFF estimates that between the loss of subsidies and the Trump Medicaid cuts, 16 million Americans will lose insurance, including 440,000 Ohioans.
If Congress allows the subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, those who receive them will feel the pain before those facing Medicaid cuts do. Medicaid work requirements — the biggest single way cuts to that program will be financed — don’t kick in until after next year’s midterm elections.
Americans for Healthy Communities, a nonprofit advocacy group, urged Congress to renew the insurance subsidies.
“By failing to renew the ACA’s premium tax credits, Republicans in Congress are jeopardizing the health of more than 500,000 Ohioans who rely on these credits to receive the care they need,” it said in a written statement. “We urge Congress, especially Ohio’s delegation, to quickly come to the table and work together on passing an extension of these tax credits before it’s too late. Congress still has a chance to renew the tax credits when they return in September — however, if they once again refuse to, millions will lose their coverage and millions more will face unaffordable, high premiums. The time to act is now.”
The offices of Husted and Moreno didn’t respond when asked whether they believed the insurance subsidies should be allowed to expire.

“I’m sure that part of the reason for us to continue to trail the country is because of the numerous service deserts, these are geographic areas where people do not have ready access to the necessities of life,” OACAA Executive Director Philip E. Cole said during a recent press conference.
This is the 32nd year the association, which represents 48 agencies across the state, has issued a State of Poverty report. 
A Delaware County resident is likely to live about 12 years longer than a Vinton County resident, according to the report. 
“These counties are separated by about 100 miles and 12 years,” Cole said. “12 years is a lot of life. This number reminds us that in too many cases, the life you live is determined at birth.” 
Poverty has many causes, he said.
“People like to say that poverty is about personal choices,” Cole said. “In most cases, that’s just wrong. It has nothing to do with the choices of those who live in poverty, as no one can choose their parents or their place of birth. It has to do with unequal access to the important resources people need to thrive in their life.” 
Service deserts 
There are 421 Census tracts across 72 of Ohio’s 88 counties that qualify as food deserts, according to the United States Department of Agriculture Access Research Atlas. 
Slightly more than 90% of those are in tracts where the poverty rate is above the state average and 41% are in tracts where the poverty rate is more than double the state average. 
Food deserts are geographic areas where residents have limited access to fresh produce, typically due to the lack of grocery stores or supermarkets. 
“Ohio’s service deserts disproportionately impact high-poverty communities in both urban and rural areas,” Cole said. “When families and whole communities have a difficult time accessing basic needs like food and medicine, that is normally a demonstration of lack of access to employment and other economic opportunities as well.” 
Cole slammed federal policy from the 1980s that no longer enforced anti-trust laws like the Robinson-Patman Act. 
“It kept small grocers, for example, and other small retailers in business by outlawing price discrimination, which could favor large retail businesses, especially chain stores, at the expense of the small retailers,” Cole said. “When this act ceased to be enforced, price discrimination was allowed to benefit the large corporate grocers and other retailers at the expense of small businesses.”
This wiped out small grocers and impacted low income areas the most, Cole said. 
“Food deserts are creations out of public policy,” Cole said. 
It’s not just food deserts, it’s also pharmacies. 
Ohio saw a 16% drop in retail pharmacies across the state from 2015 to 2024, according to the report. 
“Unregulated pharmacy benefit managers are simply allowed to put small pharmacies out of business with their payment structures,” Cole said. “People have less access to prescriptions and less access to those who understand the interaction of drugs.” 
There are also legal assistance deserts — 82 Ohio counties have less than one attorney per 700 residents, according to the report. 
Ohio has 13 maternity care deserts where there is limited or no access to maternity health care services, the report added.
Data from the report 
Athens County had the highest overall poverty rate with 25.3% and Scioto County had the highest family poverty rate with 17.6%. 
In highest overall poverty rate, Meigs County followed Athens with 20.8% and Mahoning and Pike counties were tied with 19.5%. 
Black Ohioans have the highest poverty rate at 26.9%, followed by Hispanic/Latinos at 21.7%.
Recommendations 
The OACAA had three possible solutions involving lawmakers at the state and federal level. 

Suggesting the Trump Administration enforce anti-trust laws like the Robinson-Patman Act to help bring small retailers back in business. 
Asking Ohio lawmakers to get rid of taxes on small business startups and offer them refundable tax credits for jobs they create with businesses they open in desert areas. 
Increasing the funding for Ohio food banks. 

“We need to make food available,” Cole said.

New Hampshire’s health care system is facing unprecedented challenges that could have major economic and personal consequences in the coming years. Changes in federal and state policy, combined with broader market pressures, are projected to result in significant coverage losses, higher costs, and reduced access to care — particularly in rural areas.
Nationally, that more than 15 million Americans could lose their health coverage in the coming year, including thousands of Granite Staters. Without insurance, individuals and families are more vulnerable to overwhelming medical bills when illness or injury strikes. Rising costs may also push more households into medical debt, strain family budgets, and limit access to lifesaving care. With nearly 184,000 Granite Staters — about 13.4% of the state’s population — relying on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), cuts to Medicaid and ACA programs could cause thousands to lose access to essential care, destabilizing rural hospitals and escalating costs for everyone.
Coverage losses and rising costs
Proposed funding reductions to Medicaid — estimated at $1 trillion nationally over the next decade — could lead to increased out-of-pocket expenses for enrollees, including copays of up to $35 for doctor visits. This change would be particularly difficult for low-income families, people with disabilities, and rural residents who already face limited health care options.
Older adults may also face higher costs for prescription drugs and premiums. Without continued support for Medicare drug price negotiations, taxpayers could shoulder billions in additional costs, while low-income seniors may pay thousands more each year for necessary medications and services.
For individuals and families purchasing insurance on the open market, industry estimates suggest that premiums could rise by an average of 18 percent in the coming year. Without offsets such as tax credits, some households could see their coverage costs increase by more than 70%.
Economic ripple effects
When people lose coverage or face higher costs, they often delay or skip care. A survey of more than 1,300 New Hampshire adults, conducted in 2024, found that over two-thirds (69%) said they delayed or went without health care due to cost. This can lead to more severe health issues and greater long-term expenses.
Half of New Hampshire’s acute care hospitals — or 13 of 26 — serve rural communities and survive largely on Medicaid support. Those hospitals and clinics — especially in rural parts of New Hampshire — may be forced to close or reduce services, driving patients to more distant facilities. As demand concentrates in fewer locations, wait times and costs can increase for everyone.
Emergency rooms, often the provider of last resort, could become overcrowded with uninsured patients, adding financial pressure on hospitals and contributing to rising premiums for insured patients. Employers may also face higher health benefit costs, which could limit wage growth or lead to reduced hiring.
Impact on credit and financial stability
Medical debt remains a leading cause of personal financial hardship in the United States. Recent changes at the federal level have reduced protections for consumers, meaning unpaid medical bills may continue to appear on credit reports. A lower credit score can make it more expensive — or impossible — to secure a loan, rent a home, or start a small business. For families already living paycheck to paycheck, a single medical emergency can create a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.
A New Hampshire challenge
New Hampshire’s aging population, rural geography, and reliance on a mix of small and regional health care providers make the state particularly vulnerable to these pressures. Many communities have only one hospital or primary care clinic within reasonable distance, and staffing shortages in areas such as maternity care and behavioral health already strain the system. Since 2000, nine hospitals have ceased labor and delivery services, doubling travel time for women in many New Hampshire rural areas.
If coverage declines and costs rise sharply, the impact will not be confined to the health care sector. Small businesses could face steeper health insurance bills, employees may delay necessary care, and towns could see reduced economic activity as household budgets tighten. The state’s ability to attract and retain a healthy workforce could also be affected, with long-term implications for growth.
Looking ahead
The future of health care in New Hampshire will depend on how policymakers, health care providers, insurers, and communities respond to these challenges. Transparency in health care pricing, support for rural providers, and collaborative problem-solving among stakeholders will be critical to ensuring that residents continue to have access to affordable, quality care.
The choices made in the next year will shape the health — and economic well-being — of Granite Staters for decades to come. Without real solutions and collaboration, these pressures will dismantle access — especially in rural communities. Protecting coverage, preserving rural hospitals, and ensuring equity in access are crucial steps toward securing health and economic stability for all Granite Staters.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/healthcostsnhg-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-18 04:57:41.429772

Here’s what you can do to get your money back.
For the first two weeks of August, Ohio’s 5.75% tax rate — and any local sales taxes — were paused.
“That doesn’t mean that all online or even in-person shopping experiences here in Ohio are incorporating it,” financial expert and Case Western Reserve University professor Michael Goldberg said. “Consumers really need to look.”
Viewers and readers reported that some stores weren’t honoring the state sales tax break, and they were still being charged tax. Ohio Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino (R-Kirtland) explained that the holiday is mandatory.
“It’s their obligation to follow the law, of course, and I guess businesses who decide not to pass it along will run afoul of regulators in the state of Ohio,” Cirino said.
Most products were eligible as long as they were under $500. This includes dining in at restaurants and internet purchases from chain companies.
There were some exceptions, which included items already separately taxed, like alcohol, marijuana or vehicles.
If you bought an eligible item between Aug. 1 and 14, but you had tax on your receipt, here is what you can do:
The Ohio Department of Taxation said that consumers should take their receipt, or show a digital copy, to the retailer for a refund.
If that isn’t possible, ODT’s Adam Schwiebert said there is another option.
“You can submit an application for a refund for that erroneously collected sales tax,” Schwiebert said. “You can submit that application electronically or via mail, so you have options to get your money back.”
CLICK HERE to go to the refund form.
If you can’t access the webpage from this link, here are the instructions:
CLICK HERE to get to the department’s website. Then click the “Forms” section in the upper right-hand corner. From there, type “STAR” into the “Form Title or Number” box. There should be a search result that says, “Application for Sales/Use Tax Refund.” Click “View PDF Fill-In.”
Consumers have four years to file for a return, but Schwiebert urges Ohioans to apply as soon as they see the error.
“The department is very passionate about getting people their money back quickly because that really is the purpose of the holidays and for Ohioans to save those taxpayer dollars, keep them within their pockets,” Schwiebert said. “The department works very quickly to try to get their money back as fast as we possibly can.”
The expected time frame to receive your money back from the state varies.

(Photo by Morgan Trau, WEWS)Ohio’s property tax working group met last week, where superintendents fought against county officials who were pushing to take money away from school districts in order to provide property tax relief.
With property taxes continuing to climb, Ohioans like Brian Massie have been begging lawmakers for some relief.
“The legislators are doing nothing to address the injustice of taxing people out of their homes,” Massie said.
And the clock is ticking for solutions.
The state’s new property tax reform group met again to discuss initial thoughts, evaluating each of the Republican legislators’ proposals to decrease taxes — all of which could impact schools.
“We don’t think that people realize what’s on the line,” said Stephanie Starcher, the superintendent of Fort Frye Local Schools.


The members discussed a myriad of options, which include:

Idea 1: Take away some of the schools’ savings, capping the carryover revenue at a certain percentage and refunding to taxpayers anything above that.
Idea 2: Put restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. This would eliminate levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions. For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
Idea 3: Require that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
Idea 4: Allow a three-person county budget commission to unilaterally take money away from a school’s already passed levy if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
Idea 5: Similar to House Bill 186, this would limit property tax increases via an inflation cap. It authorizes a tax credit for owners of property in a school district on the 20 mill floor.

In the two-year state operating budget, Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the levy restrictions. In July, the House narrowly passed an override to it. This one is detrimental, both Starcher and Dublin City Schools Superintendent Dr. John Marschhausen said.
“Either Ohio kids are going to lose a ton of money, or taxpayers are going to be paying more for the same support,” Starcher said, noting that eliminating types of levies will cause schools to go to the ballot more frequently.
But group chair Bill Seitz, a former Republican lawmaker from Cincinnati, said limiting these levies would prevent unclear ballot questions that raise taxes.
“Substitute for what? The voters really have no way of knowing.” Seitz said. “What the hell are we substituting for?”
Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan said schools need to be held accountable, since some are just “sitting on taxpayer money.”
Lake County Auditor Chris Galloway said that this option would hurt local governments.
“If there was someone that thought that doing this was going to change the property tax situation for Ohioans, they’re out of their mind,” Galloway said. “This is not going to change the dollars and cents of average Ohioan voters on property taxes.”
Starcher and Marschhausen tried to explain several times how schools could be hurt by several of the provisions. But Galloway and Nolan were fans of budget commissions to take money away from schools.
“Having that hammer behind us to say, ‘Please lower your levies. If you don’t, we will do it for you’ — that has worked extremely well,” Nolan said.
Hamilton County Commissioner Denise Driehaus said that this was “undemocratic.”
“If three elected officials in Hamilton County decided to overturn the will of the people, I’m going to have an issue with that,” Driehaus said.
Pike County Commissioner Jeff Chattin echoed Driehaus’ thoughts, reminding the working group that voters and their choices must be taken seriously.
Massie said that he wants voters to have a choice and knows the taxpayers have to pay for municipalities, but not at his expense.
“To vote for property tax levies, you’re funding your own demise,” Massie said.
The group will continue working and discussing policy until their deadline of the end of September.

(Getty Images)Over the past month, both of Kansas’ U.S. senators and one of its representatives have been eager for Kansas Reflector to relay their thoughts to you, our readers.
What they haven’t been willing to do is answer real, in-depth questions.
In the aftermath of the Senate and House passing President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” into law, Republicans across the country want to persuade voters that they have delivered. Unfortunately for them, the bill polls terribly and constituents have been eager to confront their elected officials.
You can’t have that, not when control of both chambers will be up for a vote next year. Instead, these politicians have been trying to funnel propaganda directly to you, our audience, without pesky journalists asking a bunch of questions.
Sorry guys, but that’s not the way we do things around here.
This first came up with Sen. Jerry Moran. I’ve written a couple of columns about him this year, and others have also addressed him in this space. Back in 2022, he sat down with Kansas Reflector senior reporter Tim Carpenter for our podcast. Moran can hold himself perfectly well in an interview with a professional journalist. He’s been doing this for a long time.
So when his office reached out last month expressing unhappiness about a column, I thought it was a fantastic opportunity to request an interview with the senator. He did it before, right?
His staff didn’t see it that way.
Communications director Angela Lingg both emailed and tried to talk to me on the phone. I told her that we would be perfectly willing to correct any factual errors if the office wanted to point them out. That goes for any piece published by Kansas Reflector. The op-ed, which dealt with the effects of Medicaid cuts on state mental health services was indeed corrected with extra information. I was happy to do so.
However, if I don’t have a previous relationship with a public relations staffer, I’m not going to have an informal phone conversation with them about an article they don’t like. Let me tell you sometime about being harassed by a Hillary Clinton staffer one morning as the Concord Monitor worked on a story about her foreign policy.
It’s a waste of time and doesn’t do anyone any good.
As I told Lingg, I would be delighted to talk further about Moran’s vote and his role in the process — during an on-the-record conversation with Moran. If he didn’t want to talk to me, he could talk to anyone else on the Kansas Reflector staff.
She then asked if we would post an op-ed from Moran. I explained that as a matter of policy (which you can read here and which has been in place since I started four years ago), we don’t run pieces from elected officials or candidates for office. Again, I offered an on-the-record interview.
I haven’t heard back.
For two other Kansas lawmakers in Washington, D.C., our interactions were brief but similarly telling.
U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann’s staff sent along an unsolicited op-ed praising border security provisions in the law. I gave Mann’s communications director, Taylor Bradley Stanley, the same response that I gave Lingg. We can’t run the piece but would love to speak directly with the congressman. Again, no response.
Sen. Roger Marshall actually showed his face to local reporters as part of an photo op. He took a 10-minute air ambulance helicopter ride and answered a handful of questions. He didn’t sit down for the kind of in-depth, penetrating interview that one might expect from a serious legislator after passing a mammoth piece of legislation.
Let’s talk turkey.
We want to hear from your elected representatives. We want to know what they think and why they make the choices they do.
I would be especially interested in knowing why Moran — who has voiced his support for rural hospitals repeatedly — and Marshall — who has made his background as a physician core to his political identity — chose to vote for a spending package that will leave Kansans poorer and less healthy.
I would like to know why Mann — who represents Lawrence, thanks to some opportunistic redistricting — voted for a bill that so clearly contradicts the electoral preferences of this 95,000-person strong city. In case you didn’t know, Douglas County as a whole went 67%-30% for Kamala Harris over Trump last year.
Now, if you’re not accustomed to the concept of an adversarial press, you might think these questions impolite. You might think they’re uncouth or hostile.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Such questions are meant to put elected officials on the record. We want to hear what they have to say, directly from their own mouths in a context that they don’t control. We welcome these kinds of exchanges. We want our readers to hear what their representatives say.
Other elected officials have been willing to do so. U.S. Rep. Derek Schmidt sat down with Carpenter back in December. Miracle of miracles, he survived the experience no worse for wear. Likewise, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids frequently makes public appearances in Kansas and answers questions from journalists.
So what makes Moran, Marshall and Mann different?
I think all men are perfectly brave, accomplished and intelligent. I think all three could hold their own perfectly well during an interview or press conference. They are professional politicians. It’s what they do.
No, I think this reticence comes from the fact that these men can read polls. The reconciliation bill-turned-law remains unpopular and Trump himself has turned off massive numbers of Americans. What might be good for any one of these men to do politically — break with the White House or its priorities publicly — also puts them at risk of provoking the president and creating headaches they don’t need.
The simplest fix? Work the refs. Try to control the narrative. Don’t subject yourself to questions that would force you to take an unpopular stand. Don’t acknowledge the real trade-off behind the reconciliation bill and the grievous harms it will inflict on Kansans.
Honest dialogue would force these politicians to admit they have both compromised and been compromised.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.
Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.













When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon





Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.













There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections





Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)There’s historical precedent for Texas House Democrats vamoosing to deny Republicans the quorum they need to carry out President Trump’s order and redraw the Lone Star State’s congressional map to flip five seats from blue to red before next year’s midterm elections.
Some of the Texans fled to Illinois, where in December, 1840, a 31-year-old Kentucky-born Whig state representative jumped out a window to thwart a quorum House Democrats needed to pass a bill undermining the Bank of Illinois, a Whig pet.
The solon’s name was Abraham Lincoln.
His unorthodox exit went for naught because he had been marked present. The majority Democrats corralled enough members for a quorum, and the anti-bank bill passed 46-15.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXUnderstandably, it’s been claimed that Lincoln leapt from the Illinois statehouse, which is preserved as the Old State Capitol Historic Site. He didn’t. He bailed from a church window.
Springfield is the capital of Illinois. But in late 1840, the legislature was meeting in the old First Methodist Church while work crews were putting the finishing touches on the Capitol a block away. (The building was replaced by the current Capitol in 1876.)
The church was too small and ill equipped to adequately accommodate the lawmakers, which “added to the confusion Lincoln encountered as leader of the minority Whig party,” explains a plaque on a downtown building now on the church site.
The blue-framed “Looking for Lincoln” tablet is titled “Leaping Lincoln.” 
On Dec. 5, 1840, the Democratic majority was set to approve the bank-busting bill. The Whigs decided to make themselves scarce, thus preventing a quorum. “Only Lincoln and a few lieutenants remained to observe,” according to the plaque.
When Lincoln and other Whig bigwigs discovered the Democrats had a quorum after all, they ran for the door, which was barred. In desperation, Lincoln leapt, followed by Joseph Gillespie and Asahel Gridley.
The State Register, a devoutly Democratic newspaper in Springfield, gleefully reported the incident: “A laughable circumstance took place while the yeas and nays were being called on the passage of the resolution. Mr Lincoln of Sangamon (Lincoln lived in Springfield, the Sangamon County seat), who was present during the whole scene, and who appeared to enjoy the embarrassment of the House, suddenly looked very grave after the Speaker announced that a quorum was present. The conspiracy having failed, Mr Lincoln came under great excitement, and having attempted and failed to get out of the door, very unceremoniously raised the window and jumped out, followed by one or two other members.”
It was a first floor window, said to be only 4 or 5 feet from the ground.
According to the paper, “This gymnastic performance of Mr Lincoln and his flying brethren, did not occur until after they had voted! and consequently the House did not interfere with their extraordinary feat.”
The State Register confessed, “We have not learned whether these flying members got hurt in their adventure, and we think it probable that one of them came off without damage, as it was noticed that his legs reached nearly from the window to the ground!”
The paper further lampooned the 6-foot-4 Lincoln, declaring it had heard “that a resolution will probably be introduced into the House this week to inquire into the expediency of raising the State House one story higher, in order to have the House set in the third story! so as to prevent members from jumping out of the window! If such a resolution passes, Mr Lincoln will in the future have to climb down the spout!”
The plaque also says that “an embarrassed Lincoln ever after resented references to what he called that ‘jumping scape.’ ” But he had the last laugh 20 years later when Free State voters sent him to the White House. (He polled just 1,366 votes in slave state Kentucky.)
Historians rank “The Great Emancipator” as one of our greatest presidents because he led the Union to victory in the Civil War and put slavery on the road to extinction. (Illinois towns were named for Gillespie and Gridley.)

(Photo by Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXUnder Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Aug. 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)Three thoughts … 
Auschwitz. Treblinka. Bergen-Belson. Russian gulags. Manzanar. Heart Mountain. Lincoln.
Wait, what? Lincoln?
Go ahead. Insist I’m overreacting. Being a drama queen. Hyperventilating on the hype. Getting my NIMBY on. Maybe I am. But the idea that a federal migrant detention camp would be built where I live — already reported as a possibility — comes with a stigma. 
Nor would a camp in Omaha, Grand Island, North Platte or any place in Nebraska mitigate the mood. If Floridians want to embrace “Alligator Alcatraz,” the camp in the state’s swamps with the childishly cruel name, let them. But as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security searches for other detention camp sites, let’s hope Nebraska political leaders understand the long-term message such a place sends and the reputation that will follow.
Immigration is in dire need of serious reform. So some may welcome a camp here for migrants as part of the solution to the immigration problem. Indeed the president said on the campaign trail that a mass deportation will take place to rid the country of violent criminals, human traffickers and fentanyl pushers. 
To date, however, the data shows that a clear majority in detention camps or already deported fits none of that trifecta. Of interest, too, is that according to 8 U.S.C. § 1325, being in the country without documentation, with a few exceptions, remains a civil and not criminal offense.
Placing a migrant detention camp in the backyard may not last forever, but its memory would. Lincoln and Nebraska can do without.
School finance
With the dog days behind us and their namesake rightly in its heavenly place, most Nebraska’s schools are up and running. (We pause here to give thanks for air conditioning.)
Also at their desks starting last week were members of the governor’s newly-minted School Financing Review Commission, charged with building a better school financing mousetrap. 
Even a cursory look at school financing in Nebraska requires a trip down the rabbit hole when considering formulas and fairness. While the commission holds out hope it can solve some seriously hairy dilemmas involving property taxes and paying for a quality education, its initial conversations — as they should be — seemingly kept an aggregate eye on the prize: Nebraska’s public school students.
The old saw about showing me a budget and I’ll show what you value applies here. Nebraska schools have historically performed well in comparison to its border neighbors and the nation as a whole. In the constant push to lower property taxes, however, previous attempts not simply here but in other states have too often centered on painting school districts as spendthrifts or wholly inefficient stewards of money. The result has been a patchwork of policies that have satisfied neither those who pay property taxes nor those on the front lines of educating children.
Ergo, the School Financing Review Commission … and the balancing act which lies before it. 
History lesson
Speaking of schools, Nebraska’s history teachers should take note of a worrisome development at the Smithsonian Institution, the nation’s flagship museum of all things American.
The White House has sent a letter to the Institution’s director, giving him a heads up that the administration will be “reviewing” the museum’s exhibitions and research so they march to the same drummer as “the president’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.” The review would apply to eight Smithsonian museums.
Oh, boy. Democracies are, by their very nature, divisive. When the people make the rules, differences of opinion are not only evident and expected, they create a process of deliberation and debate that has made us the best last hope for freedom on the planet. Probably best not to mess with that.
Moreover, like book banners, if rewriters of history reveal only the good parts of the past, it’s not really history. Slavery, Japanese internment camps (two of which are listed above), the Tulsa Race Massacre, the mistreatment of Mexican Braceros and Jan. 6, 2021 — when for the first time in our nation’s history, a violent mob tried to undo a free and fair election — all happened, whether we like it or not. Not our finest hours. We must acknowledge them, study them and learn from them. Otherwise, the axiom is true: we’ll repeat them. 
Maybe we already are.
When we own all of our history, when we count all our wins and losses, when we let all of our true narrative be our teacher and not something to edit or erase, then we are unquestionably an exceptional nation.

Harvard), […]","Classroom at Andrew Jackson High School, Jacksonville, 1959, via State Library and Archives of Florida.It’s Back to School time in Florida and the state Department of Education could not be more excited.
Fired up! Psyched! Stoked!
We’re proud to be bringing these precious boys and girls (note the statutorily mandated unambiguous sex designations) the finest curriculum in these United States, handcrafted with love by Gov. Ron DeSantis (J.D. Harvard), Commissioner of Education Anastasios “Stasi” Kamoutsas (J.D. Regent), and your Florida Legislature, all of whom graduated from high school, probably.
Here’s a taste of what we have in store for your student!
Communism: The Kindergarten Mix
It’s never too early to teach kids how to recognize Reds and reject their sick ideology.
Teachers will illustrate the evils Karl Marx wrought by bringing in teddy bears (NB: Teacher will need to pay for these herself) which she will distribute as follows: half to traditional American (white) little boys; one-third to traditional American (white) little girls, and any left-overs to other kids.
Some will get no bears.
Then she’ll take the bears from the traditional Americans and distribute one bear to each kid, illustrating how totally unfair Communism is.
UnWoke Math (Grades 2-5)
The libs have tried to indoctrinate our children through addition and subtraction.
To combat this and make sure they don’t take against trickle-down economics in the future, the state has chosen textbooks especially crafted for Florida’s unique needs.
No sneaking in Critical Race Theory disguised as basic fractions, no social-emotional learning concealed in subtraction, no “If Bobby has three apples and he gives Maria one, how many does he have left?”
The correct answer is, obviously, Bobby still has three apples because Maria is now in ICE detention.
Civics (Grade 3):
America is great because America is good.
Like, Bible-good.
Despite the nonsense spouted by “historians,” children will learn early American colonists were Christians doing Christian things like making friends with primitive tribes, except when they got in the way of Manifest Destiny.
Sure, there were a few random Jews, and some of those African guest-workers helping pick cotton and tobacco were Muslims and idol-worshipers, but we won’t worry about them.
Language Arts (Grade 4): Reading is Fun-Da-Mental
Teachers will foster a continued love of reading with wholesome books such as “Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims,” the “Little House on the Prairie” series, and “Uncle Remus Stories.”
While some states encourage using “Reading Rainbow” in the classroom, we will not go that route.
Florida does not do PBS. It’s socialist.
Florida does not do rainbows.
That guy who hosts the program should stick to “Star Trek.”
American History (Grade 5): All the Best Wars
This course instills admiration for our nation and its armed forces through study of how we won almost every single war, from King Philip’s War (kicked Wampanoag butt!) to the Revolution to the Mexican War (we got California and Nevada!) to World Wars I and II (thanks to us, nobody’s speaking German!) to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Discussions of the War Between the States will emphasize there were fine people on both sides, acknowledging the South had a point.
We will not dwell on the Vietnam War; America would have won it if not for those darn hippies.
Health (S-E-X) Education: Bodies are Dirty
The state of Florida would prefer this topic be avoided. However, if a school chooses to offer this class, parents can opt to take their children to church or a gun show instead.
In any case, the state offers these important guidelines.
First and foremost, it’s all about abstinence. No touching. Not until you’re married.
No condoms on bananas. Boys should be told that girls transmit nasty diseases.
Instructors will be allowed to explain the basic biology of the business, including dire warnings to girls about the consequences of having sex.
No discussion of contraception. If you get pregnant, don’t even think about an abortion.
You ain’t getting one, Missy. Not here in Florida.
Science (Grades 7-8): Physics and Chemistry are Your Friends
Students will gain a thorough grounding in the best science, including the Laws of Gravity, illustrated by dropping footballs off second-story balconies, inelastic collisions as demonstrated when a defensive back tackles a ball-carrier at the line of scrimmage, and elastic collisions which happens when the quarterback throws a ball that bounces off the receiver’s helmet and lands in the hands of a running back who takes it 50 yards for a TD.
The chemistry unit will focus on how the Periodic Table of Elements lines up with the account of creation in Genesis: hydrogen and helium make the stars, then hydrogen and oxygen make water, then nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide make the air so that when Adam and Eve were created they had something to breathe.
Speaking of carbon dioxide, it’s a good thing, not a bad thing, no matter what the global warming alarmists say.
(Don’t worry, parents: The state has forced textbook publishers to remove references to climate change).
Civics II (Grade 9): America was Founded By God
There’s no question our Founders were divinely directed to create the greatest nation in history, and the teacher will make sure the kids never question this fact.
We explore the incredible awesomeness of George Washington, who overcame hardships such as smallpox, contracted when he visited the Caribbean in 1751, the difficulties of turning the crappy little cottage of Mount Vernon into a 11,000 square foot mansion, and terrible dental challenges.
Contrary to what you may have heard, Washington did not have wooden teeth. They were actually made of metal springs and levers, elephant and walrus ivory, and a few actual human teeth he bought from his slaves.
Our course will knock down other perfidious myths, such as the one perpetrated by Broadway that Alexander Hamilton was Hispanic and insidious rumors about Ben Franklin and French women.
Also, Thomas Jefferson was a devout Christian, no matter how many “historians” claim he had sex with a teenager and made his own cut-and-paste “Jefferson Bible” with all references to Jesus’ divine powers removed.
Shop (Grade 11): Learn a Trade! 
For too long education has emphasized academics, which is dumb, given how much money a good roofer makes.
No more. Young people will become expert in deploying a nail gun, putting up drywall, and laying bricks.
It’s now legal for kids over 16 to work 30 hours a week, school or no school, six days a week, and eight hours a day on holidays and weekends.
Schools could use this as a revenue-enhancing opportunity.
For the first 90 days, employers only have to pay the kids $4.25 an hour (bargain!).
That’s, like, $127.50 per kid per week! You get, say, 50 kids on somebody else’s payroll, skim off a 50% “Apprenticeship Fee,” and pretty soon the school is making enough to afford those new band uniforms.
Beats selling chocolate bars.
Foreign Languages: (cancelled)
Western Civilization (Grades 11-12): Our Way of Life
Sure, China and India are old and have built some pretty impressive walls and temples and whatever, but they fall short when compared to the brilliance of our European ancestors.
This course exposes young people to — as the great and not at all weird American author Edgar Allan Poe said — “the glory that was Greece, the grandeur that was Rome.” Socrates, Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca, colonization, aqueducts, togas.
The state Department of Education is following Florida’s own Marco Rubio, who has ditched the State Department’s whole “human rights” thing and created an office dedicated to “Western Values.”
Our kids will study those values — which include empire-building, unfettered capitalism, and freedom of expression unless it’s about sex or race — to learn how the West is the best.
Language Arts (Grade 12): Prep for College English
Students who insist on going into “higher ed” instead of getting perfectly good jobs at Chick-Fil-A or Disney will develop skills in reading complicated literature such as the plays of William Shakespeare and some of the few books not yet challenged by Moms for Liberty.
No Black books. No gay books.
Texts to be studied include “The Scarlet Letter” (see sex ed above), “The Iliad” (lots of good, clean war), and “Romeo and Juliet.”
(Teachers: Take out your Sharpies and redact the parts where Juliet starts talking about “amorous rites” and wishing “love-performing night” would hurry up so she can go to bed with Romeo. Disgusting.)
Sex stuff aside, the play teaches that if you disobey your parents, you’ll die.
College will challenge young people’s morals and values as professors try to indoctrinate them, forcing them to read novels by Toni Morrison, look at naked people in Art History, and acknowledge slavery was terrible, despite the slaves learning all those valuable skills.
But don’t worry: Kids educated in Florida have been trained to resist inappropriate thought.
And they can always report professors pushing DEI or CRT or BLM.
After all, Florida’s education commissioner is named Stasi.

Maldonado Mendez,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/18/upcoming-closure-of-st-francis-outpatient-behavioral-health-unit-threatens-mental-health-parity/,"For some, the impending closure of the Saint Francis Behavioral Health Department in Hartford is the loss of a lifeline.","On September 30, the outpatient behavioral health department at St. Francis Hospital is scheduled to close its doors. For many, this may seem like a routine administrative shift. But for those of us living with medical complexities, disabilities, and limited access through Medicare and Medicaid, it marks the end of a lifeline.

Doris Maldonado Mendez
My therapist at St. Francis is not just a provider —she is a witness to my life. She celebrates milestones with me, like the development of my children beyond their medical complexities, and the quiet triumphs of my own healing. She holds space for the unimaginable: the disappearance of my autistic son, the electric shock treatment to my heart after the devastating loss of my mother and three matriarchs during the COVID-19 pandemic and much more. She doesn’t flinch. She listens. She remembers. She reminds me that I am still here.
That relationship is built over time, through trust and consistency. And now, I am being told that even that sacred space is being taken away —with no clear or equitable alternative.
Disrupting therapeutic relationships is not just inconvenient —it’s destabilizing. Especially for those of us whose default prescription is “seek counseling,” when specialists routinely admit they cannot address our “unique” patient-centered needs. Counseling becomes the one place where I am not asked to explain or justify my complexity. It is simply honored.
This closure comes just weeks after Connecticut passes one of the strongest mental health parity laws in the country, mandating equal coverage for mental health and physical health services, imposing fines up to $625,000 for noncompliance, and requiring annual public reporting from insurers. Gov. Ned Lamont calls it a shift from “hoping insurers do the right thing to holding them accountable when they don’t.” And yet, what good is parity on paper if the infrastructure to deliver care is being dismantled?
And still, I rise.
As a former gubernatorial appointee and Chair of the Council on Developmental Disabilities, NAMI CT President and the Keep the Promise Coalition Chair, I’ve spent years creating opportunities for others —building statewide and national allyship, advancing communication access, and pushing for person-centered systems change. I lead panels, author strategies, and stand in rooms where decisions are made. But I also stand in waiting rooms, advocating for my own care, knowing that leadership doesn’t exempt me from systemic indifference.
I learn to breathe through the chaos, to pause when the weight becomes unbearable, and to return to what makes me thrive: my family, my faith, and my fierce belief that equity is not optional. Even when the system fails me, I refuse to let it fail others.
We are living through a national mental health crisis, compounded by economic instability, housing insecurity, and systemic inequities. The most vulnerable —those who are homeless, disabled, or medically complex— are being left to fend for themselves or fall through the cracks. We are being rendered invisible. Again.
It feels like 1999 all over again, when institutional closures and policy gaps leave thousands without support. We say “never again.” Yet here we are.
If Connecticut truly believes in equity, inclusion, and mental health parity, then the September 30 closure must be a call to action. We need legislation that not only holds insurers accountable but also protects access to care, funds community-based behavioral health, and ensures continuity —especially for those of us who cannot afford to be forgotten.
Mental health care is not optional. It is essential. And we deserve better. “¡Gracias!” to my therapist who ensured that there was Nothing about us Without us. Your humanity will be sorely missed!

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A group seeking to decriminalize Alaskans’ use of certain medicinal mushrooms and other psychedelics can start collecting signatures to try to put the question before voters.
Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom, who oversees the Alaska Division of Elections, said Thursday she has certified a statewide initiative application that proposes legal but regulated use of certain natural medicines for therapeutic and traditional purposes. The sponsors may now start gathering the petition signatures they need to place their initiative on a statewide ballot.
The proposed initiative, titled the Alaska Natural Medicine Act, is modeled after an initiative in Colorado that voters in that state passed in 2022.
Sponsors of the initiative are with Natural Alaska Medicine Inc., a nonprofit organization “dedicated to fostering charitable, educational, and social welfare initiatives that promote the safe and responsible use of natural medicines,” according to its website.
  A psilocybe mushroom is seen in this undated photo. The mushrooms are sources of psilocybin, which is metabolized in the body to the active drug psilocyn, also present in many of the same mushrooms. . (Photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration)
The president of Natural Alaska Medicine Inc. and other team members are Indigenous Alaskans. The proposed ballot initiative includes provisions for Alaska Native traditional healers.
While the initiative would decriminalize adults’ personal use or home cultivation of psychedelic mushrooms and other psychedelics, it also proposes a regulatory system. It would establish a Natural Medicine Control Board in the state Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development. And it would establish an advisory Traditional Use Council.
Certain psychedelics are excluded and their use would not be allowed, under the initiative’s wording.
To qualify the initiative for the ballot, the petition sponsors must gather signatures equal in number to 10% of the voters in the state’s last general election, according to the Alaska Constitution. Additionally, signatures must come from at least 30 of the state’s 40 legislative House districts. Sponsors have a year in which to gather those signatures.
In her announcement Thursday, Dahlstrom did not indicate a position on the proposed initiative.
“This certification reflects the constitutional and statutory requirements for citizen-led initiatives in Alaska,” she said in a statement. “While voters will ultimately decide the merits of the proposal, the application meets all legal criteria for form and content.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
States scramble to complete renewable energy projects before tax credits expire

Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

Ivan Hodes, a U.S. Army veteran, was among a group protesting Friday morning at the Government Hill gate to JBER. It was important to be at the base gate, “in front of the place where it’s happening,” he said.
“We object to the summit. We object to Putin being on American soil. We object to him being on a military base, specifically a military base that has been at the forefront of defense against Russian and Soviet aggression for 60, 70 years. We want to object to (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy not being invited. Without the victim of Russian aggression, it’s an exercise in carving up somebody else’s territory.”
For Hodes, there is also a personal aspect to his opposition. A West Point classmate, Andrew Webber, died in July 2023 in combat defending Ukraine, he said. “Everything I’m doing here is to honor his memory,” Hodes said.
The biggest event was likely the afternoon rally on the Delaney Park Strip in downtown Anchorage. There, Ukraine supporters unfurled a 136-foot-long Ukrainian flag that had been flown to the city earlier in the day from New Jersey. Owned by a nonprofit organization, it is the second-largest Ukrainian flag in existence, rally organizers said.

Supporters gripped the edges of the flag and held it aloft above the park’s grass, while photos were snapped by a drone buzzing above.
Art Davidson, an Alaska author and co-founder of a U.S.-based organization that provides humanitarian aid to Ukraine, was a featured speaker at the downtown event.
He said the large gathering was gratifying to Dr. Olga Shpak, the executive director of the organization, Assist Ukraine, and others in Ukraine, Davidson said.
“It means so much to them to see support from everybody,” he told the crowd. “A big, big, big hug from Olga, Dr. Olga Shpak …. And a big hug from the people on the front lines.”
Davidson and veteran war correspondent Anne Garrels founded Assist Ukraine in the early days of the war. The organization has been sending donations to Ukraine from around the world and has opened an orphanage in the country, Davidson said.

Former Lt. Gov. Loren Leman, a Republican who also served in the state Senate, was among those who attended the pro-Trump rally.
He said he hoped the Trump-Putin summit would help end the war in Ukraine.
“What’s happening there, it’s a tragedy,” he said. “I’m hoping that the discussions will result in peace.”
Asked who he believed was at fault for the war, Leman paused before answering.
“Ukraine was invaded. That shouldn’t have happened,” he said. But there may be fault on both sides of the conflict, he said. “There’s probably some fault in everybody. We all have faults.”

BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.












 When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances. 


–  Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon




Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.











 There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside. 


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections



	Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered some retiring coal plants to stay online, even as they have struggled to remain economically viable. (Liam Niemeyer/Kentucky Lantern)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.

Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Across the country, farmers and small entrepreneurs are adding drones to their fleet of tools for tasks like spraying agricultural chemicals or spreading seeds for a cover crop.
Today, the majority of the ag-drone market is made up of Chinese manufactured machinery, which some federal laws seek to outlaw, largely due to national security fears.
Those in the industry, however, wonder if the budding American ag-drone market is ready to fill the gaps in the event of a U.S. ban on Chinese drones — which could begin at the end of the year.
 How and why drones?

Drones have slowly integrated into the agricultural sector. The price tags and ability to go out and spray right after a rain make them attractive options for farmers who would otherwise risk getting a spray rig stuck in the mud, or wait on the local aerial sprayer to fit them in their schedules.
Cory Maassen attended a spray drone workshop Tuesday in Clear Lake, Iowa, with his father, who farms corn and soybeans near Avoca, Iowa. The younger Maassen, who plans to take over the farm when his dad is ready, said he has been looking into drones as an option to add a supplementary revenue stream to the farm operation.
The Maassen property is under 1,000 acres, so Maassen figured adding a custom sprayer business could help build some longevity in the farm operation.
“To have a different income stream would be nice as well,” Corey Maassen said. “It’s cheaper than buying new land, it’s cheaper than buying a new sprayer.”
Maassen’s plan is in line with a lot of spray drone operators. Some farmers will buy a couple of drones for their property and make some cash spraying a neighbor’s field too. Others have built custom spraying businesses with a fleet of drones.
A traditional ag sprayer, one driven in the field, could cost upward of half a million dollars. A new spray drone costs between $25,000 and $60,000, depending on size. Granted, there is a tradeoff in time as a drone can spray a 20- to 30-foot swath at a time, compared to 120-foot booms that could come on a traditional sprayer.
“This is a fraction of the cost,” Maassen said. “And if it holds up as well as what they’re saying it can, it pays for itself within a year or two.”
Doug Dodd, a drone specialist at Titan Pro in Clear Lake, where the workshop was hosted, said the biggest reason a farmer should think about a drone is it gives them control over when they spray.
Dodd said farmers also have the ability to tackle uneven terrains, seed a cover crop and perform multiple applications. To him, drone technology in ag is akin to his grandfather’s generation adding tractors on their farms.
“You know any farmers who … farm without a tractor?” Dodd said. “I really feel like if guys are apprehensive, they’re falling farther behind.”
 Disruption to the Chinese drone market could be imminent

Eric Ringer is the president of the American Spray Drone Coalition and vice president of partnerships for an Iowa City based spray drone retailer and software company.
Ringer said the nature of the spray drone industry is that the majority of the technology comes from China.
The American Spray Drone Coalition represents nearly 80% of the ag spray drone market in the country and has opposed some legislation that would restrict the sale of Chinese drones in the U.S.
Last year Congress considered, and ultimately passed, the National Defense Authorization Act, which among many things, stipulated the Chinese-owned drone company DJI join the Federal Communication Commission’s “covered list” unless a federal agency reviewed the company and determined it did not pose a threat to national security.
No agency has taken up the process to review the company and if none steps up by Dec. 23 of this year, DJI will join a slew of other Chinese companies on the covered list, and in essence be banned in the U.S.
According to the American Spray Drone Coalition, Chinese-made drones account for about 90% of the market in the U.S. Ringer said it was estimated that around 80% of spray drone flights in the U.S. were done with DJI equipment as of 2024.
“The reality is that the best drones on the market right now are from China,” Ringer said. “We need to do better, as a nation, in building up good domestic alternatives — but that doesn’t happen magically by banning all drones from a certain country.”
Ringer said the coalition advocates for consumer choice in the spray drone space and he said the coalition is supportive of legislation that can “curb dependency” on Chinese options without limiting options in the market.
“We advocate for basic farmer choice,” Ringer said. “We want there to be lots of options on the market so that our farmers benefit from all the good things about competition in technology suppliers.”
Ringer said more competition means downward pressure on price and upward pressure on quality.
According to data from the American Spray Drone Coalition, more than 10.3 million acres were treated via spray drones in 2024, which represented $215 million in rural revenue – not from purchasing drones but from operators offering custom applications and other such services with the drones.
U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York, penned a letter with other lawmakers urging the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to expedite a review of DJI and Autel to prevent the companies from defaulting to the covered list in December. No further action on this effort has been announced.
A DJI spokesperson wrote in an email the company has been “urging” the relevant agencies to conduct the audit required by Congress, and said the removal of DJI from the American market would have “devastating ramifications” on the U.S. economy.
“We made clear then – as we do now – that we welcome the opportunity to participate in a rigorous, transparent, and fair audit,” the spokesperson said. “We believe our products can stand up to scrutiny because our security protections and data privacy controls are real and robust.”
The spokesperson also said DJI has also received certifications and security audits from “industry experts and federal agencies.”
According to the spokesperson, DJI products, which stretch beyond the agricultural sector, generate “more than $116 billion in economic activity” in the U.S.
“America’s drone community deserves due process,” the statement said. “Today, thousands of farmers, first responders, small businesses, and others would be cut off from essential tools that enable them to operate safely, efficiently, and cost-effectively.”
Opponents of the Chinese drones fear the surveillance- and data-gathering capabilities of the drones pose a national security threat.
Ringer said if cybersecurity is a concern, then the focus should be on creating the same types of firewalls and security protections that are on foreign-made consumer electronics.
Ringer said U.S. options make up around 5% of all manufactured drones, not just ag drones, on the market. With such limited current capacity, he said legislation should urge U.S. drone manufacturers to focus on the “high sensitivity use cases” such as military drones and surveillance.
The National Defense Authorization Act is not the only threat to Chinese made drones.
Certain shipments of DJI drones have been stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, due to concerns of forced labor under the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. In a company blog post, DJI said the claims were “entirely unfounded and categorically false.”
In June, the U.S. House Appropriations Committee approved the Homeland Security budget for fiscal year 2026, which had a provision that would stop U.S. Customs and Border Protections from admitting “aerosol-dispensing unmanned aircraft system(s) produced or manufactured in a foreign adversary country.”
Ringer said this legislation, if approved by the House and Senate as is, would mean “our farmers are left hanging.”
Another federal bill, which Ringer said was a “good way” to go about the issue, has a longer timeline for a Chinese drone ban and it offers grants to domestic manufacturers as they ramp up production.
“The thing that we risk if we cut off our supply of drones today, is that the U.S. options are going to get rushed to market, because there’s a huge vacuum there, and we’re going to deal with quality issues,” Ringer said.
Ringer said the market has enough options right now that cutting off DJI won’t break it. But, he worries about the impacts to the market if all Chinese drones and components are banned.
 Texas-based ag drone company ready to step in

Hylio is a Texas-based drone and software company that was born out of a group of college engineering students who saw the potential of ag spray drones.
Currently, Hylio represents between 10%-15% of the U.S. spray drone market, and is the sole drone brand sold at Titan Pro in Clear Lake.
Hylio’s CEO Arthur Erickson said if DJI were banned in December, his company wouldn’t fill the gap immediately, “but it really wouldn’t take us long to catch up.” 
Part of that is because there are only a few thousand operators in the U.S. that use ag spray drones. Right now, Erickson said, Hylio can make about 2,000 drones a year, but will be up to 5,000-6,000 annually once they reach full capacity in three or four years.
Erickson said he and his cofounders were not thinking about the geopolitical divide when they founded the company, but as they realized the dominance Chinese brands had on the market, the American-made promise became more of the company’s “ethos.”
“It’s not that we’re against China or even DJI,” Erickson said. “It shouldn’t be the only monopolistic option on the market. There should be a lot of different choices.”
Erickson said the strategy to ban all Chinese drones could be a “rip the Band-aid off” method to force American drone companies to accelerate. This would increase demand for Hylio, but also encourage some of the younger U.S. manufacturers to become more competitive.
“It’s not going to be existential if there’s a somewhat limited supply of these spray drones over the next two or three years as these American companies scale up,” Erickson said. “(Farmers) are not going to go out of business just because they didn’t have spray drones for two or three years.”
But, he said, some of the risks might come to other sectors of the drone market, like firefighters and police officers who have used drones to locate missing people, as some agencies did following the recent flooding events in Texas.
Erickson said there are certain elements about Chinese owned drones that worry him, including reported funding ties to the Chinese Communist Party and what he called anticompetitive business practices.
“China’s doing what’s best for them, but we can’t just sit back and let them completely dominate this industry,” Erickson said. “… It would be an existential threat to let any single entity, Chinese or not, have that amount of control.”
Erickson said the bottom line is that “China is on the chopping block” and that it’s a “serious factor” for those purchasing drones to know that some Chinese models could be banned in a couple of months.
Maassen, the prospective buyer, said he was considering purchasing a Hylio drone for that very reason.
“DJI, XAG (another Chinese drone company) are going to be cheaper in the buy out – that’s the reality of it,” Maassen said. “Why would I want to buy that drone if I’m not going to be able to service it … it’s not exactly a smart plan on my part.”

(Leah Romero for Source NM)New Mexico’s congressional delegation, along with other members representing states eligible for compensation under the Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act, have asked U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi for a meeting to discuss implementation of the program.
The Aug. 14 letter acknowledges that the U.S. Department of Justice released new applications for RECA compensation following its inclusion and expansion in the July tax-and-spend bill signed by President Donald Trump, but asks U.S. DOJ to also release updated regulations.
‘The beginning of justice’

“For years we introduced legislation to expand RECA to cover all the communities harmed by our government’s nuclear testing program,” the letter reads. “We are glad that eight decades after the United States detonated the first atomic bomb in New Mexico and began to process uranium that poisoned many in St. Louis and elsewhere, the many diverse communities harmed by the nuclear testing program can finally apply for the compensation they deserve.”
The letter urges the agency to expedite updated RECA regulations, noting that “many survivors are already very ill, and with each passing week, more may die or be diagnosed.” The lawmakers also write that the agency should make payments available during the release of the interim rule, rather than wait for the final rule. The letter also specifies several actions the Department of Justice should take, including: hiring navigators to work directly with claimants; making information easily available to all claimants; holding informational sessions; remaining “flexible” about claimants’ documentation; and warning claimants about potential scams. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and RECA activists at the end of July issued a warning about such scams targeting claimants.
The new letter follows one sent by U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján and U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) sent in July to Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer also urging them to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short two-year timeline for compensation.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/vigil2-1024x683.png,,,2025-08-17 09:56:25.390398

He knows the drill: cut into the area behind the ears, find two small lymph nodes and incise them three or four times each. Check the nose and mouth for signs of disease — six to nine seconds to finish the inspection. Wash the gloves and sanitize the knives. One to two seconds to breathe.

For a year and seven months, Lopez performed procedures like this for 10 hours a day, five to six days a week. It’s what he was trained for as a consumer safety inspector at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).
“I would have my fingers start to lock up because I was gripping my knives too hard,” Lopez said. “Even though we kept ourselves at a high standard of being clean, I felt dirty, so I didn’t like to eat. It’s hard to stay hydrated, because if I had to take a drink, I had to take off my gloves, and I don’t have a lot of time to do that.”
At larger processing facilities, Lopez — who left his position in April — would help inspect thousands of animals a day for issues ranging from fecal matter to pathogens. The fast operation rates posed a challenge but were manageable, he said.
“I would say I had enough time,” Lopez said. “Did I have as much time as I wanted? No, absolutely not.”
Many swine and poultry plants across the U.S. are now increasing rates of processing and inspecting animals — or line speeds. The change is part of what government officials call a “modernized” inspection system, which also shifts carcass sorting duties from federal inspectors to company employees.

In March, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans to extend modernization waivers and to make faster line speeds a federal standard under President Trump’s second administration.
The move could permanently change the level of oversight FSIS inspectors have on the lines.
The USDA has said increasing line speeds will help companies meet growing demand without “excessive government interference,” according to a March release. Pork and poultry industry groups backed the announcement almost immediately, and one company official told Investigate Midwest that privatizing certain responsibilities allows for more in-house accountability during inspections.

However, critics of the change argue that federal inspectors play an essential role as independent watchdogs in privately run plants, and increasing line speeds with less federal oversight poses a significant risk to consumers, workers and animals.
“To put it simply, the plant will control every aspect of it with minimal oversight,” said Paula Soldner, national joint council chairperson of a FSIS inspectors’ union.
Shifts to modernization began in 1997 as FSIS permitted faster line speeds and fewer federal inspectors at a handful of swine and poultry slaughterhouses nationwide. In 2014, a new program began permitting poultry plants to modernize voluntarily, and an opt-in system for swine plants followed in 2019.
As of August, 168 poultry plants and 18 swine establishments have converted to modernized models. Waivers for two poultry facilities and four pork plants are currently pending.



At modernized poultry plants, line speed caps have risen from 140 to 175 birds per minute, and their swine counterparts face no line speed limits. All these establishments rely on their own employees to sort carcasses — the process of analyzing meat and trimming off defects — while government inspectors remain hands-off at the ends of the lines.
Though FSIS insists the modernized system keeps federal inspectors in charge, just with fewer physical responsibilities, The Washington Post reported in 2019 that inspection duties are shifting to private companies under modernization — if not on paper, then in practice.


At Wayne-Sanderson Farms, the nation’s third-largest poultry producer with over 26,000 employees, modernization efforts have led to a handoff of inspection responsibilities, according to Juanfra DeVillena, senior vice president of quality assurance and food safety. He confirmed company personnel have taken over initial inspection tasks and are now in charge of ensuring quality, while federal inspectors continue to oversee food safety.
“FSIS is food safety inspection, and they were getting into areas that did not belong to them,” DeVillena said. “What FSIS did is they just switched their focus to what they should have always done, which is food safety, and put the quality oversight back into our operations.”
In a statement to Investigate Midwest, a USDA spokesperson maintained that modernization is backed by “science and common sense.”
“These reforms allow for greater efficiency while strengthening U.S. food production, reducing costs for producers and consumers, and supporting a more resilient supply chain,” the government spokesperson wrote.
‘Some of them can be sneaky’: Inspectors warn of food safety risks

From August 2023 to last April, Lopez worked as an inspector on and off the processing lines at 16 pork, poultry, beef or bison plants in three states. Multiple were modernized facilities, he said, including Pitman Farms, a Utah turkey establishment.

There, company personnel sorted the carcasses, and as a federal inspector, Lopez observed their actions and screened every bird at the end of the line.
There were benefits to this hands-off role, he said, like being able to “sit there and actually look at product and not have to focus on sharpening our knives.” That’s part of how FSIS framed the change in its modernization policy: by removing inspectors from hands-on duties, the agency said they could devote more time to evaluating carcasses online and completing offline verification tasks “that are more effective in ensuring food safety.”
“Extensive research has confirmed that modernized systems uphold the highest food safety standards,” the USDA spokesperson wrote to Investigate Midwest.
But under the poultry modernization program, only one federal inspector is stationed on each processing line, responsible for reviewing all carcasses sorted by plant employees. And problems arose for Lopez when the workers he oversaw consistently outnumbered him five to one.
“Yes, we’re there, and we have the potential to see everything that’s going on, but in reality, it doesn’t always work out that way,” Lopez said. “You can’t look at five people and watch everything that they’re doing as well as pay attention to what you’re inspecting.”
To Lopez, the success of a plant’s modernization depends on staffing levels. If line speeds increase, so should the number of plant workers and federal inspectors to maintain food safety standards, he said.
A USDA spokesperson did not address questions from Investigate Midwest about how the agency enforces federal staffing standards at traditional plants, and how these regulations differ at modernized plants.
Soldner, of the FSIS inspectors’ union, has visited several modernized slaughterhouses over the past few years. She said she noticed no glaring food safety concerns because all the facilities were “adequately staffed.”
But even sufficient staffing may not be enough. According to Lopez, FSIS requires its inspectors to undergo “intensive” training prior to certification, where food safety is highlighted as the top priority. At the modernized plants where Lopez worked, he said private employees tasked with carcass sorting went through similar training, though he believes it was not nearly as rigorous.
FSIS does not mandate any standardized training for company sorters. The agency instead encourages companies to conduct independent training based on federal guidelines for both pork and poultry, which are derived from FSIS inspector training protocols.
At Wayne-Sanderson Farms, DeVillena said privately-hired sorters undergo annual recertifications using an internal training manual developed from federal guidelines. The training includes classroom lectures, on-the-job training, follow-up sessions and continuous monitoring.
“I honestly don’t know the frequency in which the FSIS inspectors get trained, but I can tell you that for our group, it’s more strict because we own that process,” DeVillena said. “We gotta be able to defend it and validate it.”
But Wayne-Sanderson’s approach is not industry standard — or federally mandated. Critics say that flexibility is the problem. Without enforceable, uniform training requirements, each company can decide how thoroughly its workers are prepared to identify contamination and disease.
In public comments on the 2019 swine modernization policy, several advocacy groups urged FSIS to establish official training for company sorters. Even industry members requested that the agency improve existing training guidelines.
FSIS responded that its current guide was sufficient, and it would not be “prescribing specific sorter training or certification.” When Investigate Midwest asked why, the agency did not respond.
Adequate training only goes so far, Lopez said. In his experience, even if carcass sorters were well-trained, their priorities as private personnel may have leaned toward keeping the lines moving.
“Some of them can be sneaky about what they do,” Lopez said. In instances where he flagged a carcass for contamination but didn’t immediately take control of it, he said employees would sometimes make the contamination “mysteriously disappear” or mix the carcass in with others. “They might do it in the name of efficiency, but not necessarily in the name of food safety,” he added.
In response to Lopez’s experiences at modernized plants, DeVillena said the structure of modernized inspection systems at Wayne-Sanderson Farms makes it “impossible” to hide defects.
“Even if we wanted to do that, which we don’t want to, there’s no way for us to do that,” DeVillena said.

DeVillena described two levels of FSIS oversight at his company: a carcass inspector stationed at the end of the line to catch external contamination like fecal matter, and a verification inspector who examines 10 carcasses in detail each hour, including internal checks, to make sure company employees do their jobs effectively. He emphasized that the latter inspector can open the carcasses, examine every surface and is not directly supervising the sorters’ work — but still has full access to verify product safety.
However, other inspectors have described experiences similar to those of Lopez. In April 2020, Jill Mauer, a federal consumer safety inspector, filed a declaration as part of a 2019 lawsuit against the USDA over its swine modernization policy. In it, Mauer said she’d been working at a modernized pork plant in Austin, Minnesota, for 23 years prior.
“I have witnessed slaughterhouse employees attempt to sneak defective carcasses past me,” her declaration stated. Diseased animals and defects like “toenails, hair, and abscesses are routinely allowed for human consumption” at the facility, Mauer wrote.
Part of the problem, she said, was the short inspection time. At the modernized plant in Minnesota, “inspectors have about two seconds per pig to identify pathology and fecal contamination,” Mauer stated. Investigate Midwest reached out to her for comment, but she declined to speak on the record.
Soldner, who worked as a FSIS inspector for 32 years prior to her full-time role at the inspectors’ union, said this window wasn’t nearly enough time for federal inspectors to spot hazards — even if private employees had already reviewed the carcasses.
The shrinking role of inspectors on pork and poultry lines reflect a fundamental shift in oversight, she said.
“When I came in in 1987, we regulated the industry,” Soldner told Investigate Midwest. “Now, industry regulates what FSIS inspectors have the ability to do.”
Industry groups defend modernization 
Pork and poultry industries claim faster line speeds do not make food any less safe.
When the USDA announced its plans to formally increase line speeds in March, the National Chicken Council, a trade association representing U.S. chicken companies, voiced its support. In a March 17 release, the Council cited a 2021 study concluding that faster line speeds do not predict higher salmonella contamination risk in young chicken processing plants.
In a statement to Investigate Midwest, Tom Super, the Council’s senior vice president of public affairs, emphasized that modernization in poultry processing applies only to the speed of evisceration lines — the “highly automated” areas that involve organ removal, carcass cleaning and inspection.
“Food safety outcomes are not determined by the speed of the evisceration line,” Super wrote. Instead, he said, they depend on maintaining strict protocols, using science-backed safety measures and ensuring consistent oversight.
Investigate Midwest reached out to several other modernized swine and poultry companies for comment about faster line speeds and the reorganization of federal inspectors. None responded to multiple requests for comment.
For years, industry groups have lobbied for faster line speeds, records show.
In 2017, the National Chicken Council petitioned the government to permit faster line speeds in young chicken slaughterhouses. Shortly after, multiple trade associations and corporations shared nearly identical letters of support.
In the letters, industry groups — including the Ohio Poultry Association, the Indiana State Poultry Association, Wayne-Sanderson Farms (then Wayne Farms) and House of Raeford Farms — celebrated the petition as a step forward in “promoting and enhancing FSIS inspection procedures” and “increasing industry efficiency.”
Industry members wrote that they believe modernization would maintain food safety, citing a 2017 federal report that found no increase in salmonella contamination at modernized poultry plants.
“The data also demonstrated that inspectors are performing four times more off-line food safety verification tasks” in modernized plants than in their traditional counterparts, the letters stated.
In one letter, House of Raeford Farms — one of the top poultry producers nationwide — highlighted the “competitive disadvantage” of line speed caps. Plants in other countries like Canada operate at higher line speeds, the company wrote, so eliminating domestic line speed limits would “put U.S. producers on more equal footing.”



FSIS ultimately denied the National Chicken Council’s petition in January 2018, but said it intended to allow faster line speeds at young chicken plants that follow certain criteria “in the near future.” A month later, the agency published that criteria, permitting certain facilities to increase line speeds.
Now, under Trump’s second administration, faster line speeds are on track to become the new federal standard for both pork and poultry.
For plants with high daily outputs, Lopez, the former FSIS inspector, said that faster lines and shifting federal oversight could lead to food safety risks. But he sees potential in modernized systems, he said, especially at facilities that maintain sufficient staff and don’t overwhelm them with thousands of animals a day.


“I think that some of the medium-sized establishments really could benefit from it,” Lopez said. “The large establishments just kind of take advantage of it.”
Is speed or staffing to blame for increased worker injury? 
Data shows that meatpacking and poultry companies are among the most dangerous industries in America.
Two government-commissioned studies published in January found that 81% of workers at evaluated poultry facilities and 46% of workers at evaluated swine plants were at high risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) like carpal tunnel syndrome.
PULSE_PoultryStudy_250109_Final
Many workers and advocates say faster line speeds increase risk of injury. Jose Oliva — campaigns director at HEAL Food Alliance, a coalition of food and farm system workers — called the change a “total travesty” for plant employees. Prior to HEAL, Oliva served as director of the Food Chain Workers Alliance, which represents hundreds of thousands of workers in the food system.
“Even though you are wearing protective equipment, that does not give you 100% protection,” Oliva said. “If (workers are) injured or cut themselves, if the injury is not too deep, they just continue to work. The line just keeps moving.”
A policy brief from Johns Hopkins University supports this conclusion, according to Patti Truant Anderson, the brief’s author.
“What we found in our review of literature was that there’s strong evidence that line speeds are associated with higher worker perceptions of injury risk, so they feel like it’s more unsafe when they’re made to work at these higher line speeds,” said Anderson, who is policy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. Her analysis also found that line speeds are associated with “lower worker well-being and higher injury risk from repetitive tasks,” she said.
Several reports by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, highlight these concerns. The assessments, published between 2005 and 2017, repeatedly note stakeholder concerns about worker safety with faster line speeds. When asked if GAO is investigating modernization in light of Rollins’ recent announcement, public affairs specialist Jasmine Berry Franklin told Investigate Midwest the agency has “nothing currently in the works.”

The National Chicken Council, however, points to results from the January study on poultry workers, which suggest no associations between evisceration line speeds and MSD risk. The identical study on swine workers found conflicting evidence: faster evisceration lines were linked to an increase in MSD risk at one facility, and a decrease at another.
In the statement to Investigate Midwest, the USDA spokesperson cited the same studies, concluding “no direct link between line speeds and workplace injuries.” The agency’s March 17 announcement to formalize faster line speeds also halted any further collection of worker safety data from modernized plants, calling the information “redundant.”
According to Carisa Harris — principal investigator of both studies and director of the Northern California Center of Occupational and Environmental Health — evisceration line speeds aren’t the main determinant of worker safety.
Instead, she said, the critical metric is piece rate: the number of animal parts handled per minute by each individual worker. While evisceration line speeds measure the speed at which the lines move in one stage of processing, piece rate takes into account both line speeds and staffing levels to determine the individual workload of each employee throughout the entire process.
Both studies found a correlation between MSD risk and piece rate.
swine processing line speed study
“There’s been so much attention on evisceration line speed, and our hope is that the conversation changes because that’s not the variable that’s going to help protect workers,” Harris said. “If we can talk about piece rate by area or by job, that would be a much more productive conversation to have.”
The two studies weren’t without limitations. One, as Harris called it, was “healthy worker survivor bias” — the tendency for results to reflect only workers healthy enough to continue on.
“Those who left employment due to work-related pain or the inability to keep up with the high pace of work were underrepresented,” the poultry report stated. The swine study echoed this limitation.
Debbie Berkowitz, who served as chief of staff at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from 2009 to 2014, said she believes evaluated plants may have also added staff during the study period to reduce individual workloads while under observation.
“Because (the plants) knew they were being studied, they added workers to jobs, which meant that nobody was working harder and faster in the key jobs that they studied,” Berkowitz told Investigate Midwest.

The USDA spokesperson did not respond to a question about this phenomenon, but Harris acknowledged it was a concern — that plants may have temporarily improved working conditions during the study. However, she said her team regularly interviewed workers to assess whether the conditions they experienced during the studies matched their usual work environments. According to Harris, “very few” reported any differences.
Lori Stevermer, a Minnesota pork producer and immediate past president of the National Pork Producers Council, reiterated that “increased line speeds are not a leading factor in worker safety” in a statement to Investigate Midwest.
Super, of the National Chicken Council, said unsafe line speeds would be counterproductive for the industry itself.
“If line speeds are set too fast, then tasks will not be performed properly and the result will be a costly de-valuing of the final poultry products,” Super wrote in the statement. “No benefit exists for plant management to operate production lines at speeds that are unsafe, and will not permit all work to be performed at high levels of skill and competence.”
Where efficiency meets animal welfare 
Slaughterhouse operations are systematic. Animals undergo a step-by-step process that stuns, scalds, removes organs, washes, cuts and chills in a highly efficient fashion.
However, protocol can go awry for a variety of reasons, ranging from worker error to machinery malfunction. And animal welfare advocates allege that it has, especially at modernized swine and poultry plants with increasing line speeds and shifting federal oversight.

Delcianna Winders, director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at the Vermont Law and Graduate School, said faster line speeds result in more inhumane practices.
“Animals who are not keeping pace with the line are handled violently by workers who are just trying to keep up,” Winders told Investigate Midwest. This involves “increased dragging of animals, hitting of animals and excessive electroshocking” leading up to slaughter, she said.
Concerns like these helped fuel a 2019 lawsuit filed by Winders and a group of animal welfare organizations, challenging the USDA’s swine modernization program. The lawsuit alleged, among other claims, that increasing line speeds and shifting responsibility from federal inspectors to slaughterhouse employees jeopardize humane handling.
“Even downed pigs — animals too sick or injured to walk — were handled in this way, because, according to a supervisor, they ‘don’t have time’ to handle them more humanely,” the lawsuit stated.
As part of the court case, advocates and inspectors submitted a series of declarations about personal experiences with modernization. One testimony came from Mauer, the consumer safety inspector who raised food safety concerns about her modernized pork plant in Austin, Minnesota.
Mauer wrote that on multiple occasions, she noticed pig carcasses with water-filled lungs from the scald tank — a stage in the slaughter process where animals should be dead.
“While there are a few reasons why tank water in the lungs may occur, tank water in hogs’ lungs is an indication that pigs were possibly still breathing at the time they entered the scalding tank,” her declaration stated.
Improper execution at slaughterhouses isn’t a new complaint. In 2013, the Washington Post reported that nearly 1 million birds were boiled alive in U.S. poultry plants every year, based on USDA data. This was in part due to rapid line speeds, which can result in unsuccessful slaughter prior to scald tank immersion, the article found.
But Super, of the National Chicken Council, maintained that modernization only changes the speeds of postmortem evisceration lines. Leading up to and during slaughter, Super said, chicken processors consider animal welfare “the top priority,” and they “strictly adhere” to federal guidelines for humane handling.



Advocates remain critical. Michael Windsor — senior corporate engagement director at The Humane League, a nonprofit working to end farmed animal abuse — told Investigate Midwest in a statement that faster line speeds in any stage of processing add pressure to the entire system.
“Any increase in line speeds — pre- or post-mortem — create a dangerous ripple effect that increases suffering for animals and hazards for workers,” Windsor stated.
He added that consumers likely have a “limited sense” of what goes on behind closed doors at modernized plants.


“When people think about food safety or animal welfare, they don’t necessarily picture the exhausted workers racing to keep pace with hundreds of birds per minute or the animals being improperly stunned and boiled alive,” Windsor wrote. “This lack of awareness isn’t accidental. The meat industry operates in secrecy, and USDA policies — like allowing company employees to replace federal inspectors — only deepen the opacity.”
Four years after the 2019 lawsuit, the judge dismissed the case and upheld the federal swine modernization program. In a December 2023 ruling, the court found that FSIS had adequately considered humane handling impacts, which was all the law required.
Winders said she believes courts generally defer to the judgment of administration agencies like the USDA.
“It’s very hard to prevail against an agency because everything is going to be interpreted in their favor,” she said.
Winders and her team stand firm on one claim, arguing modernization reduces federal oversight and endangers animal welfare. They’ve appealed the ruling, and an oral argument is approaching in the next few months. With formal laws on the horizon, Winders said issues surrounding modernization are only growing more critical — not just due to risks to animals, but also to workers and consumers.
“It’s hard to disentangle the animal welfare concerns and human safety concerns,” she told Investigate Midwest. “They’re really intertwined.”

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
Statehouse Democrats want to use Trump’s big bill to drag down Republicans

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Medicaid cuts are likely to worsen mental health care in rural America

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.
 










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw




New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.

Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”

GOP pressure

Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.

Unreliable data?

But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

As a small, rural state, Vermont is especially vulnerable to any shifts in federal support.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Mike Pieciak and Sue Minter: How Vermonters can prepare for a future with less federal support.","This commentary is by Mike Pieciak and Sue Minter. Pieciak is the Vermont state treasurer and Minter previously served as executive director of Capstone Community Action, secretary of the Vermont Department of Transportation, state representative and state director of recovery after Tropical Storm Irene. The Task Force on the Federal Transition was convened by Pieciak and co-chaired by Minter.


Vermonters have learned a hard lesson from past disasters: Being prepared makes a difference.
The Covid-19 pandemic, Tropical Storm Irene and devastating floods of recent summers have shown that when we plan ahead and protect our state, we keep Vermonters safe, businesses open and costs down. Today, we must use this same approach as the Trump administration threatens the security of workers, families and our communities.
Vermonters are already feeling the impact of the MAGA agenda. Inflation is worsening, tariffs are driving up costs for businesses, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are tearing families apart, and important programs like Medicaid and food assistance are being slashed. The stock market may be riding high, but this bears little resemblance to the reality of most Vermonters. 
Across our state, there is deep anxiety about how President Donald Trump’s policies are affecting our neighbors, the cost of living and the most vulnerable among us. To better understand the impact of these changes as they unfold — and develop recommendations to protect Vermonters from incoming and future changes — the State Treasurer’s Office convened the Task Force on the Federal Transition.
Meeting regularly since January, the task force included a range of local leaders and heard from local and national experts about how federal changes are impacting Vermonters, our economy and the state’s fiscal health. 
As a small, rural state, Vermont is especially vulnerable to any shifts in federal support. On a per capita basis, Vermont receives about 36% more federal funding than the average U.S. state. Federal funds, meanwhile, account for roughly 35% of our state budget. 
Over the past decade, Vermont has also been the fourth-highest recipient per capita among all U.S. states of disaster-related federal funding. With the role of the Federal Emergency Management Agency now in question, any loss in disaster-related support would shift more costs to states, businesses and taxpayers.
In our communities, ICE raids and changes to immigration policy have stirred needless terror and dislocated neighbors and family members. This has also added pressure to Vermont’s already strained workforce, driving up costs in critical industries like health care, agriculture and housing.
At our northern border, Trump’s rhetoric and tariffs are dramatically impacting Canadian travel to Vermont. In March, April and May, year-over-year private-vehicle crossings from Canada into Vermont were down about 35%. This sudden drop in Canadian visitors is hurting our state’s $4 billion tourism industry, which many of our rural communities rely on. 
When Washington, D.C., changes course or tone, Vermonters feel it here at home.
Recently, the task force published a final report with 11 recommended actions to make Vermont’s economy more resilient to federal policy changes. The recommendations include creating a state natural disaster recovery reserve, convening nonprofit leaders to strengthen services, and establishing a state office of new Americans to coordinate resources for foreign newcomers and help grow our workforce and economy. 
Across all recommendations, the report delivers a clear message: Vermont must prepare now for a future with fewer federal dollars, greater economic uncertainty, and higher costs for workers and families. 
We cannot control what is going to happen in Washington, D.C., and we cannot fully replace the federal support that is being cut away. But we can organize, plan ahead and take proactive steps to provide the best outcomes possible to Vermonters.
This work takes on even greater importance under Trump’s domestic policy bill, which was passed after the work of the task force was completed. In the coming years, cuts and new requirements to programs like Medicaid and SNAP will kick tens of thousands of Vermonters off their health insurance and cause children across the state to go hungry. 
This will trap more families in poverty, strain social services and drive up costs for everyone. It’s a historic betrayal of the working and middle class.
Recognizing these challenges, we must lean into our strengths as Vermonters: strong communities, a deep care for our neighbors and a shared commitment to protecting the place we call home. We must work together and prove once again that when we stand shoulder to shoulder, we can build a better future for everyone. 
That won’t change — no matter what happens in Washington, D.C.

After Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent a Cuban man to a detention facility in Tacoma, Washington, from Miami, he gave up fighting his case.
The Cuban man and others still in immigration custody asked not to be identified because of retaliation concerns.
The man said he had a lawyer in Miami, but a judge hearing his case at Northwest ICE Processing Center told him that the lawyer would have to come to Tacoma. The man and his partner didn’t have the money to pay for the attorney’s travel, so he asked to be deported.
Months later, he is still in ICE custody with no end in sight.
“I can’t stand this anymore,” the Cuban man said in Spanish. “It’s a lot of suffering.”
He is among many who are in custody and have waited months to be deported after agreeing, often under pressure from ICE, to deportation. Capital & Main spoke with people from many countries, including India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mexico, in addition to Cuba, who said they had waited months in detention centers for deportation.
ICE did not respond to a request for comment from Capital & Main.
The man and other Cubans at Northwest ICE Processing Center, a facility owned and operated by private prison company GEO Group, told Capital & Main that ICE said they would be detained indefinitely because they can’t be deported. They said both Cuba and Mexico have refused to take them.
“I don’t know what they will do with us,” the Cuban man said. “If they can’t send me to any country, and my country won’t accept me, they have to set me free.”
According to immigration attorney Ginger Jacobs, deportations often take months.
When ICE deports people by plane, the agency either charters a flight to send a group of deportees to a specific country or region, or it sends the person with guards on a commercial flight.
ICE chartered 207 planes to deport people in July, according to a report from Witness at the Border, which monitors both domestic and international ICE flights. About 60% of those flights went to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Cuba received one flight.
Deportation requires cooperation and negotiation between the U.S. and the receiving country. The receiving country has to confirm the citizenship of the person in question and provide travel documents. Some countries refuse to take back deportees.
In a 2001 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that detaining someone indefinitely in immigration custody is unconstitutional. As a result, people who are waiting for deportation can request to be released from custody six months after judges ordered them deported.
Some detainees at Northwest ICE Processing Center said they’re worried that, based on conversations they had with ICE officers, the agency is transferring people between facilities and restarting the six-month countdown. But since none of those detainees have yet reached the six-month mark, they were unable to verify what ICE officers had told them.
Jacobs, the immigration attorney, said it doesn’t matter which detention center someone is in. The six-month countdown begins when someone in custody receives a deportation order if there is no pending appeal.
But to the detainees interviewed by Capital & Main, the wait feels indefinite.
“When you know that you did something wrong and you’re in jail, that’s something different, but doing time without a release date, that’s like a torture, and that’s what we’re doing here,” said a man from India who has been in custody for over two years.
He said his case was on appeal at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but he gave up so that he could leave to get treatment for a tumor behind his ear and because he felt he had already spent too much time away from his young children. His family plans to join him in India after his deportation.
The man said he asked a supervisor about the delay and learned that the officer who was supposed to be working on his deportation documents had been on vacation for weeks. He told Capital & Main that he was still waiting to have his picture taken and start the process for his travel documents. He said ICE told him it would take another six or seven months to deport him.
“There’s a lot of people who want to leave, but I think they want to set an example like this is how we’re going to torture you guys,” he said.
A man from Ecuador detained at Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego asked a judge to deport him about a month ago. He’s still in custody.
“They just say have patience, have patience,” he said in Spanish.
He said the treatment at the facility makes him feel depressed and made him decide to leave. He said the facility is overcrowded and that guards yell often at the people in custody.
Ryan Gustin, spokesperson for CoreCivic, the private prison company that owns and operates Otay Mesa Detention Center, said that detainees have access to a grievance process to express concerns about guards’ behavior. Gustin said ICE monitors the facility to ensure compliance with the agency’s detention standards.
When asked about overcrowding concerns, Gustin said everyone detained there “is offered a bed.”
Some of the men waiting to be deported believed that ICE had bungled their deportations.
One said he’d been waiting about two and a half months for ICE to deport him to his home country of Mexico. Usually, deportations to Mexico happen quickly.
“They don’t come often, and they don’t give answers, just whatever excuse,” the man from Mexico said in Spanish about ICE officers. “Last time they told me I was lost in the system.”
Kulimba Nyembo, who gave Capital & Main permission to use his full name, said he’d already been waiting at the Tacoma facility for about six months for deportation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo when he spoke to Capital & Main in June.
He said he had a deportation order from mid-December, and he had provided his travel documents to the deportation officer.
“Every single document that needs to be brought in has already been brought in,” he said. “Either it’s a money game situation where they’re farming me for more money on my head every month, or they know I have all my documents in order and I become less of a priority because it’s like we’ll get to you when we get to you. Now I’m spending every day here for absolutely nothing.”
Nyembo said he’d grown up in the U.S., and an assault charge landed him in prison. When he finished serving his sentence in early 2024, he rebuilt his life, he said, and didn’t get into any more trouble. But ICE arrested him in December, and Nyembo decided not to fight the case.
He said officers tried to deport him in May, but the guards who were supposed to escort him didn’t have the right visas.
“Everything that has prolonged my stay here has nothing to do with me,” Nyembo said. “It has to do with someone not being efficient enough or proficient enough in their work.”
At the time of publication, Nyembo no longer showed up in an ICE database that tracks people in the agency’s custody.
Meanwhile, the Cuban man’s partner, who is a U.S. citizen, said she hasn’t seen him since last year, when ICE arrested him while he was waiting for her to do laundry.
She said she is struggling to pay rent, send money for him to call her and take care of their son by herself. She sold many of their belongings to try to pay for his attorney. She said she takes as much overtime work as she can get to try to make ends meet.
The partner and mother said she is exhausted.
“Sometimes I only have $1 in my account,” she said in Spanish. “I sit in my bed and cry.”
She said both she and her partner are afraid to go to Cuba because of the political and economic situation there, but that if he gets deported, she will go wherever the U.S. sends him. The most important thing, she said, is for them to be able to be together as a family.
“Why don’t they let him out already?” she said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Election years call for politicians to do some tricky maneuvering. While an elected official will present a new initiative as a way to help constituents, opponents are likely to label it as a cynical attempt to curry favor with voters. 
That’s where Gov. Larry Rhoden finds himself right now after the announcement of Operation Prairie Thunder. It commits the National Guard, Highway Patrol and Corrections Department to support federal immigration enforcement, and commits state troopers to saturation patrols in Sioux Falls. 
National Guard soldiers will help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement with administrative tasks, Highway Patrol troopers will do immigration enforcement during the regular course of their work, and Corrections Department personnel will coordinate with ICE to deport inmates in state custody who entered the country illegally. 
Race for South Dakota governor could be a race for Trump’s favor

Critics of the program have complained that Rhoden is using state resources to further his own political ambitions, even though the governor has not revealed whether he will seek election to the office he gained when Kristi Noem joined President Donald Trump’s Cabinet.
“While I agree that we need to hold criminals accountable and be tough on crime, this goes too far,” said Sen. Liz Larson, a Democrat from Sioux Falls. 
If Democrats think Prairie Thunder is Rhoden’s first attempt to use his office for political gain, they’re late with their criticism. 
Since mid-March, the governor has been running a shadow reelection campaign through his Open for Opportunity Tour. 
Rhoden introduced that initiative as a continuation of Noem’s Open for Business program. According to a news release from the governor’s office, “The Open for Opportunity Tour will feature Governor Rhoden visiting communities across South Dakota to highlight their economic development efforts, learn their specific needs, and work together to chase down opportunities.”
In effect, Rhoden stepped into office and onto the campaign trail. The Open for Opportunity Tour is introducing business leaders to their new governor. It is also introducing the new governor to an ever-growing group of potential political donors. 
An unscientific search of state news releases found that since March 17 Rhoden has made 17 Open for Opportunity trips to 25 communities. From Sioux Falls to the Standing Rock Reservation, from Mud Butte to Mitchell, from Box Elder to Huron, Rhoden is getting to know the business leaders in each community as well as fattening his Rolodex. 
On one hand, it’s refreshing to have a governor who is more interested in traveling in the state than out-of-state. Of course all of these trips are state funded, your tax dollars at work as Rhoden scores some political points. 
The irony here is that for all Rhoden’s work currying favor with business leaders, Prairie Thunder will likely alienate some of them. Pledging to round up illegal aliens will make it tougher to fill those jobs that only immigrants are willing to tackle. 
While South Dakota is Open for Opportunity, one of those opportunities has been for Rhoden to run a political campaign using state funds. In essence, the governor is using an office he wasn’t elected to as a means to jumpstart a campaign he hasn’t announced yet. Now that’s quite an opportunity.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Self-driving vehicle technology continues to advance, prompting a wave of liability and safety regulations from state lawmakers.
This year, lawmakers in Arizona, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada and the District of Columbia enacted legislation to regulate driverless vehicles, according to a database from the National Conference of State Legislatures.
While much of the legislation aims to update existing law to include new definitions for autonomous vehicles, other measures put rules in place regarding insurance, permitting, licensing and road testing.
In total, lawmakers in 25 states introduced 67 bills related to autonomous vehicles, according to the database. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania currently have bills under consideration. Alaska, Delaware and Washington have bills that will be carried over into the next legislative session.
Governors vetoed two measures this year. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis shot down a measure that would have required a driver to be present in any commercial vehicle being operated by an automated driving system.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a measure that would have put rules in place for “high-risk artificial intelligence systems,” but would have excluded “autonomous vehicle technology” from that category.
As of now, there are no vehicles that have achieved full autonomy, according to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ criteria. But several car companies have introduced automated driving features, allowing drivers to take their hands off the wheel.
Tesla is rolling out its Full Self-Driving feature, a system under which a vehicle can drive itself almost anywhere with minimal intervention from the driver. Tesla Autopilot, which the company made available to the public in late 2024, also helps with basic vehicle maneuvering.
And Waymo, the country’s first autonomous ride-hailing service, is currently operating in Atlanta; Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Phoenix and San Francisco. The robo-taxi company plans to expand to Miami and Washington, D.C., next.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, vehicle safety is the main benefit of driverless cars. With higher levels of automation, there is less room for human error or driver distractions. The new technology also could improve safety for bicyclists and pedestrians, according to the agency.
But driverless cars have been involved in hundreds of accidents over the past few years. Between 2021 and 2024, there were 696 accidents reported that involved a Waymo vehicle, according to an analysis by California-based law firm DiMarco | Araujo | Montevideo.
And last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began investigating Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after multiple reports of crashes that occurred in low-visibility conditions.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-17 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"While redistricting battles could wage across country, there’s no fight left in Mississippi",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/17/redistricting-battles-trump-house/,Column: Don’t look for Mississippi to get involved in what appears to be an escalating redistricting war where states redraw their U.S. House districts to aid Republicans or Democrats ahead of a hotly contested 2026 national election.,"Don’t look for Mississippi to get involved in what appears to be an escalating redistricting war where states redraw their U.S. House districts to aid Republicans or Democrats ahead of a hotly contested 2026 national election.
Mississippi most likely will not engage in the redistricting battle because Republicans already have been helped about as much as possible in the Magnolia State. Here, there are three safe Republican U.S. House districts and one safe Democratic district.
In theory, the Mississippi Legislature could draw the congressional districts in such a manner as to make all four districts favor Republicans. But to do so, Black voters, who generally are more prone to vote Democratic, would have to be diluted to such an extent that the redraw would conflict with long-held federal court rulings.
From a legal standpoint and even from an ethical and moral standpoint, it would be difficult to justify no Black-majority districts in Mississippi, where the non-white population is nearing 40%.
Unsurprisingly, Texas fired the first shot in what is shaping up as a nationwide redistricting battle. The Texas Legislature, at the behest of President Donald Trump, who fears his Republican Party will lose the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm election, is trying to redraw the Longhorn State’s 38 congressional districts to give the Republicans five more seats. They currently have 25.
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom is threatening to retaliate by creating more Democratic districts. California currently has 43 Democratic districts and nine Republican districts.
There have been rumblings of blue New York and red Florida also going back to the redistricting drawing board to create more seats to help their respective party.
Normally, redistricting is conducted every 10 years after the release of the U.S. Census. The last redistricting occurred after the 2020 U.S. Census. But it should be no surprise that Trump, fearing that Republicans will lose the House in 2026, asked Texas to eschew the norms and conduct a mid-decade redistricting.
Both Democrats and Republicans are guilty of gerrymandering or of drawing districts to benefit their political party. The courts, generally, have said that is OK.
But the courts — at least in the past — have also said their minority populations must be given opportunities to elect candidates of their choice.
While the courts have said gerrymandering is allowed, a recent Economist/YouGov poll found an overwhelming 69% oppose the partisan drawing of districts, compared to only 9% who support it and 22% of respondents who are unsure. A plurality of 35% support states retaliating if another state draws districts to support one particular party. The retaliation is opposed by 30%, while 36% of respondents are unsure.
A plurality also opposes Trump’s call for the FBI to hunt down Texas Democratic lawmakers who have fled the state to prevent the Legislature from having the quorum needed to draw new congressional districts.
For what it’s worth, a study by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project found 15 states with failing grades in terms of non-partisan redistricting. Nine of those states failed because of their strong Republican tilt, while five failed because of strong Democratic leanings. Two — Tennessee and Louisiana — failed because of racial unfairness. Through court rulings, a new Black-majority district has been created in Louisiana since the Princeton study was conducted.
Texas and Florida were among the states receiving failing grades. New York and California were not. Another large Democratic stronghold, Illinois, did get a failing grade.
Mississippi is unique because of its racial makeup and voting patterns. Most white Mississippians vote Republican, but the large Black minority — the largest percentage of Black voters in the nation — tends to vote Democratic.
While Republicans have won all statewide elections since 2016, the elections often are relatively close.
In the latest redistricting, Democrats argued that because of the strong pro-Democratic minority population, one of the three heavily Republican congressional districts should be drawn in a manner to make it more competitive.
But the majority-Republican Legislature rejected that argument. Hence, there is no need for the Republicans in the Mississippi Legislature to undertake redistricting now.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06172904/AP_21349657014068-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-17 07:56:29.514089

This story by Cheryl Casey was first published in the Waterbury Roundabout on Aug. 12, 2025.
Plans for the historic 150-year-old Goodell House at Little River State Park to be used as a trailside rental cabin are moving closer to reality: The project is now officially part of the state forestry plan, with a nonprofit gearing up to take on the work in 2026.
The 1860s structure on Ricker Mountain has been approved for relocation and preservation in the state’s forest management plan, which was amended to include the project this spring. In March, the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation revised the Mt. Mansfield State Forest Long Range Management Plan to include the preservation of the last remaining structure from the once-thriving mill and farm community near the Little River. The state has partnered with the nonprofit Vermont Huts & Trails to relocate, restore and maintain the Goodell House as part of its network of rustic, remote trail accommodations for public use. 
“This partnership expands access to state lands while preserving the distinct character of one of the original historic structures in the Ricker Basin,” said Forests, Parks and Recreation Commissioner Danielle Fitzko.
The state collected public input last year about the future of the Goodell House as an important piece of community history and an opportunity to expand recreation at the state park. Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore signed off on the update to the forest management plan in March. It now allows for “the relocation and rehabilitation of the Goodell House as a four-season hut” to be enjoyed as “an overnight resource for a diverse group of users.”
Vermont Huts & Trails Executive Director RJ Thompson said the project will give the historic house a new life that connects its history to modern times and visitors. “This is a great opportunity to preserve history and enhance recreation and access to an area of Mt. Mansfield State Forest with a mix of hiking, biking, and Nordic skiing options,” Thompson said. 
Located along the Dalley Loop trail in Little River State Park’s History Hike, the Goodell House will be moved 600 feet downhill to a gravel pit that is better situated to meet accessibility goals and minimize environmental impacts. Project planners from the state and the huts organization have been working closely with the state’s Division of Historic Preservation to ensure the building’s historic character is preserved. 
“This is almost seven-plus years in the making,” said Dani Kehlmann, development director for Vermont Huts & Trails. “It’s a cool way to preserve local history and increase access that folks have to (Little River State) park.”

The two-story 20’ x 25’ colonial home was built of hand-hewn timber beams and cedar shingles by Almeron Goodell after he purchased 14 acres on Ricker Mountain in 1863. Joined by his wife Lutheria and their two children, Goodell finished the house in 1870. A 12’ x 12’ addition was added to the footprint later. For 36 years, the Goodells were subsistence farmers, eking out a hardscrabble life alongside the farmers, loggers and sawmill workers who had settled in the Little River basin. Timber was the primary industry in the area. 
After Lutheria’s death, Goodell sold the house and moved to Hyde Park in 1906. The Ricker Mountain community, which had been there for nearly 130 years, had started to dwindle and deteriorate by that time. The last of the settlement was finally swallowed by the Waterbury Reservoir in the late 1930s after dam construction was completed. 
On higher ground, the house held out long after other structures collapsed and were overtaken by forest, likely helped along by several local families who used the structure as a hunting camp until the 1970s. Today the fragile Goodell House stands as a reminder of the industrious community that shaped a significant part of Waterbury’s early history. It won’t stand for much longer, however, without intervention and the state’s collaboration with Vermont Huts & Trails is intended to avoid this loss.
According to Kehlmann and stewardship forester Brad Greenough, the project to move and rehabilitate the house on its new site is scheduled for spring 2026. The goal is for it to be ready to welcome overnight guests by the end of next year, they said.

The plan for the house that the state and Vermont Huts & Trails agreed to calls for the state to continue to own the house, but it will be maintained and managed by the private nonprofit as a recreation facility. Its operations will be subject to state park policies, such as mud season trail closures. Vermont Huts & Trails maintains a statewide network of hut accommodations along trails and other recreational assets. 
The renovations to the house will include making the building ADA-accessible. Likewise, the trail leading to the building will be modified to accommodate adaptive mountain bikes, Kehlmann said. 
Until work begins, project planners are taking steps to protect the delicate wood structure from the elements — its roof is covered with a tarp, for example. “Our goal is to use as much of the original material as possible,” Kehlmann said.  
Between now and next spring, Kehlmann said Vermont Huts & Trails will be working to raise $137,000 for the project. To date, $400,000 of the project’s estimated $537,000 budget has already been obtained through congressional appropriations. She is leading a new initiative called Friends of the Goodell House to recruit volunteers interested in helping with fundraising. 
“There are a lot of restrictions because the project is on state land. Many grants are not applicable, so we’ll be focusing on private foundations and private donors to raise the remaining funds,” she said.

Members are having to adjust their expectations on what crops they’re receiving as well as alter their grocery store needs.

Kate Kampner is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
When Robin Berger became a member of the Intervale Community Farm CSA in 1998, she said that toward the end of the summer pickups, in October, the farm would have a membership survey and invite members for hot cider.
But these days, Berger said, “It is no longer cold in October.” 
As global temperatures continue breaking records, farmers worldwide are seeing disruptions in their farming schedules, including shifting harvesting times and changing crop choices. 
CSAs, an agricultural business model which stands for community supported agriculture, is a program in which members sign up for weekly shares to get a promised set of produce for the year prior to harvesting season. This model provides farms with a secured revenue and an understanding on what they need to grow and what equipment to buy to make themselves profitable.  
While farms try to adjust their CSA formats by making them more flexible or diversifying their crops, they are also trying to keep membership afloat. Berger, along with many other longtime CSA members, has noticed climate disruptions, such as warmer weather and flooding creeping into their produce-filled lives. Members are having to adjust their expectations on what crops they’re receiving as well as alter their grocery store needs. While some choose to stick with it, others don’t put up with the insecurity. 
In 2023 and 2024, the Intervale Community Farm was hit by summer flooding that damaged and destroyed many farms and homes. While the land was able to recover, the farm still lost many of their regular products, including carrots, butternut squash and onions, Berger said.

“There are some things they just couldn’t plant again in time for them to get a harvest,” Berger said. She said she and other CSA members have talked about how they have to remember which produce they now have to get at the grocery store that they normally don’t. 
“I’m just out of practice, all my onions have come from the farm basically since they’ve had a CSA,” Berger said. 
She also saw how members used to get Brussels sprouts at the summer share, but are now only available for the winter share. Berger said this is because “it’s just not going to frost before the end of the summer share,” due to the warmer weather carrying into the fall. Regardless of changes in her produce lifestyle, Berger never considered ending her CSA membership. 
However, some CSA members might have felt differently when they saw changes in their subscription.
Andy Jones, the Intervale’s farm manager, said the team typically saw a 90% membership renewal rate from one year to the next, but after the floods, they saw it drop to 80–85%. This decrease was largely due to a proportion of newer members who didn’t have a CSA track record.

Jones said this wasn’t a shock. He saw the same drop in members in 2011 and 2012 when Hurricane Irene hit. In the long run, the farm has a successful track record of consumer value and quality of produce, he said. 
“People that have been with us for many years can see that,” Jones said. “It’s harder to do that when you’re brand new.” 
The Farm Upstream, a certified organic farm in Jericho, is in its first season doing a CSA and trying to keep their model — which is based on the Intervale farm — as flexible as possible for members. This includes occasional choice in produce and adjusting pick-up times if needed. 
“We’re trying to create models that work for people’s lifestyles,” said Jake Kornfeld, one of the five owners of the farm. 
The team knows what to expect when it comes to preparing for floods and climate adaptation as all five of them have worked with CSAs in the past. One of the farm owners, Tucker Andrews, saw his previous farm get wiped out last summer by floods.
The farm’s land, which was meticulously chosen, steers clear of floodplains for the most part and has well-drained soil. The team also diversifies their crops and practices successive planting, the process of planting a crop on the same field that was just harvested, which allows for seasonal variability. 
“If some catastrophe happens, we can bounce back in a couple of weeks, and that should be okay,” Kornfeld said. 
The owners plan on hosting community events with their members, including farm tours and potlucks. “It’s just a way to make sure people feel like they’re a part of something that’s more than a transaction,” Kornfeld said.

Jeanette Berry, another longtime member of the Intervale CSA, said even though there was crop loss on the farm, it never crossed her mind to quit the farm because of it. “The produce that we got (after the floods) was still overall cheaper than if we bought it at the store,” she said. 
Berry said some Intervale CSA members were offered a partial refund in response to the missing produce. But she didn’t even consider taking it. “It’s a minor contribution to the farm, to not ask for a refund on a few weeks of lost crops,” Berry said. 
The only drawback of the CSA that Berry could think of was that she had too many vegetables in her refrigerator. “We have so much choice in what we can pick up,” she said. 
That’s the goal for Ananda Gardens, a Vermont CSA based in Montpelier that focuses a lot of time and energy on making sure there are options for their members. The farm offers produce delivery and pickups for their CSA and has 60 to 80 different varieties of crops. 
“That’s one of the benefits of having a very diversified CSA,” said Melisa Oliva, one of the owners of the farm, “You don’t have all your eggs in one basket.” 
The farm was minimally impacted by the 2023 flooding when they lost a greenhouse of tomatoes. Oliva said that the potatoes that they get from a partnership with another farm seemed limited at the time of the flooding. 
“It’s on the back burner all the time,” Oliva said  about extreme weather events in the state. “When are we going to be impacted? What is going to happen?” 
Although they haven’t dealt with a lot of rainfall this year, the farm has made adjustments due to summer heat waves, she said. The team placed a cover mesh in their greenhouses because the crops can burn from the heat. They’ve also had to shift their farmwork earlier. “By 3 p.m., it’s just too warm,” Oliva said. 
But this internal preparation doesn’t stop or limit her team. “We’re committing to planting those tomatoes, and we are committed together to strengthen the fabric of the local economy,” Oliva said.

[…]","(Getty Images)The leader of a Louisiana nonprofit that coordinates organ transplants says it has transformed from one of the nation’s lowest ranking organizations of its kind to one of the best in less than two years.
In 2023, the Louisiana Organ Procurement Agency ranked among the bottom 10 in the country for its organ donation rate. It faced scrutiny from the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which oversees organ procurement operations.
LOPA is now on track to rank among the top 10, according to its top executive, Brett Gordon. The agency’s current donation and transplant rates will make it a Tier 1 organization, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s highest rating category, he said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The motivation for LOPA’s progress is a new federal rating system launched in 2022 that set strict standards for a medical specialty area that had shown little improvement in response to skyrocketing demand for organs over the past 20 years.
There are currently 56 organ procurement organizations in the United States. A 2017 study from the Bridgespan Group, a philanthropy consultancy, referred to them as “government-granted monopolies” with few incentives to improve for a lack of competition. As a result, demand for organ transplants was far outpacing the supply of organs.  
The study noted 6,000 to 8,000 people died each year while on a transplant waiting list, and 28,000 available organs from deceased donors were going unused and wasted annually. 
Before 2022, organ agency evaluations did a poor job of assessing their success at achieving their ultimate goal — providing organs for successful transplants — according to the Bridgespan study. 
One of the old metrics was the number of organs procured per donor. A individual can donate up to eight organs, but that number tends to be less from older donors. As a result, organ agencies were pursuing younger donors while overlooking older, single-organ donors. 
Another measure was the number of organs recovered per “eligible death,” which was self-reported and subject to interpretation, the study found.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services implemented new evaluation standards in 2022 that judged organ agencies based on the number of people donating at least one organ and the number of organs obtained and successfully transplanted. 
The new metrics, referred to as the donation rate and the transplantation rate, led groups to focus on obtaining more organ donations. With the updated rules in place, LOPA’s decided to reform its operations. The organization identified several areas in need of improvement and began expanding their staff, Gordon said. 
The first focus was referrals. LOPA learns about potential organ donors primarily through hospitals and coroners’ offices. These referrals need to come as soon as possible because it’s a race against the clock to transplant a viable organ. 
The nonprofit that coordinates organ transplants in SC could fold under federal change

“It’s really critical because it has to be timely,” Gordon said. “We needed to be present in the hospital.”
LOPA increased its hospital development staff, primarily nurses and other medical professionals who are trained and educated in organ procurement and know about the timelines and protocols. They also communicate with hospitals and doctors on identifying potential donors. 
LOPA also retrained and added staff to its family services team to increase the chances that people would donate the organs of their deceased relatives. This can be the most difficult and sensitive part of the process, and it takes a special kind of person to approach a grieving family member about an organ donation, Gordon said. Family services members need to have high levels of empathy and be trained in grief support, he added.
The agency also added new life support systems to its organ recovery clinic that keep donated organs viable for extended periods. 
With these changes, LOPA was able to increase its referrals, which led to more organ donations and more successful transplants, from 725 to 883 — a 22% increase — in just one year. 
Although the 2022 federal rules have spurred a positive transformation at LOPA, organ agencies in other states have struggled under the changes. 
South Carolina’s We Are Sharing Hope SC was ranked among the bottom agencies alongside LOPA back in 2023 and has continued to struggle since then, according to the South Carolina Daily Gazette. 
Sharing Hope President David DeStefano has voiced concerns that the new rules unfairly fault organ procurement agencies for things that are beyond their control, such as a transplant center rejecting an organ.
A person’s age, health and manner of death — including whether they died in the hospital — all factor into the viability of their organs. Under the new rules, any person under age 75 who dies of heart failure, a loss of blood flow to the brain, drug overdose, suicide or drowning counts as a potential donor.
That puts an aging, unhealthy, rural state such as South Carolina at a disadvantage, DeStefano told the Gazette.
The new rules have prompted organ agencies to procure organs they once passed over because of a donor’s age and other health factors that might cause a recipient’s body to reject it. The Bridgespan study noted those risk-averse concerns did not correlate with better transplant outcomes. Advances in medicine and technology have increased both the number and success of transplants, the research found.
Just last year, doctors in Missouri successfully transplanted a liver from a 98-year-old man to a 72-year-old woman, according to the Associated Press.
In the last federal review, Sharing Hope was listed among 10 organ agencies at risk of losing their certification. The same list included LOPA at the time, but next year’s review will look very different for Louisiana, Gordon said. 
“We had to experiment,” he said. “But we took intelligent risks to improve.”

Were their vehicles living secret lives?","If E-ZPass was to be believed, Dick Benson’s white Chevy Tahoe and Gail Benson’s black Volvo S80 had secret lives. 
Did the Tahoe get to Logan airport in Boston without Dick on April 15, 2024, tracked by E-ZPass on the Mass Pike through the Ted Williams Tunnel? Did the Volvo frequently go to Long Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland without Gail? 
The Volvo went on puzzling trips every month, according to the electronic highway tolling system. 
The couple, retirees who live in the Hartford suburb of Berlin, eventually solved the mystery as a case of mistaken identity by E-ZPass photographic toll-by-plate readers: The Bensons were paying tolls incurred by a state legislator, Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford.
Identifying the problem was relatively easy. 
Fixing it, not so much.
What followed was a struggle that exposes weaknesses in the automated collection of bridge and highway tolls by E-ZPass, a system that completes 4 billion transactions and collects $13.8 billion annually for dozens of tolling authorities in 17 states using transponders and photographic plate readers. Mistakes are inevitable.
But when it comes to resolving wrongful charges — or providing answers to a reporter for a story about how the company addresses such issues — little is easy about E-ZPass. 
“The DMV will admit clearly that the bureaucracy of that company or that operation is horrible, just horrible,” Dick said.
No one at the Department of Motor Vehicles contradicted him. Neither did Paris, who had his own fight with E-ZPass trying to rectify what he owed once the Bensons flagged they had been unwittingly paying tolls on his behalf, perhaps as much as $800 over 14 months.
“They are the culprit in all of this,” Paris said of E-ZPass. “And it’s also a multimillion-dollar company, yet you can’t get in contact with anyone.”
It started with the license plates
The roots of the Bensons’ conflict with Paris and E-ZPass begins in late 1994, the final months of the administration of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. It was long before Paris was a driver and two years before E-ZPass was introduced in metro New York.
Dick Benson was an aide and all-purpose troubleshooter for the governor, the same job he performed for most of Weicker’s years in the U.S. Senate.
One of his last chores before the administration handed over the keys in January 1995 to Gov. John G. Rowland — Benson recalled walking out of the Capitol on the last day with Weicker, accompanied by Rowland — was to distribute the remaining store of low-digit license plates to friends and supporters. 
He was told to include himself, and he did.
Dick, an Army sergeant who lost a leg in 1970 when another soldier tripped an explosive booby trap in a dense jungle outside Saigon, has a disabled veterans tag: 3. Gail’s passenger plate is 145, the same three digits on the legislative plate assigned to Paris, a Democrat who represents the 145th District of Stamford.

The Bensons have since learned there is nothing exclusive about low-digit plates — and that legislators do not always heed admonitions about the out-of-state use of legislative plates.
Winners of General Assembly races last year got congratulatory notes from Tony Guerrera, the commissioner of motor vehicles and former legislator. He told them legislative plates with their district numbers were available for $14, a cost in addition to registration fees every motorist pays. Lawmakers must keep their permanent registrations current.
“Legislative plates should be used on vehicles traveling within Connecticut only,” Guerrera warned, in bold. “Electronic tolling systems in neighboring states may not distinguish between legislative plates and similarly numbered vehicle plates otherwise issued by the CT DMV.”
Guerrera was uncertain if the warning had been issued in previous years. He only smiled when asked to speculate if any Connecticut lawmakers bothered to remove  their legislative plates before venturing north to the Mass Pike or south to New York.

Many states, Connecticut included, utilize the same numbers in different classifications of motor-vehicle plates. The DMV says there are four in Connecticut with 145: Gail Benson’s Volvo, Paris’ Kia Telluride, a motorcycle and a bus.
There are 10 vehicles other than Dick’s Tahoe bearing a Connecticut license plate with the number 3. They include a “classic” vehicle, a trailer and a fire apparatus, and a legislative plate assigned to Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, a Democrat who represents the 3rd House District of Hartford. Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, who represents the 3rd Senate District, no longer uses a legislative plate.
(Incorrect E-ZPass charges on the Tahoe were minimal, and the Bensons did not pursue what kind of vehicle was charged for the tolls on the trip to Logan. Gonzalez said it wasn’t her.)
Each of those plate types is distinctive to the human eye but not always to the photographic readers of E-ZPass. Gonzalez said her legislative plate has been correctly recognized by Mass Pike toll-by-plate readers, but Guerrera and Millie Torres Ferguson, a deputy DMV commissioner, say the system appears to default at times to an assumption a plate is on a passenger vehicle.
And that’s how Dick and Gail Benson started getting billed for the travels of Paris, a young Democrat who was elected in 2020 and got his first blue-striped legislative tag bearing his district number upon taking office in January 2021.
The Bensons did not immediately notice the mystery trips. They had an E-ZPass account that was automatically paid by a credit card, and they did not check the monthly on-line statement of E-ZPass charges.
The first sign of trouble came at the end of 2023, when West Hartford mailed Gail a delinquent violation notice demanding $45.40 for an unpaid parking ticket issued on Farmington Avenue at 12:45 p.m. on Nov. 9.
“I hadn’t been to West Hartford in a year,” she said.
When she objected, West Hartford informed her that the vehicle ticketed at a parking meter was a Kia, not her Volvo. The town excused the ticket after the DMV confirmed there was a Kia with a 145 tag — a legislative plate.
It was then the Bensons reviewed their E-ZPass statement and found the discrepancies. They were easy to spot. Trips taken by the Bensons were listed on the statement by the serial numbers on their E-ZPass transponders. Tolls incurred by photographic plate readers listed the plate, 145.
One quirk of the system: If the Bensons did not have an account, they would have been billed by mail with an invoice accompanied by a photograph of the car for which they were being charged. They would have instantly realized that the tag was a legislative plate, not Gail’s.
But so long as the E-ZPass account had sufficient funds, a charge involving a plate associated with their account would be deducted.
The Bensons began disputing charges, though they say they were told E-ZPass would only go back for a year. Beginning on Dec. 12, 2023, they began getting credits in monthly statements, $99.27 the first time. But the incorrect charges on the 145 plate continued.
They wrote to the E-ZPass customer service center in Albany on Jan. 4, 2024, informing the organization of the mix-up with Gail’s 145 plate and the one on Paris’ car. “We have been overcharged hundreds of dollars for this past year, and most likely for several years,” they wrote.
Theresa C. Bates of the CT DMV’s compliance unit followed with a letter to E-ZPass confirming Paris was the owner of the Kia with the legislative plate 145.

Based on statements reviewed by Connecticut Mirror, they eventually got credits for $451.89. They continued to push for what they felt was a full accounting from E-ZPass and from Paris.
Paris, meanwhile, had his own issues with E-ZPass. Once Paris was deemed responsible for many of the charges originally levied on the Bensons, E-ZPass tried to collect substantial late fees. Paris said he should not be assessed for late fees on charges he never got.
The Bensons appreciate his frustration with E-ZPass but do not see him as blameless. One question: Did Paris ever wonder who was paying his $8.25 toll on the Henry Hudson Parkway into the city? Or the $14.75 to cross the Hudson on the George Washington Bridge or through the Lincoln or Holland tunnels?
Paris said he had an E-ZPass account and assumed he was being billed. His transponder, he said, clearly had gone inactive, and his E-ZPass was attached to the plate on a previous car, not his recent permanent registration or legislative plate. He said he pays his bills.
“If anything is coming to my house, it is getting paid,” he said.
Based on statements shared with The Connecticut Mirror, he once again had an active E-ZPass transponder and account as of last spring. When the Bensons contacted him again in March, he referred them to Torres Ferguson, the deputy DMV commissioner whose previous duties included being the department’s legislative liaison.
“I am current with E-ZPass,” he said. 
The Bensons, meanwhile, recently got another refund check from the MTA Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which had issued their E-ZPass more than a decade ago. It came as the CT Mirror was pressing the authority to answer questions about the process.
“Our MTA team was able to get a total of $242.98 refunded to the couple for tolls they did not incur at MTA B&T, PANYNJ, and NYSTA E-ZPass crossings as well as E-ZPass agencies in the states of Florida, Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island,” Laura Cala-Rauch, a media liaison for the MTA, said in an email to CT Mirror.
In a phone call, Cala-Rauch said the resolution negated the need for a story.
She eventually answered several questions posed by email, stating that photographic images can be retained for up to eight years.
Is there a process for reviewing the photographic evidence when there is a dispute over a charge by mail? Is there a written policy regarding dates by which a charge must be challenged that you can provide?
“The sooner a toll is disputed, the more options we have in resolving a customer inquiry,” she replied.
If there is a policy, it was not provided.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7561-2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-17 05:56:11.703134

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Paint rollers and used brushes and wooden stir sticks crusted with a cheerful shade called “morning blossom” are in a pile on the wooden porch, waiting for the job to resume come daylight.
Every so often I peer out the narrow panes of the front door to catch a glimpse of the tools, anxious for the work to resume. My painter friend and his family of helpers have been doing all the labor, standing on ladders or bending low to the ground. They have chipped and scraped and wire-brushed the cracked and peeling walls, making them ready for a new coat.
This simple but labor-intensive task of maintaining a century-old house has made me think of changes to another historic structure, much older and farther away in nearly every sense. The transformation of the White House into a gilded temple to power is increasingly alarming. It has become an American Versailles, fit for a king and not a president, a monument to a dictatorial ambition.
I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln’s 1858 musing on democracy, a note apparently written to himself: “As I would not be a slave, I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy. Whatever differs from this, to the extent of the difference, is no democracy.”
I’m thinking about democracy as I return to my own work.
It’s the first Wednesday night in August, and I’m at my desk in the center of our house on Constitution Street, fingers hesitant over the plastic keys of a computer keyboard. Sweat runs down my ribs. I type a phrase and delete it, then repeat. There seems to be no way to start the damned column.
We’ve been without air conditioning for a week.
The heat seems to have gathered behind my eyes in a thermal prose-killing cloud. The haze is irritatingly coffee resistant. I can find nothing, not even an ice pack wrapped in a towel and held to the back of my neck, to relieve my discomfort.
The repairman we rely on to keep the air warm or cool, according to the season, came out and took a look. He always brings his dog with him, a naturally curious collie that roams at will and often has be called from ranging too far afield. After calling for the dog to come back from across the street, our repairman said the compressor was shot. He delivered the bad news in a tone meant to remind me of all the times during the past few summers he’d managed to keep the unit running, despite it being 25 years old. He’s also hard of hearing, so his conversation is a notch or two louder than what could be considered normal. Now the old unit had finally defeated him, he fairly shouted, and we needed a brand-new, three-ton unit. Then he bellowed for the dog to get out of the neighbor’s yard.
He could have a new unit delivered and ready to install the next day. OK, I said. But there was some mix-up with the shipping and our unit was misdirected to some town far away — seems like it was Death Valley, but I’m probably imagining that. Because it was the time of year when AC units were in high demand, he couldn’t promise when it would arrive. It might be a week, or perhaps more.
So we waited.
The first few days weren’t so bad. While not exactly cool, the highs were in the 80s and sometimes at night the lows dipped into the 60s. We opened doors and windows and left them open. I found myself standing near the window in the kitchen, feeling the night air through the screen, and thinking of how much it felt like summer nights when I was a boy in Baxter Springs.
We had no central air on Cleveland Street back then, just a huge machine jammed in a window of the living room attached to a garden hose that dripped water on a big rotating fan. It made things damp, if not cool. But the air that came in through the window in my bedroom was pleasant and carried the scent of grass and river not far away and the promise of dawn.
Back in the present, the days on Constitution Street became warmer. The heat index was well over 100 during the day, and the nights were sweltering.
Late Wednesday night is my usual time to compose my Sunday columns, and when things go well the hours dissolve until I have a passable draft of a couple of thousand words. I’ll print out the pages and leave them on the dining room table, beneath the big map of the United States we use for reference as well as decoration.
Then I’ll sleep.
Before dawn, Kim rises and has her coffee and feeds the cats and eats her homemade bran muffin and does her five-mile walk. Then she’ll go through the pages with a green pen. She will circle words and suspect passages and leave sometimes hard-to-read notes in the margins — rw? tense? awk. — and then we’ll talk about it, and I’ll revise at least once.
When the writing doesn’t go well, the hours become a weight.
That first Wednesday of August seemed like a double burden as I attempted to pull the column together. There was no draft on the dining room table for Kim to read when she got up. I managed to finish it later that day, after another three hours of work, but the rhythm had been broken and I felt oddly unsynchronized.
The next day the AC unit arrived, having been retrieved from Death Valley or Kathmandu or wherever it had been. Following an afternoon of work and calling for the dog to get out of the neighbor’s business, we had cool air blowing out of the vents downstairs again.
There are those who live without air conditioning, by necessity or choice. In Kansas, 93% of homes are air conditioned, according to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But because air conditioning contributes to outside heating and changes human perception of seasonal discomfort, some like Stan Cox avoid the A/C altogether (although he concedes in a New York Times essay that he’ll turn on the central air on the hottest days of the year). The AC also separates us from the outside, so much so that I hadn’t realized how much I missed the evening song of the cicadas.
I am generally heat tolerant and am comfortable at indoor temperatures that have Kim racing for the thermostat. But the older I get, the greater a burden the heat becomes. I also increasingly leave chores that I used to do myself — such as the painting — to others.
My contribution is a little carpentry work here and there, like fixing the treads on the wooden steps. Ladders are not for me. But I’ve experienced an unexpected satisfaction in seeing the progress, in going to the hardware store and buying paint to match the original color, in selecting a new shade for the trim — “nice tan.” It is nice, I suppose, but if asked I would simply describe the colors as yellow and brown.
The satisfaction comes not from doing some badly needed maintenance, after years when I was either too busy or too broke to have it done, but in making a statement. A stand is being made, a commitment to an old house on a working-class street in a town that is experiencing economic distress. The unemployment rate is now 6.5%, according to the Kansas Department of Labor, the highest in the state for cities over 25,000. We are painting the house not to sell, but to live in, although should we get out? was the subject of many heavy discussions over the dinner table.
For the foreseeable future, this historic Kansas neighborhood will remain our home. Kim and I discussed moving to Missouri or some other state, debating the merits of a new location as we studied the map on the dining room wall. But she fears if I moved away from Kansas, I would lose my identity.
She may be right.
The choice of staying or going was not something to take for granted. Too many Americans don’t have a choice of staying or going — and many of them don’t have a house, apartment or other suitable place to live. Our first gratitude, besides loving and being loved, should always be for food and shelter.
Our home will never be a showplace, but it’s lousy with history.
The house is an artefact of a time when this neighborhood, near the heart of Emporia, was rather higher on the social ladder. Inside there is stained glass and oak floors and other reminders of the apparently comfortable life, in the 1920s, of a Latin professor and his family. Bill Holtz taught at the local teacher’s college and he walked the same sidewalks. On the corner, across a brick pavement in desperate need of repair, the name of our street is stamped into the concrete, along with a date: 1916.
The weather has been especially hard on the house during the past couple of years, including roof damage, an upstairs window that was blown in during a storm, and a favorite maple tree in the back yard that fell and landed on the roof of the garage. The yard floods in heavy rains and so will the basement if the sump pump fails. The kitchen pipes freeze in winter. Critters get into the attic. We went through an odd period when yellowjackets infiltrated the upstairs and tried their damnedest to build a nest on the shaft of a ceiling fan. I received a nasty sting on my right hand during that episode, but luckily the hornets haven’t been back.
Now is a time of rebuilding, even in the face of uncertainty.
We are, as a nation, in the most chaotic period of the last 50 years. Anybody who claims to know what will happen next is either a prophet or a fool, and I’m afraid I’ve met damned few prophets in my life. We are at an extraordinary inflection point in history, a time filled with both peril and promise.
The peril is that Lincoln’s government “of the people, by the people, and for the people” may indeed perish from the earth. The promise is that American democracy may yet achieve the dream of Martin Luther King Jr., who glimpsed a day when we all would be free at last.
The turbulence of the events we now live through are not adequately described in any news report, but can only be fully appreciated at the breakfast tables and front porches of homes in Kansas and across the country. The consequences of decisions that have made most Americans feel helpless are realized not in the gilded corridors of power but in the small places in which we live, the tables where we eat, the bedrooms and sometimes the sidewalks where we sleep. Many desperate conversations are being held at this moment over a range of what ifs. What if I can’t find a job? What if we can’t afford groceries? What will we do if federal agents, their faces masked, come to take away our friends and neighbors?
Or us.
There are federal troops on the streets of Washington, D.C., ostensibly for law enforcement, and a protestor was recently arrested for assault on a federal immigration agent — for hurling a sandwich.
It is, as I type, another Wednesday night.
It’s quiet now, but when my painter friend and his helpers come tomorrow there will be scraping and wire brushing and more painting. The cracked and peeling paint of our house on Constitution Street will slowly give way to a fresh coat of “morning blossom.”
With resolve and paint, there are now a couple fewer questions on Constitution Street. We will stay. The trim will be “nice tan.” This will remain our home — as America is our home — and the talk of relocating to another state or even Canada is over. There will be columns written on Wednesday nights and tweaked on Thursday mornings. Cats will be fed and yellowjackets battled.
The gilding of the White House may continue, but no amount of gold leaf will hide the stain of authoritarianism. Our home’s honest yellow and brown paint is an investment in ourselves, a hope for our community, and a dream for America.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-17 08:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Amtrak’s new Acela starts soon. Worth the wait?,Jim Cameron | Columnist,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/17/amtraks-new-acela-starts-soon-worth-the-wait/,Is the NextGen Acela ready for prime time?  We shall see. But beware of the PR hype  proclaiming NextGen Acela as the savior of American passenger rail.,"Amtrak’s oldest new trains are arriving shortly: the NextGen Acela (finally) starts running between Washington and Boston on August 28.
Ordered in 2016 for $1.8 billion, the first trains arrived from the Alstom assembly facility in Hornell N.Y. in 2020.  That meant jobs there for 1,300 workers and business for 180 suppliers across 29 states.  These new trains are 95% “made in the USA.”


Like any new trains, the new Acelas required extensive testing, especially for crash worthiness and compatibility with the aging tracks and wires in the Northeast Corridor.  That’s when the problems started.
Even before field testing, it took Amtrak 14 attempts to finally pass computer simulations.  In road testing, windows shattered, there was water corrosion and leaks in the hydraulic tilting system.  Road testing also found issues with the trains’ wheels’ traction on our old tracks. And the pantographs (drawing electric power from the overhead catenary wires) kept losing contact at high speed.  Some 129 field modifications were ordered. 
That’s why these sleek new trains are about three or four years “late.”  But was it worth the wait?
Twenty-eight train sets are on order, but only five will be in service to start, the rest going into service by 2027.  They’ll replace the first-generation Acelas which have been running for up to 27 years, accumulating millions of miles of travel.
Despite constant maintenance and repairs, the older Acelas have been showing their age.  Reports indicate that some train sets have been stored, cannibalized for spare parts to keep the other aging trains running.    Eventually the old trains will all be scrapped. 
Is the NextGen Acela ready for prime time?  We shall see. But beware of the PR hype coming your way from Amtrak, proclaiming NextGen Acela as the savior of American passenger rail.
Make no mistake… these are nice new trains.  The train sets will be bigger: nine cars vs. six, carrying up to 386 passengers vs 304.  And the new Acela trains can add three more cars if needed while the old Acela sets were permanently coupled.  And with more train sets, there will hopefully be a greater frequency of service. 
The interior of the new cars looks sweet… comfy seats, fold-down tables, power plugs and more wheelchair spots.  There will be a new Café Car and promised (free) 5G Wi-Fi connectivity.  Seating will be two-by-two in Business Class (there is no coach class) and two by one in First Class with meals there brought to your seat. The windows will be larger and the ride is said to be smoother, even at top speed.
But here’s where the hyperbole hits the tracks.
The NextGen Acelas are being described as offering “160 mph” speeds.  But there are only 32 miles of the 457 mile tracks from Washington, D.C. to Boston that can handle those speeds… four miles in New Jersey and 28 miles in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. 
In Connecticut the new Acelas, like the old ones, will go no faster than Metro-North… maybe up to 90 mph in a few stretches.  You can blame our many bridges and curving tracks for the lower speed limits.
There is no word yet on fares, though they will probably match existing Acela fares.  This is already an expensive ride: one-way from Stamford to Boston is about $330 in business class and $573 in first class (compared to $134 and $227 on the slower, 50+ year old Amfleet Northeast Regional trains).  Running time on Acela: about three hours.  On the older trains, three and a half hours.
Are those fares worth the promised speed and comfort?  Maybe –if you’re on an expense account.  But I’ll take it for a spin (on my own dime) and will let you know.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nextgen-acela-engine-832x1024.jpeg,,,2025-08-17 07:56:29.514089

In her nomination speech to more than 200 state committee members, Cotton said she heard the call for change, “that you needed to feel included.”
“I’m here to be your voice,” she said. “I’m also hear to be the voice of those who feel hopeless so that they can feel hopeful.”

In his acceptance speech Saturday at the Sheraton Four Points hotel in Little Rock, Jones alluded to the campaign between him and Cotton by mentioning a Bible verse “that says that as iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend” through debate and dialogue.
“Now’s the time we come back together. Now’s the time we move forward … and carry those Democratic values outside of this room,” he said. “Outside, not everybody shares those same values. And we’ve got to be the people that carry that foward for Arkansas. We’ve got to be the people that do that for our nation.”
He pledged to help grow the number of active county Democratic committees to 70.
“Right now, we’ve got somewhere between 52 and 55, so we’ve all got some work to do,” Jones said.
He also promised to produce a five-year strategic plan within 90 days that will take advantage of the skills and talents of county and auxiliary committees to help recruit and elect more Democrats.
“‘Raise money and elect Democrats,’ isn’t a plan,” he said in a statement of candidacy. “The next Chair must establish a strategic vision for our party and collaborate with every team member to meet a long-term goal.”
Jones demonstrated fundraising prowess in his race for Congress last year against Rep. French Hill, and has continued to raise money on behalf of Democratic candidates since, according to his biography.
In introductory remarks Saturday, state Rep. Andrew Collins of Little Rock praised Tenille’s work rebuilding the party, for helping secure the victory of state Rep. Diana Gonzales Worthen of Springdale – the first Latina in the Legislature –  and the first net gain for her party in the House in nearly two decades.

(Image via Inciweb)At least seven large wildfires were burning in Montana on Saturday after a slow start to the fire season in the Treasure State.
The state reports there have been 1,672 reported wildfires this year, including 78 in the last week. There were seven Montana fires on the National Interagency Fire Center’s daily situation report on Saturday: Bivens Creek, Windy Rock, Cloudrest, Summer Springs, Horn, Mission Butte, and Pony Creek.
There were 273 people assigned to those seven fires on Saturday, according to the report, and the burns are estimated to have cost approximately $2 million to fight so far. No structures have been reported lost in those blazes.
Mission Butte
The largest fire burning in the state is the Mission Butte fire, which is three miles from St. Xavier in Big Horn County.
According to the state’s fire site, it was at 6,149 acres, which would make it the largest fire this year in Montana. It was primarily burning tall grass and brush. The fire was active, with flanking and torching behavior, state reports on the fire noted.
That fire is primarily being managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Crow Agency.
Horn
Burning in Madison County, the Horn fire briefly caused evacuation orders this week, though those were lifted on Friday morning.
Evacuation warnings are in effect for residents east of Highway 87 and south of Highway 287. The fire is burning 17 miles northwest of West Yellowstone, between Cliff Lake and Highway 87. The state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation said the fire was estimated at 2,800 acres and was caused by lightning.
Several roads are closed in the area: Horn Creek Road, Cliff Lake Road, and Wade Lake Road. Highway 87 was briefly closed during the fire, and state officials asked residents to be mindful of fire traffic on the road.
The DNRC noted it’s now a Type 3 incident, and resources on the ground include fire crews, 10 engines, a water tender and a bulldozer. Helicopters are also assisting.
The fire was about 50% contained on Saturday. Crews are mostly engaged in mop-up operations, the fire’s report on Inciweb stated. Fuels were primarily grass and brush.
Windy Rock
Burning 12 miles north of Garrison, the Windy Rock fire was at 600 acres and 0% contained on Saturday.
The cause was unknown. A community meeting for the fire will be held at the Avon Community Center at 208 Main St. at 7 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 17. The fire is currently jointly managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the DNRC.
“There are a lot of structures close to the fire perimeter,” said Carmen Borchelt, the public information officer for the fire.

It was “extremely active” on Friday, the Inciweb report on the fire noted. A heavy air tanker and four helicopters were assigned to the fire. It’s burning dead and downed fuels, and access to the fire has been a challenge for firefighters, the report noted. Fire behavior included spotting, group torching and uphill runs.
The fire is moving to the east, Borchelt said. The BLM has also issued a closure order for all of its public land in Powell County. Containment is at 0%, and there are other factors at play with this fire, too.
“The Windy Rock Fire is located near a Wilderness Study Area and a Backcountry Conservation Area, requiring fire operations to take special considerations for these landscapes,” the Inciweb report said.
Cloudrest
A large fire burning in the Tobacco Root Mountains was at 500 acres and “spread rapidly,” an incident overview for the fire stated.
It was discovered on Aug. 14 and is burning at an elevation of 8,100 feet through subalpine fir timber about 9 miles northeast of Sheridan in the Madison Ranger District. Fuels include dead and downed timber, with a large amount of hazard trees or “snags”.
A helicopter did respond to the fire, which was reported via the Alert West camera system. Ten people are assigned to the fire, though additional resources were ordered.
There have been three straight days of critical fire conditions, and the fire’s origin was unknown.
Bivens Creek
Burning near the Cloudrest fire, the Bivens Creek fire is burning 11 miles northeast of Adler and 10 miles east of Sheridan.
The fire was reported on Aug. 13, which prompted a response that included a helicopter. The fire was listed at 500 acres, and its cause was undetermined. There were 35 people assigned to the fire, which is burning through subalpine fir. Behavior consisted of smoldering, creeping, group tree torching and spotting.
Weather, which like the Cloudrest fire has seen three straight days of critical fire weather, is also a concern.
“Firefighters engaged the fire, cutting sawline on the western edge until gusty winds associated with the RED FLAG WARNING prompted fire leadership to pull the crews back to safer areas,” the Inciweb fire report noted.
Summer Springs
The Summer Springs fire, reported on Aug. 13, was at 2,568 acres and at 55% containment.
It’s burning 13 miles southeast of Custer and was caused by lightning. The DNRC had demobilized its county assist team from the fire, Saturday’s Inciweb report on the fire noted.
“Today, crews will continue mop up operations and rehabilitate the control line. Containment of the fire is expected to rise significantly by this evening,” the report stated.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cloudrest-lake-Inciweb-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-16 19:57:14.860878
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-08-16 23:00:00+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,The Fair Share Amendment is delivering,Jim Roosevelt and Andrea Silbert,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/the-fair-share-amendment-is-delivering/,"
Nearly three years after its passage, it’s becoming clear that the millionaires tax has been a total success, and an incredible benefit for our state’s businesses. 
The post The Fair Share Amendment is delivering appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SINCE 2022, when Massachusetts voters approved the Fair Share Amendment tax on incomes over $1 million, debate has swirled over the impact of the new levy on the state’s business climate. 
There’s universal agreement that investments in transportation and public education, which the new tax funds, are crucial to building a dynamic and prosperous economy. But some speculated that multi-millionaires would flee Massachusetts rather than pay the new tax. Last week’s news that the millionaires tax generated $3 billion over the past year should put those fears to rest. 
Prior to its passage, opponents of the Fair Share ballot question predicted it would backfire — failing to generate meaningful revenue to address the state’s transportation and public education needs, and hurting our economic competitiveness along the way. 
But nearly three years later, it’s becoming clearer and clearer — the Massachusetts millionaires tax has been a total success, and an incredible benefit for our state’s businesses. 
Despite predictions of substantial millionaire flight, the number of millionaires and ultra-wealthy individuals in Massachusetts grew significantly over the first two years the Fair Share Amendment was in place.  
The state has experienced revenue gains — $2.46 billion in the first year and nearly $3 billion in the second — that are more than double the state’s initial expectations, and more than even the proponents of the new tax predicted. That’s strong evidence that that multi-millionaires are staying in Massachusetts and paying more in taxes, not fleeing for other states. 
And that revenue is making a real difference. Over the past two and a half years, the state Legislature has approved more than $6 billion in Fair Share investments that are helping to deliver two of the most important resources for Massachusetts businesses: a well-educated workforce and a reliable transportation system.  
From the cradle to career, investments from the millionaires tax are key to growing and supporting the workforce our businesses depend on. 
Thanks to Fair Share funding to expand the number of public pre-K classrooms in cities and towns across the state, thousands of parents can now afford to stay in the workforce after their children are born. 
Kids can’t learn if they’re hungry. So Fair Share is funding in-school breakfast and lunch for every child in the state, helping them succeed in school and start off on a path to long-term success. The millionaires tax is supporting school building improvements across the state, enabling more vocational programs to train the next generation of workers in high-demand careers. And it’s delivered significant funding to every school district in the state, ensuring that schools have more of the resources they need to educate our future workforce. 
Once students graduate, Fair Share is funding free community college and expanded financial aid for low- and middle-income students at UMass and our other state universities. As a result, public college enrollment has increased for the first time in a decade. That means thousands of additional students who are preparing for good jobs with local employers. 
And when our graduates enter the workforce, Fair Share funding is delivering a transportation system they can count on to get to and from work. It’s the key funding mechanism in Gov. Healey’s plan to repair the MBTA after decades of disinvestment, which has resulted in the elimination of subway slow zones, trains that are moving faster, and the hiring of more bus drivers to expand service. 
In other parts of the state, the state’s regional transit authorities are using Fair Share funding to expand their service hours, add weekend service, create new bus routes, and make buses free. And hundreds of millions of dollars have gone into repairing roads and bridges across the state, ensuring that drivers can get to work on time. 
Now, it’s true that Massachusetts faces a migration problem. But it’s not multi-millionaires who are hiring U-Hauls and leaving the state; it’s low- and middle-income workers who can’t afford the high cost of living in Massachusetts.  
By putting more money directly in the pockets of working families with programs like free school meals, college financial aid, and free buses, the Fair Share Amendment is making Massachusetts more affordable for the workers our businesses depend on. 
And these investments are having an impact. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Massachusetts saw its largest population increase in 60 years, and the rate of domestic outmigration has significantly slowed. And this year, Massachusetts was ranked the strongest state economy in the US. 
Now, Massachusetts faces a new threat: billions of dollars in federal budget cuts that are being made to partially offset the cost of a $4.5 trillion federal tax cut that will overwhelmingly benefit the very rich and large corporations.  
As businesses begin to grapple with the effect of these changes on the Massachusetts economy, we’re left with one thought: Thank goodness Massachusetts had the foresight to pass the Fair Share Amendment when we did.

Wes Moore (D) told county leaders gathered in Ocean City that he will unveil efforts to spur affordable housing in the state. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore told a gathering of county leaders Saturday that he is preparing to take action on initiatives he said will ease the cost of housing by spurring new projects.
“We must go faster on affordable housing,” Moore told an audience of county leaders and state Cabinet officials as he delivered the traditional speech to close out the Maryland Association of Counties summer conference in Ocean City.
Housing has been a priority for the governor, but a bill that was part of his legislative priorities was derailed in the 2025 legislative session in part because of opposition from MACo, the association that represents governments in the state’s 24 major political subdivisions.
Moore, speaking at what will be his last summer conference before the 2026 primary, issued a call to action. Half of all Maryland renters pay more than 30% of their income toward housing, he said. The state is ranked 43rd in housing affordability and permitting for new housing units is down almost 40% compared to the period before the 2008 Great Recession, Moore said.
“And it’s not just our people who are hurting,” Moore said. “It’s Maryland’s housing market and economy. If we want to build new bridges to wealth, bring down costs, and supercharge growth, we need to prioritize housing that’s affordable and located near jobs and transportation.”
Moore provided few details on what actions he would take.
He said his effort would focus on streamlining state permitting, leveraging public land for new housing and setting statewide housing goals and tracking progress toward those goals.
Moore also hinted at a potential carrot for counties who work with him.
“This is the moment to reward those jurisdictions that are stepping up to be pro-housing … because everyone must participate for us to succeed,” he said.

Earlier in the week, some county leaders complained Moore and his Department of Housing and Community Development iced them out of a housing policy meeting.
State officials met with county leaders at a hotel away from the convention center. And while state officials said the list of attendees was not exclusive, association officials were adamant that they were explicitly not invited.
Moore’s focus on housing was the largest kernel of policy in a more than 30-minute speech.
Unlike his previous two summer keynote addresses, in which he delivered tough state budget news, Moore this year mentioned the budget only long enough to note that he and lawmakers had to erase a projected $3.3 billion structural deficit as they crafted a compromise balanced budget.
During his remarks, the governor rattled off a list of accomplishments during his time in office.
He also used the platform to criticize — though not by name — Republican President Donald Trump.
The remarks drew mixed reactions.
Maryland is a state where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans 2-1. But most of those blue votes are clustered in central Maryland and outside the District of Columbia. Most of the counties on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland are majority Republican jurisdictions.
And as Moore began to bullet-point federal actions that would hurt the state, he took on the cadence of a man leading a big tent revival.
“Look, I understand that some people view Maryland as a ‘deep-blue state,'” Moore said. “But these policies from D.C. are hurting Democrats and Republicans.”
And as Moore drew attention to counties that would be affected — Montgomery and Prince George’s and Allegany and Wicomico — he punctuated each point with: ” Let’s get really specific.”
Much of the crowd remained polite but silent. Small pockets of others called out in agreement, a response to Moore’s call at a time he said was “steeped in danger and laced with uncertainty.”
“The truth is we are going to lead through this moment, knowing that history has taught us that there is only two things that can get us through difficult moments: God’s grace and steady leadership,” he said.
Moore charged county leaders to join him in a fast-paced effort to deliver results to residents
“We must move with the speed that shows them we understand how fast things are breaking in their lives,” Moore said.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.

Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.

That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.

Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw (R)


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

(Stock photo by Daniel de la Hoz/Getty Images)Utah’s top law enforcement officer and his counterparts from a majority of states this week called on the social media giant Meta to add guardrails to a newly launched Instagram feature allowing the company and anyone who follows a user on the app to see their location.
Instagram on Aug. 6 launched the new feature for all users in the U.S. called Map, which displays the user’s profile picture and location in real-time on a map visible to any mutual followers. It quickly faced backlash from privacy advocates who warn against sharing highly personal data with an intermediary like Meta.
Utah Attorney General Derek Brown and attorneys general from 36 other states sent a letter Wednesday to Instagram executive Adam Mosseri saying that without careful controls, the new feature raises public safety and data privacy concerns, especially for vulnerable users like children and domestic violence survivors.
“Unrestricted location-sharing features pose a particular risk for minors as they can be readily used by sexual predators to identify and geographically target children in the real world,” they wrote. “We know that dangerous individuals are already present on Instagram, and we have serious concerns that this feature will increase the likelihood of hands-on abuse and exploitation.”
Previously redacted details in Utah’s Snapchat lawsuit are now public

The attorneys general are calling on the social media company to prohibit minors from enabling location-sharing; provide clear alerts to adult users about the feature, its risks and how their location data will be used; and allow adult users who opt in to easily disable the feature at any time.
Implementing those measures would demonstrate Meta’s “commitment to protecting the privacy and security of your users while still allowing those who wish to share their location to do so knowingly and with informed consent,” they wrote.
Utah is pursuing several lawsuits looking to challenge the legality of how social media companies interact with minors, including claims against major social media companies Meta, TikTok and Snap Inc.
The New Mexico Department of Justice is also pursuing litigation against Meta and Snap Inc, which owns Snapchat, alleging the companies’ policies fail to protect children.
“Instagram is once again prioritizing engagement over safety and has enabled a potentially dangerous feature without first ensuring the safety of their users, especially kids,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “It is absolutely stunning that the company would allow children on the platform to enable a feature which would provide predators with even more information to target and abuse them.”
“Real-time location features should of course be intentionally built and give users control, which is why Instagram Map’s design already addresses the issues the attorneys general raise: it is off by default, everyone receives a notification explaining what the feature entails and can turn it off whenever they want, and with parental supervision, parents get a notification if their teen starts using it and can block their access to location sharing at any time,” a Meta spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Instagram has accounts designed for teens that are automatically equipped with built-in protections, the company says on its website. That includes limiting who can contact them and what content they can see.
Other attorneys general joining New Mexico in the letter are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
Justice Department demand for state voter lists underscores their importance

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
U.S. House passes bill targeting voting by noncitizens, which is already against the law

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, professor of political science at MIT who studies elections


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

Campbell plant was expected to save Michigan ratepayers $600 million by 2040. (Photo/Sarah Leach)Mandates from President Donald Trump’s administration to retain aging coal plants could cause a massive spike in energy costs, according to an independent analysis commissioned by several environmental groups.
Orders from the U.S. Department of Energy to save coal plants from retirement could cost ratepayers more than $3 billion per year, according to a report from Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. It was carried out on behalf of Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sierra Club.
Under Trump, the agency has issued emergency orders to maintain operations at coal plants that were scheduled for retirement. While federal officials say the coal plants need to stay online to avoid blackouts, power plant owners and state regulators planned their closures because they were no longer economically viable or needed for reliability.
“DOE mandates override those well-informed decisions, inflating electric bills for homeowners and businesses and undermining the competitiveness of U.S. factories and data centers,” the Grid Strategies analysis found.
Across the country, coal plants have phased out as they’ve struggled to compete with cheaper renewables and natural gas. A 2023 analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 99% of existing U.S. coal plants “are more expensive to run than replacement by local wind, solar, and energy storage resources.”
But Trump, who has pushed to unleash more fossil fuel development and to stymie wind and solar, has ordered a retiring coal plant in Michigan to stay online, along with an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania.
“Based on the trend to date and indications that DOE has approached the owners of many retiring fossil power plants about potentially mandating their retention, DOE may attempt to mandate the retention of nearly all large fossil power plants slated for retirement between now and the end of 2028,” reads the Grid Strategies report.
The cost of keeping those plants online would be immense. By 2028, if Trump were to mandate the retention of all fossil fuel plants slated for retirement, the annual cost to ratepayers would be more than $3.1 billion, the analysis found.
The report also considers a number of aging plants that are not yet scheduled for retirement. It finds Trump’s actions could create a “perverse incentive,” causing plant owners to claim they’re planning to shut down, inducing the feds to step in and keep them open, with the cost borne by ratepayers.
Accounting for that possibility, the report found that ratepayer costs could reach $5.9 billion per year to keep the entire aging fossil fuel fleet online. California, Texas and Colorado would see the highest increases in electricity bills.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Voting rights activists continue to be divided over gerrymandering. Here in Wisconsin, members of the Fair Maps Coalition, who just recently succeeded in getting representative voting maps for our state, are understandably alarmed by escalating threats to gerrymander the whole country, as Wisconsin Public Radio reports.
“I just hate it at its core,” Wisconsin League of Women Voters Executive Director Debra Cronmiller told WPR of the gerrymandering duel between Texas and California, as each state seeks to carve out more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
“We can’t save democracy by suppressing voters, and this has to be an opportunity to think about a new process and standards, especially in Wisconsin,” iuscely Flores, Wisconsin Fair Maps organizing director, told WPR.
But the president and CEO of Common Cause, the national organization dedicated to voting rights and fair elections, told members last week that the group “won’t call for unilateral political disarmament in the face of authoritarianism.”
The Common Cause position is tricky. On the one hand the group reaffirms its commitment to nonpartisan redistricting commissions. On the other hand it gives its blessing to California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to suspend exactly the sort of nonpartisan commission the group endorses — and which Wisconsin fair maps advocates have long been fighting for. Supposedly, suspending the commission is a temporary measure while Democrats in the legislature draw up gerrymandered districts in time for the midterms. After they do that, Common Cause, Newsom and various Democrats claim California can undo the gerrymander later and restart the fight for fair maps. Really?
“Independent redistricting commissions are one way — and by far the best way — to draw fair maps and achieve fair representation for every single American,” Virginia Kase Solomón, Common Cause president and CEO wrote in a letter to the group’s members. But, a follow-up email from Common Cause reiterated the group’s non-opposition to Newsom’s plan in California, saying, “As the nation’s leading anti-gerrymandering advocacy group, we understand that Trump and Republican leaders’ attempt to lock in unaccountable power poses a generational threat to our ability to decide our own futures.”
Maggie Daun brought up those same dire threats on her Civic Media radio show when she grilled me about my last column arguing that we can’t gerrymander our way back to democracy. What if this is the existential moment and Trump is about to send troops into cities across the U.S. and destroy democracy, Daun asked. I agree with her that we’re in an existential moment. But just because we want Democrats to do something to stop Trump, as so many people so passionately do, that doesn’t mean that gerrymandering to get a narrow Democratic majority in the House is the right thing to do. For one thing, a new House majority won’t be seated until 2027 and won’t fix the immediate crisis.
Trump is already sending troops into Democratic cities. And his plan to try more federal takeovers will likely unfold before the midterms. What we need right now is a massive popular movement to resist authoritarian overreach, local leaders who stand up to Trump, and courts that continue to hold the line on his administration’s assault on the rule of law.
The courts have played the biggest role in restraining Trump so far, issuing injunctions and blocking his orders Their power has been badly limited by the U.S. Supreme Court, which curtailed judges’ power to issue nationwide injunctions and greenlighted some egregious administrative actions. The current Supreme Court majority has also helped Trump’s larger project of dismantling democracy by gutting the Voting Rights Act and by allowing partisan gerrymandering — which delayed but ultimately did not derail Wisconsin’s efforts to get fair maps.
Common Cause has led the fight against both partisan gerrymandering and the destruction of voting rights. On Saturday, the group declared a National Day of Action, with rallies in communities across the country, including in Wisconsin, to resist Trump’s Texas gerrymandering scheme and his unprecedented deployment of federal troops to run roughshod over local communities. But the group’s message is somewhat muddled, mixing strong language about fairness and voting rights with tolerance for the prospect of blue-state counter-gerrymandering.
One good thing about the gerrymandering brushfire spreading across the nation is that it has provoked a bipartisan backlash. Republicans in New York and California, facing the prospect of being drawn out of their seats, have begun speaking out against the gerrymandering plan for Texas, Politico reports.
Some quick math suggests that Republicans are likely to win a nationwide redistricting war that pulls in Missouri, Indiana, Florida and other red states. But Republicans who are in a minority in California and New York are still worried about losing their seats. “Redistricting is not really an ideological exercise as much as a self-interest exercise,” California-based GOP strategist Rob Stutzman told Politico. Hence blue state Republican House members are calling for their colleagues to stand down in Texas and other red states, lest they lose their seats in the blue state counter-gerrymander. 
Instead of looking to gerrymandering, which is unfair, diminishes democracy and escalates hyper partisanship, opponents of the Trump administration need to keep building a big, pro-democracy movement that unites a majority of the country against Trump’s authoritarian overreach.
Wisconsin could lead the way. 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been holding town halls in Republican districts, reports being deluged with worried questions from both his own and his GOP colleagues’ constituents who don’t like the cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and Social Security staffing in the unpopular “Big Beautiful Bill Act.” Most Americans don’t want to give away their health care, security and well-being so Elon Musk can get a tax cut.
Unfortunately, right-wing activists have played a long game, stacking the Supreme Court, blocking Democratic nominees, destroying the Voting Rights Act and putting the whole Heritage Foundation Project 2025 plan for authoritarianism in place. That won’t be undone in a single midterm election. But it is possible to leverage a broad-based populist movement of people who recognize it’s in their own interest to fight back.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2928-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-16 11:59:16.483110

(James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)ANCHORAGE, Alaska —President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

(Photo by Kevin Hardy/Stateline)BOSTON — During this year’s budget cycle, Oklahoma state Sen. John Haste said lawmakers had two major things on their minds.
“Number one was tax cuts. Number two, what the hell is going on in Washington?” he told a national gathering of state lawmakers last week in Boston.
While Oklahoma lawmakers secured another round of income tax cuts, they are still wrapping their heads around the fiscal impacts of President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax law, Haste said. The measure slashes funding for health care and food assistance.
That legislation, and other Trump actions, proved a central theme of discussion during the National Conference of State Legislatures summit, which organizers said was the largest ever gathering of state lawmakers with more than 1,600 in attendance. Aside from cutting funding, the law imposes costly new administrative burdens on states.
States are still sorting through the long-term impacts of the legislation — and what, if any, actions they can take to soften the blow.
Tracking Medicaid patients’ work status may prove difficult for states
Haste, a Republican, said concern is highest in rural areas, where reduced Medicaid funding could threaten hospitals. He said that just one provision of the law will cut $209 million in funds that help Oklahoma cover the cost of Medicaid, and that the state will need to spend an estimated $30 million on the new cost of checking eligibility twice per year.
“All of those things added together come up to a really big number,” he said, but added: “We don’t know exactly what that is.”
Lawmakers from liberal and conservative states said they are still grappling with the implications of Trump’s signature legislation. With most states boasting solid fiscal positions, some expect to cover new up-front administrative costs by tapping into strong reserve funds. But many are considering reducing services.
Nevada state Sen. Fabian Doñate, a Democrat, said state leaders will have to cut Medicaid eligibility or services since Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo has said he will oppose any efforts to raise taxes.
“That becomes a challenge, right?” Doñate said during a panel discussion on Medicaid. “Do you cut the pregnant mom or the person that makes above 180% of the federal poverty level who’s under 50, or do you cut diapers for seniors?”
At the same time, states must gear up for new bureaucratic mandates from Washington.
“Regardless of how you feel about these provisions — whether these are opportunities or challenges, fantastic or awful — regardless, it’s going to be a heavy lift for states,” said Lauren Kallins, NCSL’s senior legislative director for state-federal affairs.
She said states and organizations, including NCSL, are still awaiting detailed federal guidance on all the changes, which are spread out over several years. But states will need to react quickly.

One provision in the law requires the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are meeting new work requirements. The legislation provided states $200 million, but experts question whether it will be enough to help states implement the changes by the end of 2026.
To meet that deadline, states will need to increase outreach to Medicaid recipients and make new investments in technology, Kallins said. Similarly, states must cover new administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, commonly called food stamps.
Traditionally, the federal government has fully funded SNAP benefits and split administrative costs of the program with states. The new law requires states to fund 75% of administrative costs and requires some states, depending on the accuracy of their eligibility determination, to fund a portion of benefits.
“So that’s another very significant increase for states,” Kallins said.
States in a ‘very, very strong position’
Though revenue growth is slowing, lawmakers and experts pointed out that many states currently enjoy strong budget fundamentals.
That’s true in Utah, which touts deep reserve funding and a rapidly growing economy.
Jonathan Ball, Utah’s legislative fiscal analyst, told conference attendees that the state could rely on some of its reserve for one-time administrative and technical costs associated with the federal legislation.
He said lawmakers and budget writers always have to find creative ways to solve their state’s budget puzzles.
“It’s a little bit maybe scarier, but it’s not a new sort of problem,” he said. “I think you all have the tools, we feel like we have the tools to fix it.”
Still, he said the potential for further federal funding cuts has raised many questions.
“The uncertainty about what happens in the future is huge,” Ball said.
At a separate session focusing on state budgets, financial analyst Geoffrey Buswick said most states have enviable credit ratings, meaning investors can be confident in a state’s ability to pay back debts, which affords it lower interest rates.
Buswick, the managing director and sector leader for public finance at S&P Global Ratings, said states likely have the budgetary cushion to adjust to federal policy changes.
“The states are in a very, very strong position — about the strongest we’ve ever seen,” he said.
Maryland Democratic state Sen. Karen Lewis Young didn’t buy that assessment.
She said her state touts strong reserve funds, but that those can only be used for one-time expenses and not to replace eliminated funding on an ongoing basis. Maryland is facing a huge decline in federal jobs, along with federal cuts in transportation, health and education funding.
“What am I missing in your optimism?” she asked the financial analyst.
Afterward, she told Stateline that Maryland may tout a stronger position compared with other states. But she added that even with low unemployment and a high average income, the federal legislation forces difficult decisions for lawmakers, who are constitutionally mandated to balance the state budget.
“You’ve got to cut from someplace else,” she said. “If you’re losing a pretty large share of your federal match, who do you cut?”
A ‘substantial headache’
Across the country, Democratic lawmakers hope to underscore the cuts in Trump’s new law to weigh down Republicans in state races this year and next.
Hawaii Democratic state Sen. Ronald Kouchi said lawmakers need to ensure constituents understand where the spending cuts originated.
“Who’s going to be blamed when people are left out, when people are hungry and they lose out on educational opportunities?” he asked during a panel. “If we as state legislators do not convey that it is a result of the decisionmakers in Washington, D.C., they will be at our doorstep as the place of last resort.”
Kouchi, the president of the state Senate, said Hawaii leaders had socked away more than $1 billion in reserves. But he said the state cannot fill in all the financial gaps, especially during a time when officials are trying to set aside more in disaster funding and grapple with a slowdown in tourism.
“There is no current financial ability for the state to meet the needs of everyone who is currently being impacted,” he said in an interview.










We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond.


– West Virginia Republican House Speaker Roger Hanshaw


New Mexico state Rep. Meredith Dixon, a Democrat, said her state should be somewhat insulated after directing surplus oil and gas revenues into a new Medicaid Trust Fund. But she said it’s still unclear how much pressure the federal legislation will put on the state.
“We are not protected by any stretch. So we are going to have to look at how we cover those costs. … We’re still digging into everything.”
West Virginia House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, a Republican, said no one in the federal government or at the state level seemed to have a full understanding of the implications of the legislation.
“I look at this bill as Obamacare 2.0: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what’s in it,” he told Stateline.
Hanshaw said the law has some provisions that will benefit West Virginia and others that will cause a “substantial headache.”
“We have no idea yet how we’re going to respond,” he said. “I don’t want to speak for any other state … but I would speculate that’s true for nearly every other state.”

Santiago/Getty Images)BILOXI, Miss. — The Trump administration is developing a powerful data tool it claims will let states identify noncitizens registered to vote. But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.
The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
 
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.
After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
 
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.
Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said Friday that the city has reduced thousands of vacant properties over the last five years, which he said should ultimately help reduce the number of people who experience homelessness by keeping housing costs down by increasing supply.
“Affordability is number one for us in Baltimore,” Scott said at a Friday panel at the Maryland Association of Counties’ summer conference. “Baltimore, as we all know, has a ton of housing stock, but a large portion of that is unlivable, vacant housing throughout our city.”
He reported that since he became mayor in December 2020, the city has reduced the number of vacant properties by about 3,500 units, after a period of more than 20 years when the number of vacant properties had not changed.
“We were at 16,000 vacant properties when I came into office. As of 20 minutes before we started today, we’re now down to 12,510,” he said to applause from MACo attendees.
Improving housing stock and housing access was just one of the many potential solutions offered at a pair of housing events Friday at the conference in Ocean City. Scott was joined by members of state and local government as well as homeless advocates to discuss the challenges and potential solutions to homelessness.
“People always tell you that homelessness is this simple thing to fix, and that you can take these cookie cutter approaches,” Scott said. “No — every single person experiencing homelessness needs a specific, tailored thing for them.”
More people aged 65+ face homelessness, state housing officials report

He said that investing in vacant housing efforts across the city, not just in downtown areas, will especially help underserved areas where people experience higher rates of poverty. He added that a partnership between the city, the Moore administration and private developers called Reframe Baltimore will bring in $3 billion over the next 15 years to eliminate vacant houses in the city.
But Scott assured the audience that there’s still work to be done.
Making progress, but challenges continue
Danielle Meister, assistant secretary of homeless solutions with the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, said  there has been a 28% decrease in homelessness across the state since 2015.
There’s also been a 42% drop in unsheltered homelessness since 2015, she said. Meister attributes that drop to the state’s adoption of “housing first” policies.
“Rather than requiring people to first go through treatment or first get a job to kind of earn housing,” she said, “we really endorse and fiercely protect the idea that they should be connecting people rapidly to permanent housing with the supports to stay there successfully.
“It’s really hard to get a job, it’s really hard to maintain sobriety if you don’t have a regular consistent place to live,” she added.
But even with that progress, there are a few populations where state data shows “really concerning trends” particularly with people aged 65 years and older and among families with children.
Meister said the number of homeless seniors doubled between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2024.
“The vast majority of the homeless system resources, they’re set up for people who can work and eventually, maybe, pay their own rent,” Meister said. “Most of our homeless system is not equipped to serve older adults who are on restricted income.”
She added that there’s been a “big increase” in families experiencing homelessness since the pandemic.
“It looks different than single adults, so what we’re going to start to focus on a little bit more is family homelessness,” she said.

Meister said that looking at trends in state data on homelessness can help identify and target new solutions.
“Generally, our state has been really great at accelerating permanent, supportive housing growth, not so much on other housing interventions which is more often navigated to families.”
Nick Rinehart, legislative analyst for the Howard County Council, asked the panel how officials can counter the stigma of homelessness to help push solutions in their jurisdictions.
“We’re elected to do the right thing, not the popular one,” Scott said. “We have to educate folks … but sometimes, they’re still going to be mad – so what?
“We have to be able to do what we know is right,” Scott said. “We just have to do the right thing no matter who gets mad.”

Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who retired last year. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)The message was the same, but the messenger was different.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md) held his first town hall as Maryland’s senior senator at the Maryland Association of Counties conference Friday, stepping into a role long held by former Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who retired last year. Once on the stage, Van Hollen gave a presentation that could have been delivered by Cardin in any of the past few years, criticizing President Donald Trump’s administration in general and vowing to bring the new FBI headquarters to Greenbelt, the Democratic equivalent of political comfort food.
Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy kicked off the question-and-answer portion by bringing up the FBI headquarters and asking what county officials can do to “protect Maryland and protect Maryland assets” from sudden decisions at the federal level.
Van Hollen reminded the audience that the original decision to place the FBI headquarters in Greenbelt was made after years of study and competition between Maryland and Virginia. But in March, Trump said he would scrap plans for a new headquarters in Maryland because he wanted to keep the agency in Washington, D.C.
In July, FBI Director Kash Patel announced that the agency would be moving just a few blocks from its current home on Pennsylvania Avenue, to space in the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, to space that had been occupied by the Agency for International Development before Trump abruptly closed that agency this year.
But Van Hollen, like most of the Maryland Democratic establishment, said Patel’s announcement is not the last word. “This is a fight that is going to go on, and we are going to bring the FBI headquarters to Prince George’s County,” he told the town hall crowd.
“Regardless of party,” Van Hollen said, “I think officials recognize that it’s not helpful when they’ve been able to secure a federal grant or a federal program or federal program supports — only to see it frozen or terminated.”

“Unfortunately, this is going back and forth, seesawing back and forth as we speak,” he said. “Congress has spoken on this on a bipartisan basis. We had hoped more of our Republican colleagues would stand with us.”
Getting Republicans to stand against Trump policies and find bipartisan solutions was Van Hollen’s answer to several concerns raised by elected officials and advocates in the town hall Friday – such as immigration reform, cuts to disaster relief programs and the erosion of trust in federal data and reporting.
“We need our Republican counterparts to meet their constitutional responsibilities,” Van Hollen said after the town hall. “When you have a Republican Party on Capitol Hill that is 100% in league with the president and not willing to challenge the president … this is a problem.”
Getting charged up over energy policy
What is it about energy policy that gets people a little fired up?
At a Maryland Association of Counties session “Powering Maryland: What’s Next for the State’s Energy Future?” on Thursday, Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul Pinsky took aim at PJM Interconnection, the operator of the regional electric grid that supplies power to Maryland and all or parts of about a dozen other states.
Problem is, PJM was sitting right there, in the person of Executive Director Jason Stanek, a former Maryland Public Service Commission chairman.
The exchange began with Stanek’s description of PJM as a “fuel-neutral … nonpartisan” organization.
“We don’t build generation. We don’t build transmission. We don’t own generation, and we don’t own transmission,” Stanek said. “Unlike most utilities, we have no shareholders, we have no share price, and we don’t make a penny in profit.”
Pinsky, who stepped to the microphone after Stanek, saw an opening. He argued that the majority of PJM’s grid is served by fossil fuels and a logjammed queue to join the grid is full of renewable energy projects, including solar farms and battery storage projects.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“You can be fuel-neutral, but if your policies help fossil fuels, you’re not fuel-neutral,” Pinsky said, as Stanek shook his head.
Pinsky said that although PJM was built to help states move electrons from one area to another, the current structure doesn’t provide state governments ample representation.
“On the Board of Governors, there is no one who represents the states. Are there people who represent the generators of the power? Yes. Are there people who are close to the utilities that move the power? You bet,” Pinsky said.
Stanek didn’t get the microphone to respond right away, but then came a question from an attendee who wondered if there was a way to ensure that energy generated in Maryland stays in Maryland for local consumption. Stanek defended the PJM model.
“The advantages of having a large, interconnected grid is that you have the economies of scale,” Stanek said. “You can ship your power throughout the grid to obtain the most efficient, best price. To the extent you want to island the grid and make it smaller, you’ll obviously have less options, less resources.”
Medicaid director makes MACo debut
Vacancies at the Maryland Department of Health are starting to get filled after a series of departures by high-level officials of the agency.
Just Monday, Perrie Briskin began her tenure as the Deputy Secretary for Healthcare Financing and Medicaid Director, filling the place of Ryan Moran, who left the position last week for a state job in Washington.

And Friday, Briskin was a key speaker on a MACo panel talking about how the recent budget reconciliation bill passed by Congress will impact Medicaid coverage in the state.
“When we talk about federal cuts, that is a huge cut to the overall funding Medicaid budget, because of the disproportionately high share we receive from the federal government to run the program,” she told the audience, as part of a 10-minute overview of how Medicaid operates in Maryland.
“One cut to one part of Medicaid is a cut to all of Medicaid, so we are going to do our best to advocate for the program and to make sure we keep everyone covered, but we appreciate your partnership and want to work with all of you to do the same thing,” she said.
While she’s new to the position of deputy secretary, she has been with department since January, serving as the Chief of Staff for Maryland Medicaid. Prior to that, she was the Senior Advisor to the Director of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program Services at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
As the Medicaid director, Briskin will be tasked with helping see the state through implementation of work requirements for Medicaid as well as significant cuts to the program in the coming years.

Joni Ernst, right, as well as other Republican lawmakers. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)AMES, IOWA — U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Thursday during a visit to Ames National Laboratory that he supports the development and research of clean energy sources — but also said he believes the ending of some federal supports for industries like solar and wind energy has come at the right time.
Several parts of the budget reconciliation law signed by President Donald Trump change clean energy programs created through the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the flagship legislation of former President Joe Biden. The “big, beautiful” law takes funding out of some of these programs, in addition to ending or phasing out clean energy tax credits, shortening the qualification window for wind and solar projects and terminating rebates this year for purchase of electric vehicles and energy efficient home upgrades.
Nearly 60% of Iowa’s net electricity generation comes from wind energy, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Advocates for clean energy say Iowa, which has a higher share of wind energy production than other states and hosts a growing solar energy industry, could see higher costs and the loss of new projects, jobs and manufacturing facilities as these federal incentives end.
But Wright told reporters he supported the move to end these incentives, saying the industry has grown enough to be able to compete without the government financial support.
“I think it’s the right time to sunset them,” Wright said. “… In an early energy producing industry, the government provides subsidies or incentives or whatever to do it. But they’ve been around for 33 years, and I think you’ve seen a mature industry develop. So like with any energy source, it’s got to achieve maturity and compete in the marketplace.”
Wright was joined by members of Iowa’s federal delegation, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, as well as other members of the conservative climate caucus in the U.S. House, Reps. Bob Latta of Ohio and Bruce Westerman of Arkansas.
Ernst said discussions are ongoing with the Trump administration and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on wind projects in Iowa “to make sure that they do qualify for those tax credits.”
“It doesn’t mean our wind energy is going away. It just means that those tax credits will be phased out,” Ernst said. “So I can anticipate that states like Iowa, we will continue to see a great pull of electricity coming from those wind turbines, the solar projects that are there, but we will see less subsidies coming from the federal government.”
Wright also spoke in support of other components of the budget reconciliation law, saying the measure included some changes to permitting that “took some shackles off” on building new energy production infrastructure, as well as for natural resource extraction within the country.
The Ames National Laboratory, located on the Iowa State University campus, is one of the 17 national laboratories throughout the country that focus on research related to energy production, national security and environmental impact. The Ames lab focuses on issues related to materials science and minerals — areas of research Wright said are vital, as the nation needs to become less dependent on countries like China.
Currently, he said, the U.S. is over-reliant on foreign countries for certain chemicals and minerals that are needed in many energy, technology and medical fields.
Miller-Meeks said bringing the mining of minerals back to the U.S. — as well as setting up more processing and manufacturing industries for these natural resources in the U.S. — would be more environmentally conscious overall, as there are “better labor practices, better environmental practices” in the U.S. than in other countries.
There are also methods being developed at facilities like the Ames National Laboratory to remine rare earth elements and other materials through recycled electronic waste, Miller-Meeks said.
Wright said while there were cuts made through the budget reconciliation law and other efforts by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress to cut costs, he said he does not expect cuts to the National Laboratory system.
“Of course, when I got there, the original idea was, ‘Let’s cut everything, let’s shrink everything,’” Wright said. “We need to shrink our spending of the government. But the smallest — and potentially no cuts — will be to the broader national laboratory complex. These are investments in our future. They’re much smaller dollars than giant corporate subsidies, and they have huge payoffs.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)President Donald Trump’s high-profile meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin adjourned their brief summit Friday without announcing a breakthrough in negotiations to end Russia’s three-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
“We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there,” Trump said after several hours of closed-door negotiations with Putin in Anchorage.
The talks ended sooner than previously expected, indicating that the two leaders may be far apart.
In a pair of brief speeches, the leaders said they were optimistic about improvements in relations between the United States and Russia. Putin said they had reached “an agreement,” according to a provided translation, but neither Putin nor Trump provided any details about what that agreement entails.
Before the meeting, Trump had indicated that he might favor a land exchange between Russia and Ukraine as part of a peace deal. European leaders, including Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said they did not support any deal that would require Ukraine to surrender territory.
“We had an extremely productive meeting, and many points were agreed to,” Trump said Friday without explaining what those points were. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”
During a planned news conference, Putin spoke for only eight minutes, and Trump, who normally delivers lengthy and meandering remarks, spoke for only four and appeared tired.
Both men then left without taking any questions from a room full of international journalists, an action that stunned and confused attendees.
Many of those journalists, as well as Putin, Trump and officials from both Russia and the United States, traveled thousands of miles to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a base operated by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city.
Because of the summit’s short notice — Trump announced it on social media just one week ago — the city’s hotel rooms were all but sold out, and rental cars were almost impossible to find.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, members of the Russian delegation, including journalists, were given cots in curtained-off spaces within Alaska Airlines Arena.
En route to Alaska, Trump told reporters traveling aboard Air Force One that he was “not going to be happy” if there was no ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine by the end of the day, according to news reports.
He said he didn’t know what would make the summit a success and said there was “nothing set in stone.”
As originally announced, Trump and Putin were supposed to meet in a one-on-one meeting Friday morning. That changed to a three-on-three, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff, joining Trump.
The change didn’t appear to result in even a temporary ceasefire in Ukraine, whose leaders were not invited to Alaska.
Ahead of the Trump-Putin meeting, disgruntled Alaskans held protests across the state, waving Ukrainian flags and urging the United States to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia.
A smaller counterprotest in support of the president, hosted by Alaska Republicans, took place just as Air Force One landed in Alaska about 11 a.m. Friday morning.
A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in advance of the meeting indicated that 86% of Alaskans hold negative views of Vladimir Putin and that Trump’s approval rating has dipped below 50% in Alaska, where voters have chosen Trump in the past three presidential elections.
About 30 minutes after Trump’s arrival, Putin’s plane landed at the Anchorage military base after a stop in Magadan, in the Russian Far East.
Trump disembarked first and greeted Putin with applause and a firm handshake before inviting the Russian leader into the presidential limousine.
Putin’s arrival in the United States represented a kind of diplomatic victory for the Russian leader, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court and faces arrest if he visits many countries, including most in Europe. The Trump administration opposes the ICC and does not typically enforce its arrest warrants.
Additionally, Trump has declined to impose additional financial and economic sanctions on Russia and Russian officials, something he had pledged to do if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.
Eric Croft, chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, said in a written statement, “Just as we expected, Trump failed to accomplish anything meaningful by inviting a war criminal to a meeting on American soil without Ukrainian representation at the table. … To be frank, we are disappointed, but not surprised, and we will not back down from applying pressure to Trump to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.”
On Friday, Putin and Trump, accompanied by aides, talked for at least 2 ½ hours. The content of those discussions was not revealed.
Putin boarded his plane for a return flight about 4 p.m. Trump was scheduled to depart before 6 p.m.
Their original schedule had called for more lengthy discussions, but reporters were called to a news conference sooner than expected.
That appeared to be in line with remarks Trump gave the day before, in the Oval Office.
“I would say that (on Friday), all I want to do is set the table for the next meeting, which should happen shortly,” Trump said on Thursday. “I’d like to see it happen very quickly, very shortly after this meeting. I’d like to see it actually happen in Alaska … because it’s so much easier.”
On Friday, Putin delivered his remarks mostly in Russian but joked in English that maybe next time, they could meet in Moscow.
Trump said he would “get a little heat” if he agreed to that, “but I could see it possibly happening.”
Even without a breakthrough peace deal, Friday’s meeting between the two presidents was a historic one. It was the first time since Ronald Reagan met Pope John Paul II in Fairbanks that an American president had hosted a foreign leader in Alaska.
Before Friday, no Russian leader had ever visited Alaska — a place whose territory nominally belonged to Russia from the 1700s until 1867.

A group of education leaders is working to reshape Washington’s system of funding for K-12 education after years of financial challenges plaguing school districts.
Two Whatcom County superintendents are taking part. Meridian Superintendent James Everett and Ferndale Superintendent Kristi Dominguez are participating with the group, which was formed by Yakima Superintendent Trevor Greene and Bellevue Superintendent Kelly Aramaki last summer.
“We know that there’s a problem, and we can continue to admire it, and talk about it, or we can sit down and say, ‘This isn’t working,’” Dominguez said.
The catalyst for the formation of the group was Aramaki’s experience having to make massive budget cuts over the last several years, according to Seattle Times reporting. Bellevue is now on binding conditions with the state, joining seven other districts (including Mount Baker) receiving financial oversight from the state due to serious budgetary challenges.
That demonstrates the breadth of the problem, the superintendents say. And it doesn’t even include the many more districts that are enduring massive cuts to avoid financial oversight by the state, including Blaine, Bellingham and more. Ferndale eliminated $6 million in expenses from its budget this year. Meridian eliminated $1 million this year and $2 million the year before.
For Dominguez and Everett, it’s clear the current funding model isn’t working.
“There’s something broken in the system,” Dominguez said. “So we’re just asking, what new system do we need to explore?”
The main issue, they say, is that the state doesn’t come close to funding what the schools must pay for. As costs and student needs have increased, funding hasn’t kept up.
The superintendents were initially pulled from the University of Washington alumni network but have since expanded to more than 20 superintendents across the state. They’re working with the University of Washington College of Education, including Dean Mia Tuan, Professor Anthony Craig and Professor David Knight.
Washington funds schools under a system called a “resource funding model,” which bases allocations on a series of student-staff ratios, according to research by Knight.
Many other states, however, follow a student-based approach. Under that system, districts receive a base amount of funding per student, with additional funding designated for students who are low-income, multi-language learners or need specific support services. Then, that is multiplied by district enrollment to determine how much money the district gets from the state.
Dominguez simplified the system as “the money follows the adults” in Washington, while it follows the students in other states.
An example of how that plays out in local districts: The state pays for Ferndale to hire seven paraeducators across the whole district. But in the 4,600-student district, “we need far more than that just to cover lunch duties, before or after school, playgrounds,” Dominguez said. In Meridian School District, the state pays for half a nurse, Everett said.
Despite the funding issues, schools must continue to meet the needs of students, and they are “working their butts off” to do so, Everett said. But it’s with less and less funding.
The way local levies are set up causes issues, too.
“The higher assessed value of property that you have, the better ability you have to secure funding with less impact on your community,” Everett said.
While districts like Seattle can run levies that bring in hundreds of millions of dollars at a modest cost to the individual taxpayer, property-poor districts must have higher tax rates to bring in much less.
It’s created competing agendas between property-rich and property-poor districts. But the intention is to come up with a proposal that works for everyone, Everett said.
Everett said his biggest takeaway from the experience was that no district has it figured out — even areas with high levels of assessed value, such as Bellevue.
By their next meeting in October, the plan is to come up with a specific proposal they want to push forward, Everett said.
“We are now at crisis level in many ways, and it’s our kids who are going to pay the price,” Dominguez said. “… At what point do we just say, enough? We’ve got to get proactive.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)As South Dakota lawmakers consider spending $650 million to build a prison, another major building expense is looming: the first full restoration of the state Capitol in nearly 40 years.
The state official in charge of planning the restoration is Darin Seeley, commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources and Administration. When he briefed a committee of legislators during a public meeting Tuesday at the Capitol, one of them asked for a ballpark estimate of the cost.
Seeley stressed that he does not have an official number yet. “But,” he said, “we’re talking probably between $150 million and $200 million.”

South Dakota is in a tight budget climate while the Trump administration and Congress reduce support for states. The governor’s budget office says various state departments have already lost a combined $24 million in federal funding since Trump’s second term began.
That’s a reversal from the latter part of Trump’s first term and the Biden years, when South Dakota’s budget benefited from pandemic aid and stimulus funding. Lawmakers set aside enough money during those years that they should be able to build a men’s prison without taking on any debt, if they approve the plan during a Sept. 23 special legislative session. The new prison — which would be built on undeveloped land in northeast Sioux Falls — would replace the oldest parts of the pre-statehood penitentiary.
The lawmaker who asked Seeley for a ballpark estimate on the Capitol project is state Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, a Republican from Sioux Falls. 
“That number itself is a tremendously huge number,” Karr said afterward in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight. “I look forward to getting some more data and facts.”
No savings have been set aside yet for a full Capitol restoration. But lawmakers have provided about $12 million in the last six years to study problems afflicting the Capitol, along with its lake and its grounds, and to make temporary repairs while planning for a larger project. 
Lake studied
So far, that work has included studying the condition of the 115-year-old, 1,300-feet-deep well feeding Capitol Lake. The well formerly produced natural gas in addition to water, and for many years the gas was lit to create a flaming fountain. The gas flow began to diminish about 20 years ago and can no longer sustain a flame.

A study in 2019 determined that the well could be compromised, and that a collapse could cause an uncontrolled flow of water to surface wherever it finds a pathway. A follow-up study that included sending a camera down the well determined it was in better shape than originally feared, and “a new water source for Capitol Lake is not the emergency that we had been led to believe,” Seeley told lawmakers. 
Discussion continues about a replacement water source, but it’s been pushed down the priority list. Meanwhile, the lake has been dredged.
Roof repaired
The Capitol’s roof was repaired recently, although not without problems. Lawmakers learned Tuesday that while the roof was undergoing work, heavy rains in May and June leaked into the technology equipment closets that serve the House of Representatives chamber. 
About $185,000 of damage was done, which will hopefully be covered by insurance. It’s unlikely new equipment will be in place by next month’s special session, meaning some House members’ voting buttons might not work, and the electronic display for voting results might be inoperable. The Legislative Research Council is preparing workarounds.
Plaster repair, rotunda restoration
The next project targets numerous areas of damaged plaster for repair, which Seeley hopes to finish before the start of the annual legislative session in January.
“We’re going to make it look right in the short run, in places where it’s the worst today,” he said.

After that, Seeley plans a rotunda restoration to begin after the 2026 legislative session and be completed by the 2027 session. A company specializing in historic restoration will try to recapture the rotunda’s original beauty, which Seeley said is dimmed by aging paint and plaster, and poor lighting.
While all of that is happening, Seeley hopes to work with the Capitol Complex Restoration and Beautification Commission — a bipartisan group of seven people appointed by the governor — on a full restoration plan. The last full restoration was completed for the 1989 statehood centennial celebration, he said. 
The needs are many. Nearly every communication system that’s ever been installed in the Capitol is still in the building. The steam heating system needs a replacement. Some of the plumbing is more than 100 years old. Roof drains that run inside the walls need attention.
There was no discussion Tuesday about how to pay for it all. Karr said that discussion should start soon.

NEW HAVEN — Hyla Howe trudged through the high grass. She scanned the ground and took note: red clover, sedge, canary reed. Each plant said something about whether the field would be a good spot for bobolinks. 
Suddenly came a wave of R2-D2 chirps as 40 or more the birds were flushed from their positions in the grass, swirling through the air singing. 
“This is amazing!” Howe said.
The birds looked like dots dancing overhead. The fledglings were easy to spot in their clumsier flight patterns, and with binoculars, the adult males were clear in their distinctive black and white plumage, the adult females sporting brown feathers with yellow breasts.  
After a few transects of the field, it was time to go back to the landowner to tell them the good news: The birds had successfully nested, and it was safe to mow.
That’s a day in the life of Howe, hired this year as the first outreach coordinator for the Boboblink Project, an effort run by Mass Audubon, Audubon Vermont and New Hampshire Audubon. She works for the Massachusetts outfit specifically.
Grassland birds like the bobolink are declining faster than any other group of birds in New England. In the last 50 years, over 75% of the species have seen population losses. Some of the worst hit are bobolinks and eastern meadowlarks, two of 10 species of grassland birds in Vermont. They build their nests on the ground, which makes them vulnerable to haying and mowing in fields. 
The Bobolink Project pays the owners of these fields, often farmers, to conduct or pay for bird-friendly management practices. The birds get time and habitat to nest while the landowners get some compensation for letting them do so.

The money to pay participating landowners comes from private donations.
“You don’t think of wildlife as an agricultural product until you remove native prairie, then you kind of have to think about wildlife as an agricultural product,” said Howe. “Essentially, the landowners are raising grassland birds.”
On Howe’s early morning visit to New Haven, landowner Steve Shores was thrilled to hear about the successful nests.
“I am glad you are seeing birds in these fields,” Shores said.
After a catch-up about the farm, life and all its changes, Howe and Shores said goodbye until next year, when she’ll come back to check on the field again.
Every current or prospective piece of land in the project needs to be surveyed yearly. 
To be a part of the effort, farmers must alter their haying processes. 
That’s done by either delaying the first cut of the season — no disturbance in the field until after July 15 — or delaying a second cut — no disturbance in the field between May 20 and July 24. The delays allow enough time for grassland birds to nest safely.
The birds need enough space as well as enough cover to protect their hatchlings until they are able to fly. 
To get their population estimates, scientists have been out surveying fields, which includes analyzing vegetation and counting female birds to estimate the number of nests in the area using a formula created by Allan Strong, a University of Vermont professor who directs the school’s wildlife and fisheries biology program. 
The biggest driver of grassland bird declines has been changes in land use.

The first major land-use transformation affecting grassland bird populations in Vermont today was the demise of sheep farming starting in the 19th century. 
Vermont’s sheep boom started in 1811 and lasted until the middle of the century. By 1840 there were over a million sheep in the state, requiring an enormous amount of pasture.
Two hundred years later, the landscape of Vermont is nearly 80% forest: Many of the sheep farms were left to fallow and have reforested since. The dairy farms that came in after the sheep craze required less open land — and themselves have declined since. 
When farms go out of business and no one’s around to maintain the fields, shrubs and tree seedlings start to take over.
As trees reemerged in disused land, there were less and less grasslands where birds such as the bobolink could build their nests.
The second land-use factor causing grassland bird decline is the intensified management of fields. 
“Fields are being cut earlier than they used to, more frequently than they used to,” Strong said.
“Bobolinks and meadowlarks don’t really have a chance,” he said.
More than 95% of eastern meadowlarks have disappeared in New England, according to the Vermont Center for Ecostudies, and it’s now a threatened species. Bobolink populations have dropped 60-75% continent-wide.
“There are fields I’m seeing now with fewer and fewer boblinks,” said Margaret Fowle, senior conservationist at the Vermont Audubon.
The Mass Audubon hired Howe to manage the Bobolink Project, do more targeted outreach to farmers and provide more opportunities for education and assistance.
The landowners engaging in the Bobolink Project are excited to help conserve the birds while also getting some money for their participation.
“They pay me not to mow, and I don’t mow anyway, so why not get a little money and save the birds?” said Shores, the New Haven farmer.
He was contacted by the project to consider entering his field into conservation.
Marilyn Marks, a prospective participant who lives down the road from Shores, said she wishes the state would provide landowners a tax credit for maintaining their fields for conservation — expanding a current credit system that cuts rates for land deemed for agricultural use.

The effort is not without drawbacks. Delayed cutting of fields could allow invasive plant species to seed.
According to Fowle, invasives such as poison parsnip, bedstraw and spotted knackweed have been moving into these grasslands.
“Fields abandoned, left to fallow, will over time become meadows and then forest in Vermont. It’s a common misconception that fields should be left completely alone,” said Howe
Kevin Tolan, staff biologist at Vermont Center for Ecostudies, sees it as a catch-22. “Can’t cut too much because it’ll destroy their nests,” he said. “Otherwise, if you let the invasives seed, they can take over.”
Howe, as the outreach coordinator responsible for surveying the fields, has been spending the season so far meeting with farmers and landowners and checking the viability of their fields for nests.
Viability of the fields is checked by a few different measures. When walking through the fields, Howe takes note of vegetation, management practices and looks out for birds. 
The vegetation is important to pay attention to since it can reveal habitat quality. For example, an overabundance of sedges indicates that the field may be too wet for bobolinks to nest on the ground. 
And if grass is not dense enough, it puts the bird nests at risk for predation.
Howe thinks of grassland systems in a similar way to forests, with canopies, understories and overstories. The arrangement of cover needs to be right for bobolinks and their hatchlings to succeed.
“It’s like an interesting puzzle,” she said.

(Natalie Behring/Getty Images)As conservative lawmakers work to restrict online access to abortion medication, a new report shows how popular it has become for women who live in states that have outlawed abortion.
Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin led a team that analyzed 15 months of prescription data from Aid Access, one of the largest online abortion telemedicine providers.
They found 84% of Aid Access’s more than 118,000 online prescriptions went to patients living in abortion-ban states.
The South and Midwest had the highest rates of patients accessing telemedicine abortion. Rates were also greater in high-poverty areas or where people would have to travel more than 100 miles to reach an abortion clinic, according to the report, which published this month.
Aid Access is able to mail abortion medications to residents in all 50 states — even those in states with abortion bans — thanks to shield laws in Democratic-led states. Shield laws are designed to minimize the legal risks for people who provide or access abortions across state lines.
Currently, 22 states and Washington, D.C., have reproductive care shield laws, either through legislation or by executive order, according to a report from University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
Eight of those states — California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington — specifically protect telehealth abortion providers regardless of where their patient is located.
Idaho is losing OB-GYNs. Doctors who remain are trying to shoulder the extra burdens.

Shield laws, along with difficulty accessing in-person abortion services in abortion-ban states, have contributed to a rise in medication and telehealth abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion in 2022, clearing the way for state bans. With telehealth abortion, patients have a virtual appointment with a clinician who can prescribe abortion medication, which is then filled by a licensed pharmacy and mailed to the patient.
Research has shown telehealth medication abortion is effective and safe, and comparable to in-person medication abortion.
Medication abortion accounted for nearly two-thirds of all clinician-provided abortions in states without bans in 2023, the most recent data available from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
But as abortion medication use rises, so have conservative efforts to ban it.
This year, more than a dozen states introduced bills to bar access to medication abortion by criminalizing its sale, purchase or distribution, according to Guttmacher.
One such bill in Texas, which could have been a blueprint for medication abortion restriction in other states, was specifically aimed at groups like Aid Access. It would have allowed private citizens to sue for at least $100,000 anyone who provided abortion pills in Texas. The bill passed the Texas Senate but died in the House in May.
Earlier this year, the state of Louisiana criminally charged a New York physician under its abortion ban law for allegedly providing abortion pills to a Louisiana teen via telehealth. New York, which passed a shield law in 2023, refused Louisiana’s request to extradite the doctor.
Last month marked the first federal test of shield laws, when a Texas man sued a California doctor for allegedly mailing abortion pills to his partner.
This week, a Texas woman filed a federal lawsuit against Aid Access and against a man who she said impregnated her, then spiked her drink with abortion pills. She is also suing the Dutch doctor who founded Aid Access, alleging Aid Access and its founder mailed abortion-inducing drugs in violation of Texas and federal law.

But Democratic critics and data experts warn it could allow the federal government to vacuum up vast quantities of information on Americans for unclear purposes.
Some Democratic election officials and opponents of the effort fear President Donald Trump wants to build a federal database of voters to target political opponents or cherry-pick rare examples of noncitizen voters to fuel a sense of crisis. Republican election officials allied with the president counter that he’s helping states to maintain accurate voter rolls.
The Trump administration has rolled out changes to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, tool at the same time the U.S. Department of Justice is asking states for copies of their voter rolls. The timing, combined with questions about what happens to voter data uploaded to the program, has alarmed critics.
Trump wants Congress to pass a national proof of citizenship voter registration requirement and in March tried to unilaterally impose one for federal elections through executive order. But with the legislation stalled and the order halted by the courts, the citizenship data tool may offer a backdoor way to accomplish the same goal.
SAVE was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, this spring refashioned it into a platform that can scan states’ voter rolls if election officials upload the data.

The changes to SAVE, rolled out over just a few months and with little public debate, are “tinkering with sort of the bones of democracy,” said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
“You’re talking about the voting process and who will be eligible to vote,” Davisson said. “And to take a system that is not designed for use in that process and repurpose it, really on the fly, without a formal comment process, without formal rulemaking, without congressional intervention — that’s pretty anomalous and pretty alarming.”
Previously, SAVE could only search one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing state officials to potentially feed into it information on millions of registered voters. SAVE checks that information against a series of federal databases and reports back whether it can verify someone’s immigration status.
Since May, it also can draw upon Social Security data, transforming the program into a tool that can confirm citizenship because Social Security records for many, but not all, Americans include the information. NPR reported earlier on changes to SAVE.
“It is incredible what has been done, really since March,” Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray, a Republican who supports proof of citizenship requirements and the SAVE tool, told a gathering of state secretaries of state in Biloxi, Mississippi, last week.
Individuals registering to vote in federal elections must already sign a statement affirming they are citizens under penalty of perjury, and those who cast a ballot face criminal penalties and deportation. One study of the 2016 election placed the prevalence of noncitizen voting at 0.0001% of votes cast.
But as Trump has spread falsehoods about elections, Republicans have made purging noncitizens from voter rolls a central focus.

Democratic concerns were on display last week at the National Association of Secretaries of State conference, held at the Beau Rivage casino-resort in Biloxi. In interviews on the sidelines of the conference, Democratic secretaries of state voiced deep reservations — or outright opposition — about plugging their voter data into SAVE.
Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Aug. 6 that the federal government appeared to be trying to take over election administration. She formally rejected the Justice Department’s voter roll request two days later.
Bellows said the Department of Homeland Security told her in a recent phone call that it planned to retain SAVE data for 10 years for “audit purposes only.”
“Just like the [Justice Department] is asking us to hand over an electronic file of all the voters in our state, it seems like the Department of Homeland Security is through this backdoor system also asking us to share voter information about every voter in our state,” Bellows said.
At least one state appears to have granted the federal government sweeping authority over any voter data it provides to SAVE.
Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced in July he had reached an agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to access the newly expanded system for voter list maintenance. Indiana’s agreement allows the federal agency to use information the state provides for any purpose permitted by law, including criminal prosecutions.
Morales, a Republican, said in a news release that SAVE represented “another step in safeguarding the rights” of eligible voters. His office didn’t respond to Stateline’s questions.
The Trump administration has ramped up efforts to encourage state election officials to use the expanded program. The White House hosted a bipartisan “fly in” event for state secretaries of state on July 29. Multiple secretaries of state told Stateline that USCIS Director Joseph Edlow, who was confirmed on July 15, spoke at the event.
“The president is very much keyed in on voter list maintenance,” Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins, a Republican, said in an interview — echoing other GOP secretaries of state who released statements praising the Trump administration after the meeting.










When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances.


– Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon


Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat who attended the meeting, said he questioned how the federal government would handle voter information provided to SAVE. He added that the Justice Department’s request for his state’s voter rolls raised his level of concern about how data would be used.
“When we disclose information, particularly personal identifying information, we need to have a handle on how it’s going to be used, by whom and under what circumstances,” Simon told Stateline.
The White House referred questions about SAVE and the event to the Department of Homeland Security and USCIS.
In response to questions from Stateline, USCIS didn’t directly answer whether the agency would share voter roll data with other parts of the federal government but confirmed it disposes of records after 10 years.
“The SAVE application is a critical tool for state and local governments to access information to safeguard the integrity of elections across the country. It’s no wonder many states have quickly adopted it, and we continue to promote the tool to other states and counties not using SAVE,” USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.
“We look forward to continued optimization efforts and implementing more updates to SAVE.”
GOP pressure
Some Republican election officials and Trump allies have long wanted the federal government to take an expanded role in searching state voter rolls for noncitizens.
Last summer the Trump-aligned litigation group America First Legal, co-founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, encouraged states to submit to the Department of Homeland Security the names of individuals for citizenship or immigration status verification.
Some states did just that. Texas, for example, asked USCIS to verify the citizenship of some voters in September, and Indiana asked the agency to verify 585,774 voters in October. The same month, 16 Republican state attorneys general signed a letter criticizing Homeland Security, then under the Biden administration, for failing to work with states on verification.

After Trump took office, GOP state officials kept up the pressure. Twenty-one Republican secretaries of state urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in February to prioritize SAVE improvements.
On April 16, Indiana sued the department in federal court for not responding to its verification request last fall. USCIS announced an overhaul of SAVE less than a week later.
As the agency continues to remake SAVE, the tool will soon allow searches using the last four digits of a Social Security number, multiple state secretaries of state told Stateline. The agency confirmed the feature is under development and will be available soon but didn’t provide an exact date.
The change would mark another significant expansion of the program because most states collect the last four digits when individuals without a driver’s license register to vote.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said SAVE represents a better way to verify citizenship than a state law requiring voters to produce documents. “I think there’s a real opportunity for us to do a lot of this through just sharing of information and I think that’s what we’re seeing happen,” McGrane said in an interview.
Unreliable data?
But some voting rights advocates and experts on government data caution against an overreliance on Social Security data.
The Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, a progressive policy nonprofit, has noted that Social Security only began tracking the citizenship status of all applicants in 1978 — meaning the database doesn’t include comprehensive citizenship information for older Americans. Additionally, Social Security may not always have up-to-date information on the status of naturalized U.S. citizens.
The nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government also warned in May that since SAVE hasn’t used Social Security numbers to verify citizenship in the past, its accuracy and effectiveness are unknown. The success of the expanded SAVE program may also partially depend on whether it has adequate staff and resources, it said.
 

A 2017 Government Accountability Office report found that between fiscal years 2012 and 2016, about 16% of the nearly 90 million SAVE searches required additional verification, which the institute says often translates into federal workers manually checking files. Now that SAVE allows bulk searches, the need for manual checking could rise dramatically.
Nick Doctor, director of implementation at the Institute for Responsive Government, said in an interview that a tool confirming the eligibility of registered voters in a way that doesn’t burden individuals can be a good thing. But he emphasized that it depends in large measure on SAVE’s implementation.
“The changes that have been made to SAVE happened very quickly and, to my knowledge, we haven’t seen releases on the level of accuracy of that information,” Doctor said.
During interviews, Republican secretaries of state stressed that voters aren’t kicked off the rolls because SAVE can’t verify their citizenship. Instead, an inability to verify would likely trigger a follow-up process with the voter.
“Just because we get something back from the SAVE database, it’s not a cut and dry, especially on those they’re not sure about,” Hoskins, the Missouri secretary of state, said.
Still, Arizona illustrates why some Democrats worry about any large-scale effort to ask voters — especially longtime, older residents — to prove their citizenship. After the state discovered errors in how it tracked voter citizenship dating back years, election officials are contacting some 200,000 voters seeking proof of citizenship documentation.
Some have been casting ballots for decades without incident and many feel targeted, Arizona Democratic Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a presentation at the state secretaries of state conference. “They feel insulted when they get that letter,” Fontes said.










There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside.


– Charles Stewart III, MIT political scientists


Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies elections, said Arizona may actually point to the potential usefulness of SAVE. If Arizona runs its voter roll through the program, a list of 200,000 voters needing citizenship verification would perhaps drop into the hundreds, he suggested.
“There’s a lot of good-government reasons to believe that something like this, governed properly and governed with fail-safe mechanisms, could have an upside,” Stewart said.
Connecticut Democratic Secretary of State Stephanie Thomas told Stateline that every secretary wants tools to keep voter lists as clean as possible. But the details are important.
When she hears of something new, Thomas said she asks whether it’s the best option available and whether “the i’s are dotted, the t’s crossed.” She said she’s asked USCIS a series of questions about SAVE and is waiting on some responses.
“When it comes to voter lists,” Thomas said, “I don’t want Connecticut voters to be a guinea pig.”

The Trump administration and Harvard University are reportedly close to reaching a settlement that would require Harvard to pay US$500 million in exchange for the government releasing frozen federal funding and ending an investigation into antisemitism on campus.
This follows similar deals the White House struck with Columbia University and Brown University in July 2025. Both of those universities agreed to undertake campus reforms and pay a large sum – more than $200 million in the case of Columbia and $50 million for Brown – in order to receive federal funding that the Trump administration was withholding. The White House originally froze funding after saying that these universities had created unsafe environments for Jewish students during Palestinian rights protests on campus in 2024.
As a scholar of higher education politics, I examined the various deals the Trump administration made with some universities. When Harvard announces its deal, it will be informative to see what is different – or the same.
I believe the Columbia and Brown deals can be used as a blueprint for Trump’s plans for higher education. They show how the government wants to drive cultural reform on campus by giving the government more oversight over universities and imposing punishments for what it sees as previous wrongdoing.
Here are four key things to understand about the deals:
1. Antisemitism isn’t a major feature of the agreements
The Trump White House accused Brown and Columbia of tolerating antisemitism during campus protests. But the administration neither followed federal standards for investigating antisemitism, nor did it dictate specific reforms to protect Jewish students.
Ahead of its deal, Columbia in March 2025 adopted a new, broader definition of antisemitism that was created by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The United Nations and most European Union countries also use this definition.
Yet the school’s 22-page deal mentions antisemitism only once, where it says Columbia is required to hire an additional staff member to support Jewish students’ welfare.
Brown’s deal, meanwhile, did not involve the university adopting a particular definition of antisemitism. But Brown did commit to offering “research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in Judaic Studies.” Brown already hosts a Judaic Studies program, and it is unclear from the agreement’s text what additional measures are required.
The deals also extend well beyond antisemitism concerns and into questions of gender and the composition of student bodies.
Columbia agreed to provide “single-sex” housing and sports facilities, for example. The university has an optional Open Housing program that allows mixed-gender roommates and several gender-neutral restrooms.
This places the school in line with Donald Trump’s January executive order that says a person’s gender is based on their sex as assigned at birth.
Brown’s deal also requires single-sex sports and housing facilities. In addition, Brown committed to using definitions of men and women that match Trump’s executive order.
Columbia, which enrolls about 40% of its students from other countries, also agreed to “decrease financial dependence on international student enrollment.”
The Brown deal says nothing about international education.
2. Both deals are expensive but vague about financial details.
Columbia must pay a fine of more than $200 million to the federal government, while Brown will make $50 million in donations to Rhode Island workforce development programs.
In both cases, it is not clear where the money will go or how it will be used.
Congress passed The Clery Act in 1990, creating a legal framework for fining campuses that failed to protect students’ safety.
Since then, the government has reached different settlements with universities.
Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Virginia, was required to pay the federal government $14 million in 2024, for example, for failing to investigate sexual assault allegations.
But Columbia’s payment is far larger than any previous university and government settlement. Columbia will make three payments of about $66 million into the Treasury Department over three years, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education. But it isn’t clear how the money will exactly be spent and what will happen after those three years, The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in August 2025.
Only Congress can legally decide how to spend Treasury Department funds. But Trump has ignored Congress’ appropriation directives on a number of occasions.
Brown, meanwhile, will not pay the government anything. Instead, its deal will go “to state workforce development organizations operating in compliance with anti-discrimination laws, over the ten years.”
The Brown deal doesn’t say what qualifies as qualified workforce development organizations.
3. Trump wants to influence university admissions.
While the Brown and Columbia deals have several differences, the agreements have nearly identical language giving the Trump administration oversight of the way they admit students.
The deals say that the universities must provide the government with detailed information about who applied to the schools and was admitted, broken down by grades and test scores, as well as race and ethnicity. The government could then conduct a “comprehensive audit” of the schools, based on this information.
This information could also be used to determine if universities are showing a preferences for students of color. Without providing evidence, conservative activists have alleged that selective colleges discriminate against white people and that this is a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Experts have said that these reporting requirements appear to be intended to increase the number of white students admitted to Ivy League schools.
4. The deals could open more doors to federal intrusion.
Claire Shipman, Columbia’s acting president, said in July that the deal would allow the university’s “research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.”
Christina Paxson, Brown’s president, also defended the agreement in a statement, writing that it “enables us as a community to move forward after a period of considerable uncertainty in a way that ensures Brown will continue to be the Brown that our students, faculty, staff, alumni, parents and friends have known for generations.”
But the deals could invite more scrutiny from the federal government.
Both deals spell out the government’s right to open new investigations against Brown and Columbia, or to reopen old complaints if the administration is not satisfied with how the universities are implementing the agreement.
Trump is now pressuring Harvard, UCLA and other universities to strike deals, also based on similar antisemitism allegations.
The White House announced on Aug. 8 that it could seize the research patents, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, that Harvard holds. Since 1980, universities have been able to legally hold, and profit from, patents resulting from federally funded research.
The federal government has long influenced higher education through funding and regulation. But the government has never tried to dictate what happens on campus before now.
Higher education experts like me believe that political goals now drive the way the government approaches higher education. Some of Trump’s conservative allies are now urging the president to go even further, saying “we have every right to renegotiate the terms of the compact with the universities.”
Given these and other pressure tactics, academics who study the law and government warn that the university deals indicate encroaching authoritarianism.

Brad Little’s “Capital for a Day” event in Orofino, Idaho, about 25-30 participants including myself, mostly from Clearwater County, held a peaceful demonstration at the park in Orofino with signs showing our support for public schools, public lands, affordable health care, rural hospitals and our concerns about several other Idaho issues.
The governor began the event, held at the Best Western Lodge, by stating that he and his staff had come specifically to talk with Orofino residents, and asked those from other counties to refrain from asking questions. The attendees at the conference honored his request, and residents of Orofino, including myself, took the opportunity to express our concerns and questions.
I, and many other participants at the event, are extremely concerned about public education funding. We specifically oppose tax credits for private and religious school tuition and believe this issue is non-partisan in our rural communities where our public schools are so important. 
When I was given the opportunity to ask the governor about this topic, about 20 audience members stood up with me, holding up signs saying “Not a Dollar More” while others clapped. I reminded the governor that he had asked Idahoans to call and tell him whether to sign or veto bill House Bill 93, the tax credit bill, to use $50 million to fund private schools. The vast majority, 86% of the 32,366 callers, asked him to veto it, yet he signed the bill anyway. 
I also stated that “although the amount is capped at $50 million for 2026, in 2027  and beyond the annual cost could increase to nearly $339 million based on legislative action. These funds will go to private schools that can discriminate against students they do not have to accept, can ignore State Board of Education curriculum guidelines and state requirements for educator and administrator qualifications, and have no accountability to the public.”
My question for the governor was, “If the Idaho Legislature passes a bill to increase the amount of this tax credit, will you sign it?”
He started answering by saying, “I stated that I would sign the bill,” and began alluding to various factors that could affect his decision in the future.
Due to the commotion in the room, it was difficult to hear the governor’s response. I asked him again, “If the Legislature votes to increase the tax credit program next year, will you sign the bill?” The governor never did give me a definitive yes or no answer.
During the rest of the session, other participants brought up additional topics of concern in our state such as: lack of women’s health care and mental health professionals; problems with corporations buying privately owned trailer rental developments and doubling rental rates; new caregiver regulations that make it harder for parents and families with special needs loved ones to find caregivers; the poor condition of forest roads; questioning wildfire tactics and strategies; why local firefighters wouldn’t know about federal funding until October and more. 
Gov. Little, at times, came off as lacking compassion and sincerity in his responses to the questioners. He told one woman that the reason that it was hard to find good health care in Idaho, i.e. gynecologists and obstetricians, was because it wasn’t profitable for them to operate their businesses here. He did not appear to acknowledge the true reasons doctors are fleeing the state and new doctors are not coming here, making it more difficult for all women to get quality health care in Idaho.
A study published Thursday, by JAMA Network One, a division of the Journal of American Medical Association, reported that Idaho lost 35% of its doctors that practiced obstetrics. In total Idaho lost 94 of those doctors, out of 268, between August 2022 and December 2024, the study found. 
“These results provide a stark picture of a rapidly declining maternal health workforce in our state,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Edward Mceachern, stated.
The abortion ban in Idaho went into effect in 2022. Some OB-GYNs, including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, said publicly that they were leaving due to the ban. 
This study’s results, and the previous statements by medical experts, soundly contradict the governor’s response regarding women’s health care in Idaho.
Several other county residents stood and complained about the poor road conditions and near-impossible access into northern Clearwater County. The governor replied that the people that lived there knew that they were moving onto a dusty road, which to my ears, and many others, sounded like the timber industries’ operations and desires take priority over the citizens’ needs.
Giving priority to the wants and desires of big businesses, and other significant contributors to the state’s income revenue, appears to be more important to the governor than solving his constituents’ problems.
I am quite sure that Idahoans in Clearwater County share many of the same concerns as Idahoans throughout the state. Remember that all Idaho residents can contact Gov. Little (call 208-334-2100 or go to https://gov.idaho.gov/contact-us/) before the next legislative session begins. Like those of us in Orofino on July 24, all Idahoans can make their voices heard, explain their concerns and ask the governor how he plans to address them.

Kennedy Jr., the secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)It’s August, and parents and caregivers are frantically preparing their kids for a new school year by buying supplies, filling out forms and meeting teachers. This year, many parents also face a question that’s more complicated than usual: Should my child get an updated COVID-19 vaccine, and will I even have that choice? For some, that decision may have already been made by chaotic federal policy, just as COVID-19 cases are rising nationwide.
As a pediatrician and researcher who studies vaccine delivery and health policy, I am hearing uncertainty from both parents and health care providers. If that describes you, you are not alone. A poll published Aug. 1, 2025, by the health policy organization KFF found half of parents are unsure whether federal health agencies are recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children this fall.
The process that normally provides clear, consistent recommendations and ensures availability for vaccines before respiratory virus season has been upended, and this year’s COVID-19 vaccine guidance for children is a prime example.
 
How the process typically works
For over two decades, there was a predictable, well-coordinated process to ensure recommended seasonal vaccines, such as the flu shot, were available for anyone who wanted them by early fall. In recent years, COVID-19 vaccines have been incorporated into this same annual cycle.
Beginning in February, the Food and Drug Administration, including its independent committee of experts, reviewed data and approved the optimal formulation. After FDA approval, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, an independent panel of experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reviewed the evidence in public meetings and issued clear recommendations.
Manufacturers then scaled up production; insurers confirmed coverage, which is tied to the advisory committee’s recommendations; and doses were distributed nationwide so vaccines would be available in clinics and pharmacies before the leaves started turning. This usual series of steps ensured that guidance incorporated input from scientists, epidemiologists, public health experts, clinicians, manufacturers, insurers and consumers. It also fostered trust among health care providers and, in turn, provided parents with clarity and confidence when making decisions
 
What’s different this year

	
Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took over as secretary of Health and Human Services in February 2025, that usual, tightly choreographed dance has become a chaotic scramble marked by uncertainty and a lack of transparency. Decisions about vaccine guidance have been made through internal channels without the same level of public discussion, review of the evidence or broad stakeholder input.
In May 2025, Kennedy and FDA leadership bypassed the agency’s independent review committee and announced that some COVID-19 vaccines would be approved only for children with high-risk conditions. One formulation has yet to be FDA-approved for children at all. The secretary first announced updated recommendations for children on X, stating COVID-19 vaccines would no longer be recommended for healthy children. Shortly after, the CDC posted guidelines that differed from that announcement and said healthy children “may” receive them. Meanwhile, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was disbanded by Kennedy and replaced with a smaller, hand-picked panel that operates with less transparency and has yet to weigh in on COVID-19 vaccines for children.
Public messaging has added to the confusion. Statements from newly appointed federal health leaders have questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and the long-standing processes for ensuring their safety. Funding for mRNA technology, which supports several COVID-19 vaccines and is being explored for use against other diseases and even some cancers, has been cut. And many of the claims used to justify these actions have been challenged by experts as inaccurate or misleading.
 
What this means for parents
For parents, the result is uncertainty about whether their children should be vaccinated, when and where the vaccines will be available, whether insurance will cover them, or whether their choice has effectively been made for them by newly appointed health leaders operating outside the guardrails of the normal vetting process. This uncertainty comes at a time when the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in children is already lower than that of other routine vaccines.

Currently, CDC guidelines say healthy children six months and older “may” receive a COVID-19 vaccine based on shared decision-making with their health care provider. The CDC recommends that children who are moderately or severely immunocompromised receive it. These guidelines differ from FDA approvals and Kennedy’s guidelines announced on X, and they have not been reviewed or voted on in an advisory committee on immunization practices meeting.
Parents can start by talking with their child’s pediatrician about benefits and potential risks, confirming eligibility and checking on insurance coverage. Pediatricians welcome parents’ questions and work tirelessly to provide answers grounded in the best available evidence so families can make truly informed decisions about their child’s health.
In some cases, unfortunately, even if parents want the vaccine and their pediatrician agrees, they may not be able to get it due to any number of factors, including local supply shortages, lack of insurance coverage, policies that prevent administration by pharmacists and other health providers without clear federal guidance, or an unwillingness of providers to give it “off-label,” meaning in a way that differs from the FDA’s official approval. For those parents, their decision has been made for them.
 
Reducing risks in other ways
Whether or not a child receives an updated COVID-19 vaccine, parents can still take steps to reduce illness, including keeping children home when sick, teaching them cough-and-sneeze hygiene and encouraging frequent hand-washing. The CDC provides national and state data on seasonal respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, while local public health websites often offer community-level information.
Parents should also remember that the COVID-19 vaccine is not the only thing to consider before school starts. Routine immunizations such as those for measles, mumps and rubella, known as the MMR vaccine; diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, called DTaP; and influenza are essential for keeping kids healthy and in school. These are widely available for now. This is particularly important, as this year the United States has experienced the highest number of measles cases in decades.
Uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, and potentially other vaccines, may worsen in the coming weeks and months. It is possible parents will continue to see shifting guidance, conflicting statements from federal agencies and reduced access to vaccines in their communities.
In this chaotic environment, parents can look to trusted sources such as their pediatrician or organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, which will continue to provide independent, evidence-based vaccine guidance.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-16 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Curtailing plastic use can help you and the environment,Judy Benson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/16/curtailing-plastic-use-you-can-help-yourself-and-the-ct-environment/,"Plastic is being found seemingly everywhere in our environment—even our bodies—as a persistent, accumulating toxin, with carcinogens and other hazards.","Breaking a habit is hard, especially when it involves something as ever-present as plastic.
But as Connecticut Sea Grant, Save the Sound and other partners launch our ninth annual monthlong #DontTrashLISound campaign today with a cleanup at Long Wharf Drive in New Haven, the focus is once again raising awareness about the increasing dangers of plastic. It’s being found seemingly everywhere in our environment—even our bodies—as a persistent, accumulating toxin, with carcinogens and other hazards.
“Some estimate that we ingest something like a credit card’s worth of plastic into our bodies every week,” said Jason White, director of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station who’s been researching how plastics are getting into the food we eat. “We need to decrease our exposure to plastics and decrease the massive amounts getting into environment.”
Building on the theme for this year’s campaign of “Better than plastic,” we’ll be sharing ideas on social media about everyday alternatives to plastic. By opting for fresh flowers over balloons at celebrations, metal water bottles instead of throwaway plastic ones and reusable mesh bags for produce over fruits and vegetables in plastic packaging, for example, you’ll be acting both in your own and our collective self-interest for a healthier body and planet. Even using plastic cutlery and cups carries the risk of little bits of plastic being consumed, White said, so every time that’s avoided is a step in the right direction.
But as the saying goes, “don’t let the idea of perfection get in the way of the possible.” Plastic, unfortunately, is here to stay, and avoiding it altogether is virtually impossible. Nevertheless, there’s a lot we can do to reduce its presence in our lives.
If you need more convincing about the dangers of plastic, consider White’s recent research project in collaboration with colleagues from Rutgers University and the New Jersey Institute of Technology. Micro- and nano-plastics, he said, are routinely found in agricultural soils and irrigation water. These are the tiny shards that pass through water treatment plants into the public water supply, end up in fertilizers made from treatment plant waste or are shed off sheets of black plastic mulch commonly used on row crops. White and his colleagues wanted to find out whether these toxic particles were getting into the plants we eat, as well as if they were increasing the accumulation of other environmental pollutants.
They grew wheat in plastic-contaminated soil, and lettuce hydroponically in contaminated water. They found that both the wheat and the lettuce not only absorbed the plastic particles but also increased the accumulation of heavy metals such as arsenic, lead and cadmium as well as PFAS and pesticides such as boscalid.
“Whenever plastic is present, you see a significant increase in other contaminants making their way into the food,” he said. “The problem with this is that there are no regulatory standards on plastic particles in food.
“There is an increasing general realization of the need to decrease plastic use,” he continued, “and this is just another strong piece of evidence for that.”
Indeed, massive amounts of plastics are already in the aquatic and terrestrial environment, everywhere from ocean floor sediments to the bodies of seabirds who nest on remote islands. That’s decades worth of plastic that never goes away like a biodegradable paper bag but just keeps breaking up into smaller and smaller pieces.
For the next phase of his research, White and his colleagues plan to focus on remediation strategies.
“We’d like to come up with a way we can keep plastics out of the food supply,” he said.
In the meantime, please do what you can to use less plastic, and join a cleanup in your neighborhood or nearby beach. Sign up here.  
You’ll be doing good for yourself and the environment at the same time.

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)A board that oversees the management of critical forage fish menhaden along the Atlantic coast is looking into further restricting Virginia’s only commercial menhaden reduction fishery.
The Atlantic States Marine Commission’s menhaden management board voted last week to task a workgroup with determining options for spreading out menhaden reduction fishing caps throughout the year to manage the fish populations in the Chesapeake Bay.
Such a move would only affect Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein, based in Reedville, Virginia. It is already under reduction fishing caps of 51,000 metric tons. This fishery reduces the fish into oil and fishmeal.
Smaller fisheries in the bay use the fish for bait. Some sportsfishers and environmentalists believe too many menhaden are being fished from the Chesapeake. One group of anglers recently penned a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to sign an executive order to protect the fish.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition, conversely, feels the Virginia reduction fishery has been unfairly blamed for issues in the entire ecosystem that could potentially be attributed to environmental challenges or other causes. But more data is needed to nail down the specific impacts on menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay.
Fewer fish prompts quest for more data
Lynn Fegley of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources introduced the motion to begin exploring further restrictions on Omega Protein. Fegley said a smaller fishery in Maryland is suffering because menhaden are not reaching their shores. She claimed that the population of fish is being accounted for in other parts of the Chesapeake Bay, but they are not seeing enough of them in the upper bay.
“The reduction fisheries’ pressure has been increasing in the middle part of the summer … and potentially leading to a choke point where that biomass of menhaden isn’t making its way into Maryland,” said Will Poston, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation’s forage fish manager. “Maryland’s small-scale commercial fisheries, which are stationary gears, pound nets that have a well-established time series of data.”
Catfish to cat food: A new plan to reduce the Chesapeake Bay’s blue catfish population

Maryland experienced a major fish kill of thousands of mostly juvenile menhaden washing up on shore in the summer of 2024, an incident attributed to low oxygen due to water quality issues.
“We understand that this is a coastwide issue. We understand that things are changing … there is significant effort by a large-scale fishery in the Chesapeake Bay. The fish were there but they were not where we are,” Fegley said.
The Menhaden Fisheries Coalition fired back on allegations their operations are preventing the nutrient-rich fish from reaching farther up the bay to Maryland fisheries, as well as leading to osprey populations decreasing.
“Now, when fishermen report low summer menhaden catch, Maryland frames the pound net fishery as a targeted menhaden fishery under threat from Virginia’s ‘intercept’ fleet — itself an incredible stretch to suggest six menhaden fishing boats ‘blockade’ the lower Chesapeake Bay,” the coalition’s statement read.
Fegley also led an effort last year to look into “precautionary management” methods. A workgroup compiled a list of ideas on how to manage the concerns around the menhaden populations but frequently mentioned the need for more data.
The commission’s stock report of menhaden accepted in 2022 for all of the Atlantic Coast states that menhaden are not overfished. But some environmentalists believe that the Chesapeake Bay populations specifically are in decline and the data is getting lost in the big picture.
“I am not saying this is an intercept fishery. What I am saying is that the conditions are changing in such a way that we are having a real fishery problem in Maryland. This is not just about Maryland, it is about an ecosystem that supports the coast,” Fegley said.
Due to the drop in striped bass and osprey populations that rely on the forage fish to survive, conservationists are eager to find a solution. The U.S. Geological Survey presented to the board last summer about the osprey decline.
“Their findings suggested that while the Chesapeake Bay osprey decline was real, it likely stemmed from a complex array of ecological stressors, not simply the availability of menhaden. In fact, USGS explicitly did not attribute osprey declines to menhaden harvest pressure,” the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition said in a statement.
Commercial fishing yields of menhaden have also reportedly dropped in recent years, according to Fegley and other board members, leading them to look for any insight into why it is happening. There have been state-level efforts to fund research in the Virginia General Assembly into the bay’s menhaden populations, but those efforts have not been successful.
“The Chesapeake’s fisheries and predators can’t wait. Menhaden are key to a thriving Chesapeake Bay, and a healthy, productive Chesapeake is vital to the entire Atlantic coast,” said Chris Moore, Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Executive Director. “We appreciate the efforts of those on the ASMFC menhaden management board who have worked to keep this important issue at the forefront.”

In a response to comments made by Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Ocean Harvest said CBF “omits mention of well-documented water quality issues in Maryland that may also explain the localized fishery observations cited.”
The workgroup will collect data on the possibility of the reduction fishing caps being shifted to different parts of the year, as members of the board shared insight into the menhaden populations showing up in the Chesapeake later in the year. The work group will present its ideas on how to manage the fishery caps at the ASMC winter 2026 board meeting.
The board members said “something is going on” but they aren’t sure why the fish are arriving late and not approaching the shore as much as they used to. Fourteen of the board members voted in favor of the work group, with the representatives from Virginia and New Jersey voting against it.
Some of the members pointed out that there are similar concerns around menhaden yields, striped bass population decline, and osprey decline along the coast outside of the Chesapeake Bay. They want to focus research into the cause and how to protect the fish beyond imposing additional restrictions on the one fishery.
“The only real recourse to ensure the health of the ecosystem is to err on the side of conservation and be more risk averse in how (to) manage this industrial fishery that concentrates so much effort in and around Chesapeake Bay,” Poston said.
The 2024 workgroup made multiple recommendations on how to obtain better data around the menhaden populations, such as seasonal or area closures for menhaden reduction fishing, quota days or periods, restricting some gear usage, or further reducing the menhaden reduction fishing cap.

	“We object to the summit. We object to Putin being on American soil. We object to him being on a military base, specifically a military base that has been at the forefront of defense against Russian and Soviet aggression for 60, 70 years. We want to object to (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelenskyy not being invited. Without the victim of Russian aggression, it’s an exercise in carving up somebody else’s territory.”
For Hodes, there is also a personal aspect to his opposition. A West Point classmate, Andrew Webber, died in July 2023 in combat defending Ukraine, he said. “Everything I’m doing here is to honor his memory,” Hodes said.
